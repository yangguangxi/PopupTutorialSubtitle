[Music]

2
00:00:34,089 --> 00:00:37,309
my name is Duncan Birmingham my

3
00:00:37,309 --> 00:00:39,769
speciality is teaching pop-up design and

4
00:00:39,769 --> 00:00:42,109
this is the first in a series of

5
00:00:42,109 --> 00:00:45,829
tutorials showing you how to make highly

6
00:00:45,829 --> 00:00:51,109
complex pop-ups very easy way so I'm

7
00:00:51,109 --> 00:00:52,309
going to start by just running through

8
00:00:52,309 --> 00:00:54,289
the materials the basic materials that

9
00:00:54,289 --> 00:00:59,569
you need are glue scissors and card the

10
00:00:59,569 --> 00:01:03,469
type of card I recommend is 160 GSM you

11
00:01:03,469 --> 00:01:07,369
can use heavier card 180 gsm up to 220

12
00:01:07,369 --> 00:01:10,369
you can also use heavy-duty cartridge

13
00:01:10,369 --> 00:01:12,740
paper really it all depends on the size

14
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:14,659
of the pop-up that you're making but for

15
00:01:14,659 --> 00:01:17,420
these tutorials will be using photocopy

16
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:21,740
cards which is 160 GSM the best glue is

17
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:24,740
solvent based adhesive water base works

18
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:27,049
okay but it tends to make the card

19
00:01:27,049 --> 00:01:29,390
buckle and it goes off more slowly so

20
00:01:29,390 --> 00:01:32,000
it's much harder to work with stick

21
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,219
glues are okay they're nice and clean

22
00:01:34,219 --> 00:01:37,280
and easy to use but they tend to crack

23
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,530
and so after a while yeah your pop-ups

24
00:01:39,530 --> 00:01:42,710
will fall apart the other materials that

25
00:01:42,710 --> 00:01:44,600
you won't need in these first tutorials

26
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:46,399
but in the later ones which are more

27
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:47,329
complex

28
00:01:47,329 --> 00:01:50,479
you need a craft knife the type I really

29
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:53,450
like is this type with a extendable snap

30
00:01:53,450 --> 00:01:56,840
off blade you'll need a ruler a metal

31
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:59,030
ruler is good you can cut long straight

32
00:01:59,030 --> 00:02:03,170
lines against the edge a compass for

33
00:02:03,170 --> 00:02:06,020
drawing circles with and again there's

34
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:07,880
only a few mechanisms that you need this

35
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:11,130
for but it's just a handy tool to have

36
00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:13,800
your tool box you can also use it for

37
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,150
measuring with measuring notes

38
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:17,550
transferring lengths from one one model

39
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:21,660
to another a protractor and set square

40
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:26,850
for measuring angles and a ballpoint pen

41
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:30,300
without any ink so scoring on big pop up

42
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:32,160
scoring can be really important to get a

43
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:35,940
nice clean fold you score it a ballpoint

44
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:38,100
pen with no ink it tends to it just

45
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:40,470
compresses the fibers in the card rather

46
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:43,110
than cutting them so yeah I really

47
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:45,330
recommend ballpoint pen without any ink

48
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:47,370
and of course yeah

49
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:51,180
pencil and rubber you know just always

50
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:57,600
handy less materials now I'd like to

51
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:00,240
start with the most elementary of

52
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:02,640
pop-ups the most elementary pop-ups

53
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,350
we're just going to use a small piece of

54
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:08,460
card like this fold it in the middle all

55
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:11,370
these early tutorials there's absolutely

56
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:13,050
no measuring everything is just done by

57
00:03:13,050 --> 00:03:15,180
eye so you can just cut a small piece of

58
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:18,180
card by eyes fold it in half folds are

59
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:21,510
really important in pop-ups so the more

60
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:23,670
you the more you fold it the most sweet

61
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:26,280
little moves its I always think of folds

62
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:30,750
as like they're like hinges and creasing

63
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:32,340
the fold thoroughly is like greasing the

64
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:36,180
hinge so you take this piece of cards we

65
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:40,890
cut into it just one cut from the folded

66
00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:43,680
edge and then just bend that over so

67
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:47,340
we're bending that over like this so it

68
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:52,430
looks like that fold it back on itself

69
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:58,380
open it up and push that through this is

70
00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:02,600
the most elementary pop-up this type is

71
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:05,760
converging creases so all the all four

72
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,730
creases the spine folds the spoke fold

73
00:04:08,730 --> 00:04:10,230
in the middle and the two on each side

74
00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:15,690
all converge at the same point the other

75
00:04:15,690 --> 00:04:18,480
type of pop-up is parallel creases so we

76
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:21,390
take another card fold it in half fold

77
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:23,600
it thoroughly as usual

78
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:26,180
if time make two cuts again this is the

79
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:28,010
folded edge I'm cutting in from the

80
00:04:28,010 --> 00:04:30,680
folded edge you don't even actually need

81
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:32,810
to use scissors you can actually tear it

82
00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:35,600
the lines don't have to be straight they

83
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,660
can be they can be Wiggly jagged at an

84
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:41,780
angle whatever you like again fold it

85
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:45,920
back so you get this shape fold it back

86
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:50,180
on itself to enhance the creases open it

87
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:53,150
up push it through so you get a kind of

88
00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:56,890
step these two these two pieces

89
00:04:56,890 --> 00:04:59,720
demonstrate the basic underlying

90
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:02,480
principles of all pop ups all pop ups

91
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:05,540
either all the creases meet at the same

92
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:08,290
points they're converging creases

93
00:05:08,290 --> 00:05:10,670
meeting at the same point on the spine

94
00:05:10,670 --> 00:05:13,580
the other type of parallel creases so

95
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:15,980
all the creases are parallel to the

96
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:17,900
spine and these are the two underlying

97
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:21,830
principles in all pop ups so this type

98
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:23,780
of proper mechanism is called counter

99
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:26,600
folds and here's an example that I did

100
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:29,120
with some school kids and so this is

101
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:32,930
counter folds it's it's this type with

102
00:05:32,930 --> 00:05:36,080
converging creases and it's made made

103
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:38,570
into a face and it's just glued on to a

104
00:05:38,570 --> 00:05:41,510
background so this is really basic

105
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:44,720
simple stuff there is a book with some

106
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:49,150
in it this is this is dinner time by

107
00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:52,790
champion Kowski look at the first spread

108
00:05:52,790 --> 00:05:57,230
and it's one of these v-folds converging

109
00:05:57,230 --> 00:06:01,970
crease converging creases pop-ups we can

110
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:03,680
also look at the last spread in this

111
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:08,030
book and here it is this bottom jaw of

112
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:10,250
this shark is converging creases this is

113
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:12,350
the V fold and the top drawer of the

114
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:15,710
shark is a parallel fold you can always

115
00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:17,600
tell parallel folds if you look at the

116
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:20,780
book end on you can look down the spine

117
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:23,060
and you can see that although all the

118
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:27,560
creases are parallel this type of

119
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:30,620
mechanism can be applied to any folds in

120
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:33,230
any pop-up and so you can use this type

121
00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:35,960
of mechanism as actual part of the

122
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:37,250
sculpting of the

123
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:39,620
the sculpture or it can be used as just

124
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:41,900
the muscle to raise a larger piece of

125
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:44,900
card so if we look at this book and this

126
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:48,410
is jungle days by Helen bomber and this

127
00:06:48,410 --> 00:06:52,160
is an example of a counter fold being

128
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:55,160
used to scalp the actual pop-up so this

129
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:59,240
here this is the counter fold as the

130
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:02,630
book closes as it opens you can see how

131
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:04,190
it moves and yet this is all made from

132
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:06,110
one flat piece of card you can actually

133
00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:08,690
close the book and just open and close

134
00:07:08,690 --> 00:07:10,850
it like that so this is the counter fold

135
00:07:10,850 --> 00:07:13,460
being used as part of the sculpture of

136
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:20,810
the design this book this is robot by

137
00:07:20,810 --> 00:07:24,970
champion Kowski in this pop-up spread

138
00:07:24,970 --> 00:07:28,310
these counter folds he's used these type

139
00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:31,100
of converging crease counter folds these

140
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:33,940
are the muscles to move larger pieces so

141
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:39,230
this is a parallel fold and then here on

142
00:07:39,230 --> 00:07:41,090
each side you've got these small counter

143
00:07:41,090 --> 00:07:44,900
folds that are used to as the muscle to

144
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:47,300
lift these two little robots and so as

145
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:50,090
the page opens and closes you can see

146
00:07:50,090 --> 00:07:52,280
the counter folds that muscles are

147
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:56,630
moving those two two small robots but

148
00:07:56,630 --> 00:07:59,030
this type of pop-up these elementary

149
00:07:59,030 --> 00:08:01,550
pop-ups when the page is flat the pop-up

150
00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:03,470
is flat and they're not actually true

151
00:08:03,470 --> 00:08:05,210
pop-ups they're more like something you

152
00:08:05,210 --> 00:08:07,669
can add to pop-ups so I'm going to show

153
00:08:07,669 --> 00:08:10,190
you how to make two pop-ups one

154
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:15,910
converging creases one parallel creases

155
00:08:15,910 --> 00:08:18,290
there are three principals three

156
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:20,030
important principles that apply to all

157
00:08:20,030 --> 00:08:22,250
pop-ups the first one is that every

158
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:25,130
pop-up must span a galley so this is a

159
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:28,580
base sheet we fold it in half do it by

160
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:32,659
eye crease it really thoroughly fold it

161
00:08:32,659 --> 00:08:37,490
back on itself crease it again this is

162
00:08:37,490 --> 00:08:41,719
your base sheet this is the galley

163
00:08:41,719 --> 00:08:43,700
it's the galley opening that will power

164
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:47,270
the pop-up I'll take a piece to make the

165
00:08:47,270 --> 00:08:53,329
pop-ups with

166
00:08:53,329 --> 00:08:55,829
so do it again everything everything is

167
00:08:55,829 --> 00:08:57,990
done by eye you just cut the piece of

168
00:08:57,990 --> 00:09:07,199
card in half fold it in half crease it

169
00:09:07,199 --> 00:09:10,259
really thoroughly and the second

170
00:09:10,259 --> 00:09:13,740
principle is that pop-ups must must

171
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:15,630
balance on each side of the galleys

172
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:18,209
so pop-ups maths Panigale they must

173
00:09:18,209 --> 00:09:19,740
stick down to both sides of the galley

174
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:21,600
and then they must balance on each side

175
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:24,269
of the gully so in this case we're

176
00:09:24,269 --> 00:09:27,779
making a converging crease of V folds so

177
00:09:27,779 --> 00:09:30,060
with v-folds it's the angles that

178
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:33,389
balance so here's the pop-up piece we're

179
00:09:33,389 --> 00:09:36,389
folding the tabs onto the bottom which

180
00:09:36,389 --> 00:09:44,339
will glue to the page by doing it this

181
00:09:44,339 --> 00:09:46,709
way we've made the two the two angles on

182
00:09:46,709 --> 00:09:48,569
each side of the pop-up at the same in

183
00:09:48,569 --> 00:09:53,389
this case they're both ninety degrees

184
00:09:53,389 --> 00:09:58,459
again reinforce those those folds so

185
00:09:58,459 --> 00:10:01,949
we've got there the angles on the pop-up

186
00:10:01,949 --> 00:10:05,040
a balancing now we've got to stick it to

187
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:08,790
the page and the two angles on the base

188
00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:13,009
we've got to balance so we get the glue

189
00:10:13,009 --> 00:10:18,240
my secret with glue is to put the glue

190
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:21,389
on on just on one side and then I always

191
00:10:21,389 --> 00:10:24,089
use my little finger I use my little

192
00:10:24,089 --> 00:10:26,550
finger so that I can spread the glue

193
00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:29,779
really evenly but my fingers remain

194
00:10:29,779 --> 00:10:32,819
dextra so I can handle other things and

195
00:10:32,819 --> 00:10:34,949
without them getting stuck it's really

196
00:10:34,949 --> 00:10:36,540
important that the glue goes right up to

197
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:38,610
the crease the crease in pop up is

198
00:10:38,610 --> 00:10:40,439
really important the glue goes to the

199
00:10:40,439 --> 00:10:42,209
crease all measuring is done to the

200
00:10:42,209 --> 00:10:46,139
crease so here we go the central crease

201
00:10:46,139 --> 00:10:48,480
is lined up with the gully and stick

202
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:51,149
that side down now you fold the whole

203
00:10:51,149 --> 00:10:56,600
piece shut put glue on the other side

204
00:10:56,600 --> 00:11:01,230
again smear the glue up to the crease

205
00:11:01,230 --> 00:11:07,620
shut the base press it well and here's

206
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:10,350
the first pop-up so in this case every

207
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:12,210
pop out spans a gully and then the

208
00:11:12,210 --> 00:11:14,010
second principle is every pop-up

209
00:11:14,010 --> 00:11:15,870
misbalance on each side of the gully

210
00:11:15,870 --> 00:11:18,510
with v-folds where the crease is all

211
00:11:18,510 --> 00:11:20,010
converge at the same point

212
00:11:20,010 --> 00:11:23,100
it's the angles at balance so the angles

213
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:25,050
on the base here are both the same size

214
00:11:25,050 --> 00:11:27,510
the angles on the pop up are both the

215
00:11:27,510 --> 00:11:31,170
same size so if we call this a and this

216
00:11:31,170 --> 00:11:34,260
B we've got a plus B on one side we've

217
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:36,240
got a plus B on the other side so the

218
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:41,270
angles balanced this is the basic v-fold

219
00:11:41,270 --> 00:11:42,830
[Music]

220
00:11:42,830 --> 00:11:45,870
there are five configurations of these

221
00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:47,790
folders so I'm going to show you the

222
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:53,970
other the other five so this is the type

223
00:11:53,970 --> 00:11:55,860
we've just made this is the right angle

224
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:58,380
v-folds the angles on the pop-up are

225
00:11:58,380 --> 00:12:05,730
both 90 degrees this is the acute angle

226
00:12:05,730 --> 00:12:07,920
v-fold the angles on the pop-up they're

227
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:09,930
still both the same but the angles are

228
00:12:09,930 --> 00:12:15,840
both less than 90 degrees this one is

229
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:18,030
the pointy v-folds this is a variation

230
00:12:18,030 --> 00:12:20,520
on this acute angle but in this case

231
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:24,780
even more extreme this is the this is

232
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:27,990
the obtuse angle default so the angles

233
00:12:27,990 --> 00:12:29,970
on the pop-up are both more than 90

234
00:12:29,970 --> 00:12:31,470
degrees they're still the same on each

235
00:12:31,470 --> 00:12:34,140
side and the angles on the on the base

236
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:36,120
are still the same on each side so

237
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:38,580
you've got balance and then this is the

238
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:41,040
final most most intriguing of the

239
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,840
v-folds really this is the asymmetric

240
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:46,170
v-fold so the angles on each side on the

241
00:12:46,170 --> 00:12:49,170
pop-up are different and the angles on

242
00:12:49,170 --> 00:12:50,850
the base are different you've got four

243
00:12:50,850 --> 00:12:53,640
different angles but the angle on the

244
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:56,340
base on one side plus the angle on the

245
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:59,250
pop-up equals the angle on the base on

246
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:01,440
the other side plus the angle on the

247
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,510
pop-up so you still have balance even

248
00:13:03,510 --> 00:13:07,590
though all four angles are different

249
00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:09,840
[Music]

250
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:12,730
now I'll make a pop-up version of the

251
00:13:12,730 --> 00:13:37,120
parallel fold take another base and

252
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:39,310
here's a pop up piece so this is

253
00:13:39,310 --> 00:13:40,450
parallel fold

254
00:13:40,450 --> 00:13:43,780
so in this case we make the the fold at

255
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:47,680
the outer edges when you make when you

256
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:49,810
make gluing tabs they should never be

257
00:13:49,810 --> 00:13:53,950
less than half an inch or one centimeter

258
00:13:53,950 --> 00:13:56,710
because pop-ups tend to they generate

259
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:59,740
quite a lot of stress on the tabs so you

260
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:03,460
need them to be fairly wide to take the

261
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:06,130
stress of opening and closing so this is

262
00:14:06,130 --> 00:14:08,230
going to be the parallel fold and you

263
00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:10,120
can actually play around with these you

264
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:12,190
can have it really wide on the page or

265
00:14:12,190 --> 00:14:15,430
you can have it pretty close I tend to

266
00:14:15,430 --> 00:14:19,330
actually cut off the corners of gluing

267
00:14:19,330 --> 00:14:23,830
tabs I just think the when they're under

268
00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:25,930
a bit less sharp they tend to snag less

269
00:14:25,930 --> 00:14:28,720
it doesn't matter whether whether

270
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:32,230
they're inside like this or whether

271
00:14:32,230 --> 00:14:36,250
they're outside like this you can you

272
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:38,170
know that the position of the tab

273
00:14:38,170 --> 00:14:39,760
doesn't matter the only thing that

274
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:43,030
matters is the position of the crease so

275
00:14:43,030 --> 00:14:45,520
here is by put by folding it in half and

276
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:47,620
then folding the tabs on we've got

277
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:49,690
balance on the pop-up piece the lengths

278
00:14:49,690 --> 00:14:53,620
both sides are the same so again we just

279
00:14:53,620 --> 00:15:02,730
put glue on glue on one side

280
00:15:02,730 --> 00:15:08,950
snoo on well right up to the crease I'm

281
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:10,990
gonna have these these tabs on the

282
00:15:10,990 --> 00:15:14,380
inside so we'll stick it down there the

283
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:16,560
crease is parallel to the central gully

284
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:20,410
then fold the whole piece shut put glue

285
00:15:20,410 --> 00:15:31,410
on the other tab smear it up to the edge

286
00:15:31,410 --> 00:15:34,030
and close the base so it finds its

287
00:15:34,030 --> 00:15:42,330
natural sticking position so this is a

288
00:15:42,330 --> 00:15:44,710
this is a parallel fold this is a

289
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:51,130
symmetric parallel fold there are three

290
00:15:51,130 --> 00:15:54,880
kinds of parallel fold this is the this

291
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:58,150
is a symmetric equal parallel fold both

292
00:15:58,150 --> 00:16:00,580
both sides are the same both lengths on

293
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:03,310
the on the pop-up at the same and the

294
00:16:03,310 --> 00:16:05,350
distance from where it glues down to the

295
00:16:05,350 --> 00:16:07,570
spine is the same so on the left you've

296
00:16:07,570 --> 00:16:09,490
got a short bit on the base and a long

297
00:16:09,490 --> 00:16:11,860
bit on the pop-up on the right you've

298
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:13,930
got a short bit on the base and along

299
00:16:13,930 --> 00:16:16,630
with it on the pop-up this is the second

300
00:16:16,630 --> 00:16:18,190
type of parallel fold this is the

301
00:16:18,190 --> 00:16:20,380
parallelogram you look at it this way on

302
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:23,830
and you can see on one side on the left

303
00:16:23,830 --> 00:16:26,500
you've got a short length on the pop-up

304
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:29,050
and they're long lengths on the base on

305
00:16:29,050 --> 00:16:31,030
the right you've got a short length on

306
00:16:31,030 --> 00:16:32,830
the base and a long length on the pop-up

307
00:16:32,830 --> 00:16:35,230
so again you've got balance the length

308
00:16:35,230 --> 00:16:40,150
balance and the last one this is the

309
00:16:40,150 --> 00:16:43,780
this is the asymmetric parallel fold so

310
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:46,630
all four lengths are different so on the

311
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:48,850
Left you've got quite a long bit on the

312
00:16:48,850 --> 00:16:50,680
base and the short bit on the pop-up on

313
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:53,320
the right you've got a short bit on the

314
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:55,120
base and a long bit on the pop-up

315
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:58,210
so as the whole thing closes you can see

316
00:16:58,210 --> 00:17:00,790
from the spine fold to the leading

317
00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:03,250
leading fold the two sides are the same

318
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:08,680
the the pop-up is balanced on v-folds is

319
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:11,770
the angles at balanced on parallel folds

320
00:17:11,770 --> 00:17:14,170
it's the lengths at balance and the

321
00:17:14,170 --> 00:17:15,020
third

322
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:19,130
the third principle is that every pop-up

323
00:17:19,130 --> 00:17:27,800
creates gullies so the first principle

324
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:30,390
every pop-up my spanner gully and the

325
00:17:30,390 --> 00:17:32,790
first gully is the spine fold the second

326
00:17:32,790 --> 00:17:34,920
principle every pop-up must balance on

327
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:37,770
each site v-folds it's the angles

328
00:17:37,770 --> 00:17:40,320
balanced parallel folds it's the length

329
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:42,240
of balance and then the third principle

330
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:44,640
is that every pop-up creates gullies and

331
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:47,640
you can stick pop-ups into those gullies

332
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:49,920
so here's a gully on a parallel fold you

333
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:52,110
could stick this in like this or you

334
00:17:52,110 --> 00:17:54,390
could stick this this one in like this

335
00:17:54,390 --> 00:17:58,220
and on on the V folds again you've got

336
00:17:58,220 --> 00:18:00,810
you've got these gullies you can stick

337
00:18:00,810 --> 00:18:03,330
it into on the back as the page closes

338
00:18:03,330 --> 00:18:06,540
the the pop-up will close or you've also

339
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:09,690
got a gully here you can stick there you

340
00:18:09,690 --> 00:18:11,670
can stick the pop-up into the gully you

341
00:18:11,670 --> 00:18:14,610
can stick it any height you like in some

342
00:18:14,610 --> 00:18:21,330
way I've got a an example here is this

343
00:18:21,330 --> 00:18:25,230
is a this is a v-fold the blue piece is

344
00:18:25,230 --> 00:18:26,670
a v-fold

345
00:18:26,670 --> 00:18:28,710
and there's pop-up stacking this is a

346
00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:31,440
parallel fold stuck into this gully and

347
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:34,050
this is converging creases or stuck into

348
00:18:34,050 --> 00:18:36,510
this gully all these are different forms

349
00:18:36,510 --> 00:18:39,120
of of pop-up stuck into the different

350
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:41,070
gullies here you've got an example of a

351
00:18:41,070 --> 00:18:44,100
counter fold like that like this piece

352
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:46,890
this is this is a big counter fold is

353
00:18:46,890 --> 00:18:48,870
the same principle applied to this piece

354
00:18:48,870 --> 00:18:57,000
of pop-up there's three ways you can use

355
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,550
the base either the base can either be a

356
00:18:59,550 --> 00:19:02,430
base that the pop-up rises from it can

357
00:19:02,430 --> 00:19:04,260
be a background that the pop-up comes

358
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:07,050
forward from or it can be a base and a

359
00:19:07,050 --> 00:19:09,450
background and with the pop-up stuck

360
00:19:09,450 --> 00:19:12,030
into the gummy so the first one I'd like

361
00:19:12,030 --> 00:19:14,880
to show you is this is Christopher

362
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:18,540
Columbus bye subasta it's a pop-up from

363
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:19,380
the 50s

364
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:22,980
this is using this is using the base as

365
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:25,920
a as a base with the pop-up rising from

366
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:26,700
it

367
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:31,380
there is and this is if you actually

368
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:34,320
look at it from the top you can see it's

369
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:36,660
based on v-folds although where it's

370
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:39,270
glued to the page all the creases will

371
00:19:39,270 --> 00:19:42,600
converge at the same point so this is

372
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:47,040
this is a pop-up using using the base as

373
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:51,710
a base with the pop-up rising from it

374
00:19:51,710 --> 00:19:54,720
the second way you can you can use the

375
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,690
base is with the base as a background

376
00:19:56,690 --> 00:19:59,100
with the pop-up coming forward from it

377
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:01,500
this is the little fish who cried shark

378
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:05,880
so if we open this one up this is using

379
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:09,690
the the base as a background so you've

380
00:20:09,690 --> 00:20:11,490
got the pop-up coming forward from it

381
00:20:11,490 --> 00:20:14,220
and in this case again both both halves

382
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:16,440
of the design they're based on V folds

383
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:18,960
and they look to me like a symmetric

384
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:22,050
v-folds so the angles on the two pop up

385
00:20:22,050 --> 00:20:25,530
each side of the popups are different so

386
00:20:25,530 --> 00:20:28,440
this is using the pop-up as a as a

387
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:33,210
background and the third kind is a it's

388
00:20:33,210 --> 00:20:36,120
another capacitor again it's from the

389
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:41,210
50s it's the base and the background so

390
00:20:41,210 --> 00:20:44,760
so that that's the last thing I want to

391
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:47,910
talk about really techniques and then

392
00:20:47,910 --> 00:20:49,440
the last thing I'd like to say is almost

393
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:52,230
all all popups use a combination of

394
00:20:52,230 --> 00:20:54,900
mechanisms so I've got a few examples

395
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:58,920
here this is when I made this is this is

396
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:02,130
V folds all three folds and then this V

397
00:21:02,130 --> 00:21:04,890
fold at the front is raising raising

398
00:21:04,890 --> 00:21:07,770
this the dog and the dog is made of a

399
00:21:07,770 --> 00:21:10,980
whole series of parallelograms so this

400
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:12,870
is a combination this design is a

401
00:21:12,870 --> 00:21:14,730
combination of V folds and

402
00:21:14,730 --> 00:21:19,740
parallelograms and then this is a this

403
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:21,900
is a really early pop-up this pop-up is

404
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:24,300
from the 30s this is from a series

405
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:27,210
called the Baccano series and this is

406
00:21:27,210 --> 00:21:30,090
number 15 I think they're about 30 and

407
00:21:30,090 --> 00:21:33,030
the designer was a guy called Louisa

408
00:21:33,030 --> 00:21:36,570
roan and so here is this is a this is a

409
00:21:36,570 --> 00:21:39,390
pop-up again you can see the the basic

410
00:21:39,390 --> 00:21:39,960
part

411
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:42,780
is a v-fold and the v-fold is raising

412
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:44,940
parallelograms raising these other

413
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:47,190
images so if you look at it this way

414
00:21:47,190 --> 00:21:49,350
around you'll see that these other

415
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:52,080
images of parallelograms raised by the

416
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:54,980
v-fold

417
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:58,560
and then this is a more modern one this

418
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:02,430
is David Pellom Appleby's shapes and

419
00:22:02,430 --> 00:22:05,820
this is this is the same thing here we

420
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:11,910
have it Appleby's shapes it's a it's a

421
00:22:11,910 --> 00:22:16,470
v-fold it's a cute angle v-fold again

422
00:22:16,470 --> 00:22:18,900
it's raising parallelograms so you look

423
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:20,370
at it this way around and you can see

424
00:22:20,370 --> 00:22:24,470
it's parallelograms raised by the v-fold

425
00:22:24,470 --> 00:22:27,240
and there's another one here this is one

426
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:30,000
of my favorites this is Chuck Murphy

427
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,290
black cat white cat and in this case

428
00:22:33,290 --> 00:22:36,560
you've got this it's quite extraordinary

429
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:40,170
construction this is the v-fold the the

430
00:22:40,170 --> 00:22:43,740
box is the v-fold it's actually a this

431
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:45,780
is a parallelogram the back of the box

432
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:48,210
but it's this front half of the box is

433
00:22:48,210 --> 00:22:49,980
the v-fold which is raising the whole

434
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:52,320
structure you look at it this way around

435
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:53,970
and you can see the ladder and

436
00:22:53,970 --> 00:22:56,640
everything else is parallel folds and

437
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:59,850
it's it's all raised by the by the

438
00:22:59,850 --> 00:23:02,910
v-fold the v-fold box raises the whole

439
00:23:02,910 --> 00:23:07,230
structure and then the last one and this

440
00:23:07,230 --> 00:23:10,530
is fantastic fantastic fairytales

441
00:23:10,530 --> 00:23:13,640
I think this barrier Ron van der Meer

442
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:17,700
and here we have it in this case this is

443
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:21,900
a this is a right angle V fold raising

444
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:23,700
parallelograms you look at it this way

445
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:26,910
as the as the page closes the

446
00:23:26,910 --> 00:23:28,980
parallelograms lifts up you look at it

447
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:32,130
straight on you can see this is the

448
00:23:32,130 --> 00:23:34,140
gully that this parallelogram is built

449
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:36,420
into this is the galley that the next

450
00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:38,310
one is built into this is the gulley

451
00:23:38,310 --> 00:23:42,770
that the next one is built into so

452
00:23:42,770 --> 00:23:45,210
that's it for this tutorial

453
00:23:45,210 --> 00:23:47,970
if you want to follow it that this is my

454
00:23:47,970 --> 00:23:50,310
book pop-up design and paper mechanics

455
00:23:50,310 --> 00:23:51,810
everything we've looked at

456
00:23:51,810 --> 00:23:54,220
they is in this book
