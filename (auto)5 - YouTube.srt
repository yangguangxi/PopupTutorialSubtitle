这是平行折章节的第一部分


2
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:46,820
blue scissors and card and the details
需要的材料 胶水 剪刀和卡纸

3
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:48,410
of these are all explained in the
具体在教程1里解释过了
三种类型的平行折

4
00:00:48,410 --> 00:00:55,340
introductory tutorial so there are three
这有三种平行折

5
00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:59,890
kinds of parallel fault the first and
第一种 也差不多是最重要的

6
00:00:59,890 --> 00:01:02,059
possibly the most important is the
平行四边形

7
00:01:02,059 --> 00:01:04,670
parallelogram the parallelogram is a
平行四边形蛮有趣的

8
00:01:04,670 --> 00:01:06,679
funny one when you open the base flat
当展开页面

9
00:01:06,679 --> 00:01:09,709
the parallelogram goes flat it's only in
平行四边形也会摊平

10
00:01:09,709 --> 00:01:12,350
dimension when the bases it's on is is
只在页面展开过程中是立体的

11
00:01:12,350 --> 00:01:17,450
not flat the other two are the symmetric
另外两种分别是'对称平行折'

12
00:01:17,450 --> 00:01:20,209
parallel fold so the length on each side
立起结构两侧

13
00:01:20,209 --> 00:01:22,450
of the pop-up are exactly the same and
长度完全一致

14
00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:26,569
the asymmetric parallel folds where the
'非对称平行折'

15
00:01:26,569 --> 00:01:28,429
two lengths on the pop-up are different
立起结构两侧长度不同

16
00:01:28,429 --> 00:01:31,639
so these last two we'll be doing in part
后两种在第二部分展开说

17
00:01:31,639 --> 00:01:34,939
two parallel folds this this tutorial is
这节教程完全献给

18
00:01:34,939 --> 00:01:39,969
completely devoted to the parallelogram
平行四边形

19
00:01:39,969 --> 00:01:42,889
parallelograms can be used quite nicely
平行四边形在组合结构里很好用

20
00:01:42,889 --> 00:01:46,909
in combination so here's an example you
这是个例子

21
00:01:46,909 --> 00:01:49,389
can use them this way with the base as a
你可以像这样

22
00:01:49,389 --> 00:01:52,520
base card as a base and a background in
把它们用作背景

23
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:54,560
which case this has created a whole
重叠多个图板

24
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,599
series of plates and you can stick
上面可以

25
00:01:56,599 --> 00:01:58,459
bigger pieces of card onto any of those
粘一些别的元素

26
00:01:58,459 --> 00:02:01,579
either vertical or horizontal so you can
不管是垂直还是水平方向

27
00:02:01,579 --> 00:02:02,630
play with it that way
你可以这样横着玩

28
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:05,450
you can also play in it this way so yeah
也可以这样竖着玩

29
00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:08,209
lots of potential there so first I just
有很多可能性

30
00:02:08,209 --> 00:02:10,530
like to show some examples of the
我想先展示些例子

31
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:13,260
so this is Yankee and Cassidy's haunted house
先看下这本《鬼屋》

32
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:16,170
house on the first page we have this
第一页的楼梯

33
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:17,880
staircase this is actually two
这里有两个平行四边形

34
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:20,510
parallelograms this is the first one
右侧这是第一个

35
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:23,069
built into the gulley created by the
紧靠书中间谷沟

36
00:02:23,069 --> 00:02:25,980
book this is the second one built into
左侧二楼这是另一个

37
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:27,690
the gulley created by the first
依附在前一个平行四边形的谷沟

38
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:30,120
parallelogram and when the page goes
页面完全展开时

39
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:33,810
flat the whole pop up goes flat the
立起结构也完全展开

40
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:37,080
second one this is a symmetric parallel
第二个 这是个对称平行折

41
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:39,780
fold so this fridge here the two sides
画面左右两侧是相同的

42
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:42,090
on each side they're both the same so
页面摊平时

43
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:44,550
when the page is flat the pop-up stands
立起结构弹起

44
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:48,030
up this is the third one this is one of
第三个

45
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:50,160
the other uses of the parallelogram is
这是平行四边形的另一种用法

46
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:53,489
it it creates that you can use it to to
用来制作动臂

47
00:02:53,489 --> 00:02:55,380
make moving arms move and we'll be
这个在之后教程有详解

48
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:56,819
looking at that later in this tutorial
我们到时见

49
00:02:56,819 --> 00:03:01,650
the next page well this is a this is a
下一页

50
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:03,360
curved shape that we look at in a much
这是个弧形结构

51
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,880
later tutorial but down here at the bath
也是之后教程内容 在这我们先注意

52
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:08,340
that is a that is a parallelogram you
底部澡盆这是个平行四边形

53
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:11,519
can look at it straight on as the page
可以直接看到

54
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:14,489
goes flat the bath goes flat so that's
页面展开时 它也摊平了

55
00:03:14,489 --> 00:03:16,650
haunted house the other one I'd like to
这就是《鬼屋》几个例子

56
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:19,100
show you is sergeant charge
另一个要看的是《军士长》

57
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:22,650
this is sergeant charge illustrated by
作者是

58
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:26,390
Bill Bolton and if we look at this one
赵四

59
00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:29,370
this is a parallelogram being used to
看下这一页   这是个平行四边形

60
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:31,769
turn over these figures so these are all
用来翻人物

61
00:03:31,769 --> 00:03:34,290
slotted on but the basic strip that
画面元素都是用插槽串起来的

62
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:35,670
they're all attached to that is a
它们附着的基础纸带

63
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:38,310
parallelogram when the page is flat the
是平行四边形 页面展开时

64
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:40,680
parallelogram is flat but it gives a
是平行四边形摊平

65
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:43,920
really nice action to all those soldier
过程中给那些蚁人还是啥的玩意

66
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:47,160
ants or whatever they are so now I'll
产生很整齐的一个动作

67
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:49,230
show you how to make a parallelogram
现在我来演示 如何制作平行四边形

68
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:52,510
- 制作平行四边形

69
00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:55,940
usually parallelograms are used values
通常 平行四边形就是酱紫

70
00:03:55,940 --> 00:04:04,610
like this so we get a base sheet fold it
拿出卡纸做为基础页

71
00:04:04,610 --> 00:04:14,630
in half fold it really funny take a
折一半 折彻底

72
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:17,799
piece of card to build with we'll use
再拿出张卡纸

73
00:04:17,799 --> 00:04:23,930
pink so here's a pink piece just cut off
就骚粉色吧

74
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:28,970
a strip from one end doesn't matter how
从一端剪出个纸带

75
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:35,090
wide and then we need to actually make
宽度无所谓

76
00:04:35,090 --> 00:04:37,400
it slightly shorter so maybe cut off an
需要稍微短点

77
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:39,979
inch or something and in this case
这里剪掉两三厘米

78
00:04:39,979 --> 00:04:44,050
folder a gluing tab onto each end so
两端折出上胶水的粘口

79
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:46,250
gluing tabs should be roughly 1
粘口大概一厘米宽

80
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:50,270
centimeter wide or half an inch unless
如果有别的用途

81
00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:51,800
you want them to be showing in which
你可以留出更大点粘口

82
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:55,090
case you can make them much bigger so

83
00:04:55,090 --> 00:04:59,270
here it is and then you follow the
注意如果从

84
00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:01,430
crease noting the middle that would be
纸带中间折叠

85
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:05,419
that would give you a symmetric parallel
得到的会是平行折

86
00:05:05,419 --> 00:05:06,800
fold in this case because it's a
而我们想要的是平行四边形

87
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:09,650
parallelogram just make the make the
所以在

88
00:05:09,650 --> 00:05:12,380
crease say a third of the way along or
三到四分之一地方折叠

89
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:16,490
1/4 of the way and of so you've got two
会得到两个不同长度

90
00:05:16,490 --> 00:05:20,690
different lengths so this time put the
这时 把纸带折线

91
00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:23,030
central crease on to your on to your
放在基础页中折线对齐

92
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:25,520
central put the crease on the pop-up on

93
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,039
to your central guarding of the base

94
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:30,380
mark where the where the crease lies
标记下折痕一边

95
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:34,820
either end it doesn't matter flip it
画个线即可长度不那么重要

96
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:36,530
round this is the important thing with
最重要的

97
00:05:36,530 --> 00:05:38,660
these you flip it round so that the long
纸带翻个面

98
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:41,270
side is over the short piece on the base
这样 纸带长的一边会对到短的基础页

99
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:44,000
and the short side is over the long one
短的一边在基础页长的一边上方

100
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,370
and then you can because the
平行四边形

101
00:05:46,370 --> 00:05:48,770
parallelogram lies flat when the whole
在基础页完全展开时是摊平的

102
00:05:48,770 --> 00:05:51,260
whole base is flat you can actually glue
所以可以

103
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:55,070
both ends at the same time we just put a
同时给纸带两端上胶水

104
00:05:55,070 --> 00:06:11,120
bit of glue on there
开始上胶水

105
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:14,580
and the tabs can actually point in or
粘口藏起来

106
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:16,470
out it that it really doesn't matter if
还是露外面无所谓的

107
00:06:16,470 --> 00:06:17,190
you want them
如果要它们

108
00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:18,960
it's where the crease lies that's
注意要把粘口折痕粘到标记线

109
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:23,069
important you have the tab in it's
粘口收起来挺重要的

110
00:06:23,069 --> 00:06:24,630
hidden from view when you open it or you
它会从视觉上隐藏

111
00:06:24,630 --> 00:06:26,819
can have it out as part of the design so
打开立起结构又会出现

112
00:06:26,819 --> 00:06:29,910
there it is as the as the page closes
可以把这个特性作为设计的一部分

113
00:06:29,910 --> 00:06:32,580
the parallelogram closes it's good good
像这样 合上基础页 平行四边形页页合上了

114
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:34,620
idea to really give it a good squash afterwards

115
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:37,530
afterwards just in case you're you're

116
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:39,569
measuring or gluing is a bit off so here
这样就行了

117
00:06:39,569 --> 00:06:42,539
it is and you can use it this way or you
你可以这样竖着使用平行四边形

118
00:06:42,539 --> 00:06:45,300
can use it this way or you can use it
可以平展开 也可以横着

119
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:47,190
this way so I'll just show you a couple
我下面展示些书中例子

120
00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:49,500
of examples where books are made using
把平行四边形

121
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:51,930
parallelograms with the base as a base
用作基础结构或者背景

122
00:06:51,930 --> 00:06:55,830
and the background so the first one I'd
第一个要展示的是

123
00:06:55,830 --> 00:06:58,729
like to show you is cabassa
《穿靴子的猫》

124
00:06:58,729 --> 00:07:03,300
puss-in-boots and the last spread is
最后页是个

125
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:07,139
this fantastic fairytale coach made
童话里的南瓜车

126
00:07:07,139 --> 00:07:09,719
completely out of parallelograms if you
完全是用平行四边形做的

127
00:07:09,719 --> 00:07:12,840
turn it turn it and look at it end on
从侧面看就能明显看出

128
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:15,479
you'll see it's all parallelograms as
书本合上时

129
00:07:15,479 --> 00:07:17,280
you close it so the parallelograms
所有平行四边形也会折叠起来

130
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:20,130
closed down the other one I'd like to
另一本要看的是这个

131
00:07:20,130 --> 00:07:23,009
show you is this one don't go out
《今晚别出门》

132
00:07:23,009 --> 00:07:27,620
tonight by Babbitt Cole and in this one
这本书每一页都用类似的设计

133
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:30,150
every spread in this book is the same

134
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:33,210
the same type of design as you pull down
当拉下基础页

135
00:07:33,210 --> 00:07:36,630
the base so the pop-up appears and if
立起结构就会显现

136
00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:38,870
you look at these from end on or
如果从侧面看

137
00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:41,190
sideways on you'll see that the whole
会发现所有机关都是

138
00:07:41,190 --> 00:07:43,139
the whole thing is a series of
平行四边形的组合

139
00:07:43,139 --> 00:07:45,150
parallelograms as you open and close it
开启或合上书本时

140
00:07:45,150 --> 00:07:51,690
the parallelograms becomes 3d
平行四边形会有立体效果

141
00:07:51,690 --> 00:07:55,270
okay no I'd like to show you how to
现在演示

142
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:58,390
build with parallelograms onto a v-fold
如何在V形折上添加平行四边形

143
00:07:58,390 --> 00:08:01,720
so here's a v-fold made in one of the
这个是之前V形折课上做的

144
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:05,500
v-fold tutorials and we're going to
一个V形折

145
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:06,700
build a parallelogram
现在我们要在上面加平行四边形

146
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:08,440
there's gullies to build into there's a
平行四边形可以加在V形折侧的谷沟

147
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:10,750
gully here and on both sides whether
两侧都可以

148
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:13,060
we're the v-fold is attached to the page
V形折向页面合的时候

149
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:16,120
there's also a gunny in the middle in
V折背面也是个谷沟

150
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:18,130
the middle of the v-fold but again you
可以看到V折合起时

151
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:20,170
can see the gully closes as the v-fold
谷沟也会折叠

152
00:08:20,170 --> 00:08:22,210
closes so we'll just take a couple of
我们从前面用了一半的卡纸

153
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:25,510
pieces of the fridge discards take a
剪下两片纸带

154
00:08:25,510 --> 00:08:37,840
couple of slices off it so you take the

155
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:40,510
strip of cards start by making a fold on
纸带两端折叠

156
00:08:40,510 --> 00:08:46,450
each end crease the fold thoroughly and
要折叠的彻底点

157
00:08:46,450 --> 00:08:50,200
the these two files 1h and these are the
这两个纸带

158
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:53,560
two glowing tabs and the folds are both
各要折出两个粘口

159
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:56,920
parallel and then you make another fold
粘口都是平行的

160
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:59,290
roughly 1/3 of the way in it really
在大约1/3位置折一下

161
00:08:59,290 --> 00:09:00,940
doesn't matter it depends what type of
不用担心 折多少不依赖

162
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:03,880
shape you wanting to create
你打算做的形状

163
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:05,980
but I'll go for roughly a third of the way along
我这里要做的是三分之一左右

164
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:09,250
way along so that's a third parallel
这是第三平行折

165
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:15,280
crease crease it really well and then
折仔细

166
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:17,290
I'll just trim off these corners it's
我要剪掉这些角

167
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:20,430
not not mechanically necessary but it
这不是必须步骤

168
00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:23,830
think it stops them stops the jagged
只是觉得剪掉

169
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:25,780
bits snagging on things it seems to just
会少点锯齿

170
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:30,610
glue slightly better and so now you have
粘起来也更好看

171
00:09:30,610 --> 00:09:33,820
a choice you can either put the parallel
现在可以做个选择

172
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:36,370
can parallelogram can either be built
可以粘这样

173
00:09:36,370 --> 00:09:39,310
onto the pop-up like this and a long
长又矮的平行四边形

174
00:09:39,310 --> 00:09:42,430
long and low parallelogram or it can be
或者是

175
00:09:42,430 --> 00:09:45,850
built onto it like this so it's a tall
这样高点的

176
00:09:45,850 --> 00:09:48,490
parallelogram by luck I've got it more
运气蛮好的

177
00:09:48,490 --> 00:09:50,830
or less the same height as a as the
刚好折了个

178
00:09:50,830 --> 00:09:51,550
v-fold
跟V折差不多高

179
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:53,740
so we're going to build a tall
所以就做个高点的平行四边形吧

180
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:56,500
parallelogram so we start by putting the
把平行四边形的折痕

181
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:59,830
the crease of the central crease of the
放在立起结构跟基础页的谷沟位置

182
00:09:59,830 --> 00:10:02,130
parallelogram into the gully

183
00:10:02,130 --> 00:10:05,500
mark weather where the crease lies it's
标记下折痕位置

184
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:07,330
always the crease that you measure to on
通常是测量的折痕是立起结构的

185
00:10:07,330 --> 00:10:10,710
pop-ups so we mark where the crease lies
所以画条线标记

186
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:13,480
and then the crucial bit we flip it over
然后关键点 -- 翻转纸带

187
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:15,700
so you're going to glue the long sides
要把长的一边粘在

188
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:18,700
to the mark you've measured the short
刚标记位置

189
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:20,980
side and you actually glue the long side
测量的是短的一边 实际要粘的是长的一边

190
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:27,190
so we put glue on that tab smear it
给粘口上胶水

191
00:10:27,190 --> 00:10:30,600
right to the right to the crease and
涂均匀

192
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:38,410
then glue the crease to the mark now you
粘到标记上

193
00:10:38,410 --> 00:10:40,180
put the whole parallelogram into its
现在把平行四边形收起到

194
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:41,200
closed position
闭合状态

195
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,270
so the parallelograms in its closed
合上后

196
00:10:43,270 --> 00:10:50,260
position but glue on the other tab and
给另一个粘口上胶水

197
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:53,830
then you can just close the base and it
然后可以合上基础页

198
00:10:53,830 --> 00:10:59,110
finds its natural speaking position so
它会自动对位到自然的位置

199
00:10:59,110 --> 00:11:01,210
there we go we've got parallelogram
就酱 展开页面

200
00:11:01,210 --> 00:11:03,850
rising from the page though we've build
得到了平行四边形

201
00:11:03,850 --> 00:11:07,030
another one into this this gully here so
然后我们给背面V折这里加平行四边形

202
00:11:07,030 --> 00:11:10,420
I'll take another piece of card might as
用刚才另一个纸带

203
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:12,900
well just straighten this up slightly
捋直了

204
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:23,350
and maybe make it slightly shorter okay
发现或许应该短一点

205
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:25,570
we put a tab on each chain just like the
老动作 折粘口

206
00:11:25,570 --> 00:11:42,040
other one another one somewhere not in
另一个粘口

207
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:43,720
the middle again maybe a third of the
三分之一处折叠

208
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:52,350
way

209
00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:55,839
cut off the tabs as the quarters as
粘口跟平时一样 修下角

210
00:11:55,839 --> 00:12:07,210
usual we get on of glue that into this
我们要把纸带粘到这个谷沟

211
00:12:07,210 --> 00:12:13,830
this is going into this gully so put the
比划下先

212
00:12:13,830 --> 00:12:17,230
done it again on just by luck I've just
哎呀呀 运气就是那么好

213
00:12:17,230 --> 00:12:19,089
got it to the right length therefore any
尺寸刚刚好

214
00:12:19,089 --> 00:12:21,550
longer and it wouldn't work so I put
再大一丢丢都放不下了

215
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:24,700
this crease into the central gully I
把一边的折痕跟中间谷沟对齐

216
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:28,810
mark where the fold lives so there's the
标记折痕在的位置

217
00:12:28,810 --> 00:12:33,160
fold the crease line and now again the
再来做"关键动作"

218
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:35,230
crucial bit you flip it around so I've
翻转纸带

219
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:37,630
measured the short lengths flip it round
测量标记的是短的一边

220
00:12:37,630 --> 00:12:39,730
I'm going to stick the long length on to
但是是把

221
00:12:39,730 --> 00:12:43,630
that mark so I put glue on the glue on
长的一边粘到标记位置

222
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:51,970
that tab on the long side and glue it to
给长的一边粘口上胶水

223
00:12:51,970 --> 00:13:01,390
the glue it to the mark there you go and
粘到标记上

224
00:13:01,390 --> 00:13:04,480
this this could be high up on the v-fold
粘在V折高一点还是第一点

225
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,520
or low down on the v-fold doesn't matter
这你随意

226
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:09,400
and now you fold the whole piece into
把纸带折叠到闭合状态

227
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:14,080
its close position put glue on the other
上胶水

228
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:27,330
tab smear it to the crease
涂均匀

229
00:13:27,330 --> 00:13:29,500
then you shut the hole
合上基础页

230
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:32,830
shut the whole base and the tab will
粘口会自动

231
00:13:32,830 --> 00:13:41,820
find its natural sticking position
归位到合适的位置

232
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:44,950
okay I'd just like to explain the the

233
00:13:44,950 --> 00:13:48,670
lengths involved in this so every pop-up

234
00:13:48,670 --> 00:13:51,480
spans a gully so in this case this this

235
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:54,790
parallelogram is spanning this gully and

236
00:13:54,790 --> 00:13:57,130
so every pop-up must be balanced on each

237
00:13:57,130 --> 00:13:59,860
side of the gully so in this case it's

238
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:03,130
this length this length from the gully

239
00:14:03,130 --> 00:14:05,860
on the base to where the long side

240
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:10,690
sticks down this length is the same as

241
00:14:10,690 --> 00:14:15,360
this length and on the on the long side

242
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:18,640
this length the height between where the

243
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:20,920
top up the parallelogram is stuck to the

244
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:24,279
v-fold this height is the same as this

245
00:14:24,279 --> 00:14:26,350
height and so that's what's giving you

246
00:14:26,350 --> 00:14:28,120
that's what's giving you balance when

247
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:30,280
the whole thing is closed you see from

248
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:32,320
the gully on the v-fold you've got the

249
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:34,600
height of the v-fold plus a short bit of

250
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:36,460
the parallelogram and then you've got a

251
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:38,710
short bit of base and the longer to the

252
00:14:38,710 --> 00:14:40,960
parallelogram and if you look at this

253
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:43,839
other one it's the same this this short

254
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:46,420
distance on the v-fold is the same as

255
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:48,220
this short distance on the parallelogram

256
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:51,130
and this long distance on the v-fold is

257
00:14:51,130 --> 00:14:52,690
the same as the long distance on the

258
00:14:52,690 --> 00:14:54,339
parallelogram so that's how you get

259
00:14:54,339 --> 00:14:56,620
balanced with these parallelogram shapes

260
00:14:56,620 --> 00:14:58,780
and I can actually show you this as well

261
00:14:58,780 --> 00:15:00,910
on the on the earlier parallelogram

262
00:15:00,910 --> 00:15:04,030
model I've just pointed out this this

263
00:15:04,030 --> 00:15:06,520
short side on the parallelogram is the

264
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:08,709
same as this short side on the base and

265
00:15:08,709 --> 00:15:10,630
the long side on the parallelogram is

266
00:15:10,630 --> 00:15:13,209
the same as the long side on the base so

267
00:15:13,209 --> 00:15:15,790
on the left-hand side you've got a short

268
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:18,220
length plus a long one on the right-hand

269
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:20,080
side you've got a long length plus a

270
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:23,260
short and so the two sides balance okay

271
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:25,240
I'll just show you the v-fold in

272
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:27,160
conjunction with the parallelogram this

273
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:30,040
book is jungle days by Helen bomber and

274
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:34,150
she's done a very imaginative use of the

275
00:15:34,150 --> 00:15:35,489
v-fold here

276
00:15:35,489 --> 00:15:38,319
this v-fold rather than it rising up

277
00:15:38,319 --> 00:15:40,029
from the base this is coming forward

278
00:15:40,029 --> 00:15:41,919
from the base so the surface of the

279
00:15:41,919 --> 00:15:44,709
water is made with a v-fold in this case

280
00:15:44,709 --> 00:15:47,289
all the other creatures the ducks the

281
00:15:47,289 --> 00:15:49,479
kids the dog they're all based on

282
00:15:49,479 --> 00:15:52,059
parallelograms lifted by the v-fold

283
00:15:52,059 --> 00:15:55,209
so if we look at it end on here you can

284
00:15:55,209 --> 00:15:57,669
see this there's parallelograms raised

285
00:15:57,669 --> 00:16:00,159
raised by the v-fold raised by the

286
00:16:00,159 --> 00:16:03,249
gulley here where the v-fold joins the

287
00:16:03,249 --> 00:16:05,289
page and it's the same on the other side

288
00:16:05,289 --> 00:16:08,499
you hear we got the dog and the and the

289
00:16:08,499 --> 00:16:08,919
kids

290
00:16:08,919 --> 00:16:11,199
these are parallelograms attached to the

291
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:14,409
v-fold so as the base closes as the

292
00:16:14,409 --> 00:16:16,749
parrot as the v-fold goes down so the

293
00:16:16,749 --> 00:16:23,769
parallelogram to close down the other

294
00:16:23,769 --> 00:16:25,659
use of the parallelogram is for moving

295
00:16:25,659 --> 00:16:28,809
arms so I'll just show you a quick way

296
00:16:28,809 --> 00:16:31,089
of doing that in actual fact moving arms

297
00:16:31,089 --> 00:16:34,119
is a highly complex aspect of pop up and

298
00:16:34,119 --> 00:16:35,979
there will be a whole tutorial on moving

299
00:16:35,979 --> 00:16:39,009
arms alone but it's an important use of

300
00:16:39,009 --> 00:16:41,379
the parallelogram so I've just shown you

301
00:16:41,379 --> 00:16:45,100
a quick basic way of doing it so here's

302
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:48,549
here's the base sheet and then we need a

303
00:16:48,549 --> 00:16:52,959
piece to pop up from it so here's a

304
00:16:52,959 --> 00:17:03,689
piece we just cut a chunk off the ends

305
00:17:03,689 --> 00:17:09,659
we'll just make that slightly shorter

306
00:17:09,659 --> 00:17:16,360
put tab on each ends these are parallel

307
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:22,720
folds with tab on each end and then trim

308
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:29,409
up the corners and in in this case

309
00:17:29,409 --> 00:17:32,649
there'll be a third fold but this this

310
00:17:32,649 --> 00:17:35,320
third fold keep it keep it quite near

311
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:37,840
the end so maybe you know one inch two

312
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:39,800
centimeters something like that

313
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:45,050
so make that third parallel fold fold it

314
00:17:45,050 --> 00:17:52,370
really really well and now you take this

315
00:17:52,370 --> 00:17:55,670
you fold it shut so this is this is font

316
00:17:55,670 --> 00:17:58,670
closed and you just fold down the top

317
00:17:58,670 --> 00:18:01,280
corner so you're folding this top edge

318
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:05,480
you close to close the parallelogram you

319
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:08,540
fold down this top edge to come down

320
00:18:08,540 --> 00:18:11,570
against the the crease so you've got

321
00:18:11,570 --> 00:18:15,320
that that little corner folded over and

322
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:17,900
this is actually a counter fold so you

323
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:20,720
can push that in and close it down so

324
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:23,000
there you are you've got the you've got

325
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:27,290
the counter fold now you put that this

326
00:18:27,290 --> 00:18:29,420
is going to glue onto the bottom of your

327
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:35,390
page so put the line up this this middle

328
00:18:35,390 --> 00:18:38,330
crease of the of the pop-up piece mark

329
00:18:38,330 --> 00:18:41,330
where they crease it the the short end

330
00:18:41,330 --> 00:18:45,370
lies on the page so you you just mark

331
00:18:45,370 --> 00:18:49,580
where that crease nice now crucial with

332
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:52,100
parallelograms you flip it over so

333
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:54,230
you're not going to stick though you're

334
00:18:54,230 --> 00:18:56,530
gonna stick the long ends to that mark

335
00:18:56,530 --> 00:18:59,870
make sure that make sure this double

336
00:18:59,870 --> 00:19:03,230
triangle is up because it's a

337
00:19:03,230 --> 00:19:05,300
parallelogram it goes flat when the base

338
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:07,700
is flat so you can put glue on both ends

339
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:15,230
at the same time smear the glue up to

340
00:19:15,230 --> 00:19:21,410
the crease

341
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:24,890
and you can glue that glue that down so

342
00:19:24,890 --> 00:19:27,140
you you measure the short distance but

343
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:29,360
you're gluing the long side too to the

344
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:32,390
mark and you can glue the other end at

345
00:19:32,390 --> 00:19:34,670
the same time with the whole piece flat

346
00:19:34,670 --> 00:19:38,570
so here it is the whole piece is flat as

347
00:19:38,570 --> 00:19:42,050
you as you close the page just make sure

348
00:19:42,050 --> 00:19:46,670
it all all works nicely and now you you

349
00:19:46,670 --> 00:19:51,500
can push that that counter fold in and

350
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:58,010
fold it shut right now you can attack

351
00:19:58,010 --> 00:19:59,960
I've made this ever so slightly rough

352
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:03,710
actually now you can take a piece to use

353
00:20:03,710 --> 00:20:07,270
as a moving of the cut this slightly

354
00:20:07,270 --> 00:20:15,740
slightly narrower this is going to stick

355
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:18,650
on to the small the triangle on the

356
00:20:18,650 --> 00:20:21,620
small side so we just cut that corner

357
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:26,900
off and stick this on to that on to that

358
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:36,530
triangle so this sticks down there and

359
00:20:36,530 --> 00:20:43,280
as the as the base closes I'm not sure

360
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:44,830
yeah that's fine

361
00:20:44,830 --> 00:20:49,400
as the base closes the the arm moves

362
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:51,950
down and you can actually enhance the

363
00:20:51,950 --> 00:20:57,470
visual effect if you if you put a elbow

364
00:20:57,470 --> 00:20:59,390
in the arm so if we stick an extra piece

365
00:20:59,390 --> 00:21:02,270
on there you'll get an impression of

366
00:21:02,270 --> 00:21:09,070
even more movement so glue that on there

367
00:21:09,070 --> 00:21:12,080
and now you've dropped the you've got

368
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:15,800
the moving on and there's a very good

369
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:18,170
example in the haunted house that I

370
00:21:18,170 --> 00:21:18,770
showed you

371
00:21:18,770 --> 00:21:23,480
oh yeah here's the haunted house and it

372
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:27,320
was on the third page here is it's the

373
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:29,120
parallelogram opening and

374
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:31,789
guerilla moves and it's actually really

375
00:21:31,789 --> 00:21:33,529
interesting if you look at these moving

376
00:21:33,529 --> 00:21:35,840
arms you've got the the triangle that's

377
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:37,580
on the short side of the parallelogram

378
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:39,379
and you've got the triangle on the long

379
00:21:39,379 --> 00:21:43,009
side this arm attached to the short side

380
00:21:43,009 --> 00:21:46,190
as the page closes it rotates against

381
00:21:46,190 --> 00:21:49,190
the page this arm attached to the long

382
00:21:49,190 --> 00:21:51,499
side of the parallelogram as the page

383
00:21:51,499 --> 00:21:54,440
closes it flips over so this is this is

384
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:56,870
quite important about moving arms moving

385
00:21:56,870 --> 00:21:58,879
arms a very sophisticated mechanism
动臂机制比较复杂

386
00:21:58,879 --> 00:22:01,369
there's a lot more to it you need to
