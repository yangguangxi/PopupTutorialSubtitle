2
00:00:40,149 --> 00:00:43,850
materials we'll be using a glue scissors

3
00:00:43,850 --> 00:00:47,630
and cart and details about all these

4
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:50,180
materials is explained more fully in the

5
00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:55,300
introductory tutorial so extra creases

6
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:59,000
this is a basic default with added

7
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,700
creases that create two more planes

8
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:04,640
which can be built extended and a gully

9
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:08,289
which can be built into this one is a

10
00:01:08,289 --> 00:01:10,880
parallel fold again we've got extra

11
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:12,920
creases which create another gully that

12
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:15,259
you can build into also creates extra

13
00:01:15,259 --> 00:01:20,179
planes that can be extended this one

14
00:01:20,179 --> 00:01:23,090
again this is a basic V fold and in this

15
00:01:23,090 --> 00:01:25,819
case the the extra creases rather than

16
00:01:25,819 --> 00:01:28,100
being used to create the gully like in

17
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:30,020
this one they've been trimmed down to

18
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:32,509
create two tabs and that's lifting at

19
00:01:32,509 --> 00:01:36,349
another whole pair of planes which again

20
00:01:36,349 --> 00:01:38,539
creates another gully that you can you

21
00:01:38,539 --> 00:01:41,029
can build on so let's just start by

22
00:01:41,029 --> 00:01:43,710
building one of these

23
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:46,690
[Music]

24
00:01:46,690 --> 00:01:52,960
so we take a base sheet fold it in half

25
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:56,690
no need to measure no need to score with

26
00:01:56,690 --> 00:02:00,770
this type of card this is 160 GSM

27
00:02:00,770 --> 00:02:03,170
photocopy card so it's really easy to

28
00:02:03,170 --> 00:02:05,509
fold just crease it really really

29
00:02:05,509 --> 00:02:08,209
thoroughly fold it back on itself a few

30
00:02:08,209 --> 00:02:14,300
times crimp it again and again that's

31
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:17,840
your base sheet now we'll take a another

32
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:25,519
piece of card to make the pop-up so we

33
00:02:25,519 --> 00:02:28,390
just take about a third of the card just

34
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:35,200
just by eye just roughly 2/3 of the card

35
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:41,750
fold it in half crease it really

36
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:47,269
thoroughly and then the v-fold you want

37
00:02:47,269 --> 00:02:50,540
to crease is coming up as an angle so we

38
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:53,030
start this is the folded line start

39
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:55,910
about half an inch above the base fold

40
00:02:55,910 --> 00:02:58,940
this up as an angle crease it really

41
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:05,090
well and fold it back on itself you can

42
00:03:05,090 --> 00:03:08,959
cut cut that corner out cut this to make

43
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:15,290
a couple of tabs trim off those corners

44
00:03:15,290 --> 00:03:18,010
just for neatness and so here we have

45
00:03:18,010 --> 00:03:22,780
the basic basic v-fold pop-up shape the

46
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:24,980
creases all make it downward pointing

47
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:28,400
arrow now you've got a choice we're

48
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,920
going to add two more creases basically

49
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:33,680
they they roughly follow the the line of

50
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,959
that one you can make it absolutely

51
00:03:35,959 --> 00:03:38,480
parallel or you can make it a bit coming

52
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,340
down a bit more steeply this is the

53
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:45,079
original fold so we fold it over crease

54
00:03:45,079 --> 00:03:49,880
it well fold it back on itself

55
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:52,550
open it up and now this will fold back

56
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:56,380
down so then we stick this onto the page

57
00:03:56,380 --> 00:03:59,180
this is what we're going to get and

58
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:01,760
again as we know very faulty can play

59
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:04,070
with the play with the angle of the

60
00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:06,440
piece on the page as you as you make it

61
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:08,270
tighter than the gully that you've

62
00:04:08,270 --> 00:04:11,600
created the extra gully folds points

63
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:14,120
back down law or as you go wider the

64
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:16,370
gully lifts up so you can play with the

65
00:04:16,370 --> 00:04:18,739
angles on these folds and it it affects

66
00:04:18,739 --> 00:04:21,380
the overall shape so we'll start by just

67
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:24,260
gluing this down I'll just cut these a

68
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:27,320
bit more a little sharper so they don't

69
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:30,800
overlap on the spine and so we've got

70
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:33,200
symmetry on the pop-up the angles

71
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:35,570
between the central crease and the

72
00:04:35,570 --> 00:04:37,490
creases on the viewing tabs they're both

73
00:04:37,490 --> 00:04:39,560
the same each side and now we want

74
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:42,380
symmetry on on the base and being a

75
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:44,090
v-fold this will fold down in the

76
00:04:44,090 --> 00:04:46,190
direction at the vias pointing so this

77
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:49,310
will fold down like this so to get the

78
00:04:49,310 --> 00:05:04,780
symmetry we just just glue one side

79
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:07,599
up near the up near the top of the page

80
00:05:07,599 --> 00:05:10,939
make sure the central central crease on

81
00:05:10,939 --> 00:05:13,719
the pop-up is aligned with the gulley

82
00:05:13,719 --> 00:05:17,360
glue it down so that's one side glued

83
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:21,259
down firmly moving nicely they can fold

84
00:05:21,259 --> 00:05:23,150
the whole piece into its closed position

85
00:05:23,150 --> 00:05:30,110
and put glue on the other tab smear the

86
00:05:30,110 --> 00:05:34,539
glue to the the up to the crease and

87
00:05:34,539 --> 00:05:43,250
then fold the page shut so here here we

88
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:45,680
have this this V fold now has an extra

89
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:48,349
gully created on top which you can build

90
00:05:48,349 --> 00:05:50,539
into or you can add on you may just

91
00:05:50,539 --> 00:05:54,169
choose to take some odd piece of card

92
00:05:54,169 --> 00:06:00,409
like this and you can just stick it on

93
00:06:00,409 --> 00:06:03,379
like this or like this or you know if I

94
00:06:03,379 --> 00:06:08,419
can fold it and you can glue that glue

95
00:06:08,419 --> 00:06:10,219
that into the gulley anywhere you like

96
00:06:10,219 --> 00:06:12,800
and you're starting to actually sculpt

97
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,870
with this shape so I'll just glue that

98
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:27,069
one in

99
00:06:27,069 --> 00:06:30,379
so I put it in and as you build with as

100
00:06:30,379 --> 00:06:32,779
you build with pop-ups every time you

101
00:06:32,779 --> 00:06:35,659
add a piece close the base and press it

102
00:06:35,659 --> 00:06:38,629
firmly so as you go step by step you're

103
00:06:38,629 --> 00:06:40,309
sure that the whole structure is sound

104
00:06:40,309 --> 00:06:43,309
to this but it's working that it fits in

105
00:06:43,309 --> 00:06:46,819
that the folds work that the gluing is

106
00:06:46,819 --> 00:06:49,249
working and this in this case we might

107
00:06:49,249 --> 00:06:51,740
as well just add another another little

108
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:55,520
them parallel fold on top of that so you

109
00:06:55,520 --> 00:07:00,399
can cutter cuts another piece of card

110
00:07:00,399 --> 00:07:11,740
fold it in half add a couple of tabs

111
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:19,459
trim them this is going to fit into that

112
00:07:19,459 --> 00:07:24,979
gully that we've just created so she's

113
00:07:24,979 --> 00:07:29,029
going to fit in like this so just put a

114
00:07:29,029 --> 00:07:33,499
bit of glue on on one tab smear it to

115
00:07:33,499 --> 00:07:36,349
the edges a little bit this is a

116
00:07:36,349 --> 00:07:38,599
parallel fold so it's got everything's

117
00:07:38,599 --> 00:07:41,180
got to be parallel with the crease in

118
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:46,729
the gully stick it into place put glue

119
00:07:46,729 --> 00:07:56,029
on the other tab smear the glue fold the

120
00:07:56,029 --> 00:07:58,189
whole piece shut so it finds its natural

121
00:07:58,189 --> 00:08:03,319
natural sticking position

122
00:08:03,319 --> 00:08:06,080
so here it is it's a basic very fold

123
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:08,719
with added creases which is then lifting

124
00:08:08,719 --> 00:08:10,659
up to more planes which has then got a

125
00:08:10,659 --> 00:08:13,219
parallel fold stuck into the top of it

126
00:08:13,219 --> 00:08:15,919
so you can you can look at this either

127
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:19,129
with a the pop up the base sheet is a

128
00:08:19,129 --> 00:08:21,830
base with the pop up rising from it or

129
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:23,539
you can look at it like this so this is

130
00:08:23,539 --> 00:08:25,249
the base sheet as a background did the

131
00:08:25,249 --> 00:08:27,649
pop up coming forward from it or we've

132
00:08:27,649 --> 00:08:29,960
made here is an abstract shape it's just

133
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:32,329
playing playing with the sculpture and

134
00:08:32,329 --> 00:08:34,550
again now you've actually from the

135
00:08:34,550 --> 00:08:36,829
original v-fold that was two planes

136
00:08:36,829 --> 00:08:39,409
you've now actually got six planes and

137
00:08:39,409 --> 00:08:42,829
so any of these can be expended you can

138
00:08:42,829 --> 00:08:45,019
come up off the blue one you can come up

139
00:08:45,019 --> 00:08:47,209
off the second gully where you can come

140
00:08:47,209 --> 00:08:50,319
up come off the of the parallel fold

141
00:08:50,319 --> 00:08:53,480
it's all just abstract at this point and

142
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:56,300
it's just yeah use your imagination see

143
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:59,899
where you want to go the other way you

144
00:08:59,899 --> 00:09:01,579
can play with this is that rather than

145
00:09:01,579 --> 00:09:05,089
creating two more planes with a Guddi

146
00:09:05,089 --> 00:09:11,569
you can create flaps so I just make one

147
00:09:11,569 --> 00:09:13,810
of those to show you how that works so

148
00:09:13,810 --> 00:09:17,380
take a piece of card fold it in half

149
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:19,959
crease it really well

150
00:09:19,959 --> 00:09:22,910
really crimp the creases fold them back

151
00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:29,740
on themselves crimp them again and again

152
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:32,660
so this this is your base sheet now

153
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:36,079
we'll build onto that it's a piece of

154
00:09:36,079 --> 00:09:39,949
card here we'll just take the piece of

155
00:09:39,949 --> 00:09:44,560
cards no measuring just cut it by eye

156
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:48,949
you know whatever size you want fold it

157
00:09:48,949 --> 00:09:54,680
in half crease it really well fold it

158
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:58,069
back on itself crimp it and again and

159
00:09:58,069 --> 00:10:01,189
then we're making a basic V fold so this

160
00:10:01,189 --> 00:10:03,620
is the fold line starting about half an

161
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:05,930
inch up you fold it up at an angle away

162
00:10:05,930 --> 00:10:09,050
from the away from the central fold fold

163
00:10:09,050 --> 00:10:12,949
it back on itself and you open this up

164
00:10:12,949 --> 00:10:14,750
you've got the basic V fold design

165
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:16,760
you've got the all the creases

166
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:19,370
make a downward pointing arrow so now

167
00:10:19,370 --> 00:10:22,210
we'll just trim that to make gluing tabs

168
00:10:22,210 --> 00:10:28,850
for the v-fold trim that a bit more

169
00:10:28,850 --> 00:10:32,630
sharp so it won't overlap and spine so

170
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:35,210
this is your basic V fold piece now

171
00:10:35,210 --> 00:10:38,810
let's make a fold at the top so come in

172
00:10:38,810 --> 00:10:41,810
like this this up this time I've got

173
00:10:41,810 --> 00:10:44,420
more or less parallel with the with the

174
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:46,610
original ones you can come in more or

175
00:10:46,610 --> 00:10:48,470
less at any angle whatever angle you

176
00:10:48,470 --> 00:10:50,810
come in at it'll affect the shape that

177
00:10:50,810 --> 00:10:52,850
you make but there's no right there's no

178
00:10:52,850 --> 00:10:55,580
wrong in this case I want the top to be

179
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:58,160
slightly narrower so I'm going to trim

180
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:01,160
this down coming from the corner I'm

181
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:04,970
going to cut in like that and then I'm

182
00:11:04,970 --> 00:11:10,270
going to trim these into two more tabs

183
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:13,400
so now we've got a v-fold with tabs at

184
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:18,080
the top so we fold fold fold down in the

185
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:20,000
direction they're pointing so we want

186
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,950
this to be up near the top of your page

187
00:11:21,950 --> 00:11:24,950
we've got symmetry so the two angles on

188
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:26,540
each side of the central fold are both

189
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:29,120
the same on this pop-up piece now we

190
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:32,780
want symmetry on the page so take the

191
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:35,180
glue just put glue on one tab to start

192
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:42,780
off with

193
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:44,970
right then work out whether you want a

194
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:47,520
really sharp shape or a wider one from

195
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:50,220
going up roughly 45 degrees but again it

196
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:52,590
doesn't matter it just depends depends

197
00:11:52,590 --> 00:11:54,800
what shape you want to create

198
00:11:54,800 --> 00:12:06,210
now put glue on the other tab and close

199
00:12:06,210 --> 00:12:17,310
it down so here we've got a v-fold with

200
00:12:17,310 --> 00:12:19,980
a pair of tabs on the top and you can

201
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:22,230
build into this so you take another

202
00:12:22,230 --> 00:12:24,780
piece fold it in half

203
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:27,720
I might actually prefer it long way so

204
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:36,860
no I fold it in half crease it well and

205
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:40,500
this piece where as in this one we made

206
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:43,200
before because you're working working

207
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:46,050
with a gully you can only make these

208
00:12:46,050 --> 00:12:49,620
pieces jut out that the angles created

209
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:53,130
by the gully in this case because you've

210
00:12:53,130 --> 00:12:55,170
got tabs you can actually see saris

211
00:12:55,170 --> 00:12:56,820
around so you may choose to have it

212
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:59,370
coming up really steep well you may

213
00:12:59,370 --> 00:13:01,589
choose to have it it can even be

214
00:13:01,589 --> 00:13:05,520
pointing down this way and the tabs will

215
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:08,310
stick onto it there so you can just see

216
00:13:08,310 --> 00:13:10,290
sorry to round and decide what shape you

217
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:12,660
want and then in this case you don't

218
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:14,850
glue one tab and then the other you put

219
00:13:14,850 --> 00:13:17,430
put glue on both tabs at the same time

220
00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:24,510
so put the glue on both the tabs smear

221
00:13:24,510 --> 00:13:31,290
it to the edges

222
00:13:31,290 --> 00:13:36,370
and decide what angle you want it um

223
00:13:36,370 --> 00:13:37,980
really I'm gonna go more or less

224
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:40,240
horizontal and you just fold the whole

225
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:50,260
piece down so there we have it and again

226
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:52,750
you can you can use this either as a

227
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:54,840
bass coming up looking at it like that

228
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:57,420
you might prefer to look at it like that

229
00:13:57,420 --> 00:14:00,370
you might even prefer to look at it like

230
00:14:00,370 --> 00:14:03,670
that or like that it's up to you and

231
00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:05,650
again you know you have actually got

232
00:14:05,650 --> 00:14:08,140
another gully it's not a very um it's

233
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:09,880
not a very deep one but you can build

234
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:12,610
into this or again you can just stop you

235
00:14:12,610 --> 00:14:14,650
know sticking extra pieces on that just

236
00:14:14,650 --> 00:14:16,990
out just ass all around it and make an

237
00:14:16,990 --> 00:14:20,290
interesting shade and so that that's all

238
00:14:20,290 --> 00:14:22,360
I'm going to show you in terms of making

239
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:26,280
things there's quite a nice one here

240
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:30,160
this is the same idea but this is a this

241
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:32,950
is a v-fold the red v-fold lifting up

242
00:14:32,950 --> 00:14:34,780
the Bluebirds so that's just like the

243
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:37,750
piece we just made I'll now show you

244
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:40,390
some some examples of extra creases in

245
00:14:40,390 --> 00:14:40,990
books

246
00:14:40,990 --> 00:14:44,170
so this one is championed Kowski

247
00:14:44,170 --> 00:14:47,590
dinnertime here's the FIR this is just

248
00:14:47,590 --> 00:14:51,820
an elementary pop-up this is a v-fold

249
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:54,550
with added creases so here you can see

250
00:14:54,550 --> 00:14:56,920
it's just a v-fold the whole thing will

251
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:59,020
just close and then with the added

252
00:14:59,020 --> 00:15:01,600
creases you get two more two more planes

253
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:05,440
created the same with the gorilla again

254
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:08,740
it's a v-fold closes down the added

255
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:11,650
creases make it you can pop it up and

256
00:15:11,650 --> 00:15:13,300
you get two more planes and a more

257
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:16,090
interesting sculptural shape same again

258
00:15:16,090 --> 00:15:20,290
here same again here the other book I'd

259
00:15:20,290 --> 00:15:22,480
like to show you this is some monster

260
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:25,510
Islands Monster Island Ron Vandermeer

261
00:15:25,510 --> 00:15:29,200
and here's a spread this is a basic

262
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:31,720
right angle v-folds but at the top we've

263
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:34,360
got added creases creating this

264
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:36,610
dimension up here this is just you can

265
00:15:36,610 --> 00:15:39,570
fold it down you can fold it down flat

266
00:15:39,570 --> 00:15:42,880
but by adding these extra creases

267
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,410
he's created a more interesting

268
00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:46,420
sculptural shape at the top of the

269
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:51,160
pop-up and then this one is this roaring

270
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:54,310
lion tails but Ron Vandermeer and this

271
00:15:54,310 --> 00:15:59,860
is a this is a parallel fold with extra

272
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:02,860
creases so if we pull this straight so

273
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:06,009
you can see this is just a very brand

274
00:16:06,009 --> 00:16:08,829
parallel fold the whole school just as

275
00:16:08,829 --> 00:16:11,230
fold flat and by adding these extra

276
00:16:11,230 --> 00:16:15,160
creases he's he sculpted the whole shape

277
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:17,949
and made it into a really solid 3d shape

278
00:16:17,949 --> 00:16:20,940
rather than just a sort of hollow tent

279
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:23,920
and then lastly I'd like to show you

280
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:28,389
this is robots by yen pien Kowski and

281
00:16:28,389 --> 00:16:31,509
the last spread in the book is this

282
00:16:31,509 --> 00:16:34,000
rocket rising from the clouds the cloud

283
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,230
is a basic parallel fold and the rocket

284
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:41,319
this is a belt onto a v-fold

285
00:16:41,319 --> 00:16:44,079
so here's a v-fold it's got added

286
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:47,079
creases that create this gully and the

287
00:16:47,079 --> 00:16:50,259
the rocket is a parallel fold built into

288
00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:53,110
the gully and the nose of rocket that's

289
00:16:53,110 --> 00:16:55,329
a mod modification that I'll show you in

290
00:16:55,329 --> 00:16:57,790
another another tutorial

291
00:16:57,790 --> 00:17:00,550
and so everything I've talked about in

292
00:17:00,550 --> 00:17:03,910
this tutorial is is covered in this my

293
00:17:03,910 --> 00:17:10,060
book pop-up design and paper mechanics

294
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:25,740
[Music]

295
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:37,670
[Applause]

296
00:17:37,670 --> 00:17:39,550
you

297
00:17:39,550 --> 00:17:42,660
[Music]
