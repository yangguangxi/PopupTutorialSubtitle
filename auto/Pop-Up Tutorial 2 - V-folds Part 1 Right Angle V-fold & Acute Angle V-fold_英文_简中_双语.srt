this tutorial is about V vaults one of
本教程是有关V Vault的

2
00:00:39,349 --> 00:00:39,359
this tutorial is about V vaults one of
弹出窗口中最重要的机制

3
00:00:39,359 --> 00:00:41,750
this tutorial is about V vaults one of
the most important mechanisms in pop-up
设计，所以我将从谈起

4
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:41,760
the most important mechanisms in pop-up
关于我们将要使用的材料

5
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:44,149
the most important mechanisms in pop-up
design and so I'll just start by talking
在本教程中使用，所以大多数

6
00:00:44,149 --> 00:00:44,159
design and so I'll just start by talking
重要的是这是160 GSM卡

7
00:00:44,159 --> 00:00:45,680
design and so I'll just start by talking
about the materials that we're going to
影印卡，您可以使用更重的

8
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:45,690
about the materials that we're going to
卡，甚至可以使用沉重的

9
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:48,469
about the materials that we're going to
be using in this tutorial so most
在这种情况下，墨盒纸为160 GSM

10
00:00:48,469 --> 00:00:48,479
be using in this tutorial so most
其他材料很粘

11
00:00:48,479 --> 00:00:51,979
be using in this tutorial so most
important is the card this is 160 GSM
重要的是最好的胶水是溶剂型

12
00:00:51,979 --> 00:00:51,989
important is the card this is 160 GSM
水性粘合剂会起作用，并且

13
00:00:51,989 --> 00:00:54,979
important is the card this is 160 GSM
photocopy card and you can use heavier
水基的问题会上升吗

14
00:00:54,979 --> 00:00:54,989
photocopy card and you can use heavier
速度较慢，因此很难使用

15
00:00:54,989 --> 00:00:57,489
photocopy card and you can use heavier
cards or you can even use heavy
而且它也倾向于扣卡

16
00:00:57,489 --> 00:00:57,499
cards or you can even use heavy
你不会得到如此令人满意的结果

17
00:00:57,499 --> 00:01:01,069
cards or you can even use heavy
cartridge paper in this case is 160 GSM
你也可以用胶水粘

18
00:01:01,069 --> 00:01:01,079
cartridge paper in this case is 160 GSM
胶水非常干净非常快速非常容易

19
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:04,130
cartridge paper in this case is 160 GSM
the other materials is glue very
为了制作粗糙的假人

20
00:01:04,130 --> 00:01:04,140
the other materials is glue very
绝对可以，但如果您弹出

21
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:07,550
the other materials is glue very
important the best glue is solvent based
你想持续很重要

22
00:01:07,550 --> 00:01:07,560
important the best glue is solvent based
给你粘胶往往会干裂

23
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:11,390
important the best glue is solvent based
adhesive water-based will work and the
然后你的弹出窗口会崩溃

24
00:01:11,390 --> 00:01:11,400
adhesive water-based will work and the
您需要的另一件事是

25
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,340
adhesive water-based will work and the
problem with water based is it goes up
剪刀，任何剪刀都会做卡胶

26
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:13,350
problem with water based is it goes up
剪刀就是您所需要的

27
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:15,590
problem with water based is it goes up
more slowly so it's harder to work with
教程以及大多数其他教程

28
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:15,600
more slowly so it's harder to work with
弹出窗口需要一个基础，因此我们从

29
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:18,050
more slowly so it's harder to work with
and it also tends to buckle the card so
只是将一张卡片对折

30
00:01:18,050 --> 00:01:18,060
and it also tends to buckle the card so
真的把它弄得很彻底

31
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:20,830
and it also tends to buckle the card so
you don't get so such pleasing results
过分强调对

32
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:20,840
you don't get so such pleasing results
折起卡片，然后将其折回

33
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:23,720
you don't get so such pleasing results
you can also use stick glue and stick
本身

34
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:23,730
you can also use stick glue and stick
再折一次，这是你的基础

35
00:01:23,730 --> 00:01:25,820
you can also use stick glue and stick
glue is very clean very quick very easy
有三个原则

36
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:25,830
glue is very clean very quick very easy
波普尔的第一个原则是

37
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:28,010
glue is very clean very quick very easy
and for making rough dummies it's
弹出窗口必须跨越一个沟渠，第一个

38
00:01:28,010 --> 00:01:28,020
and for making rough dummies it's
沟是脊椎向下折

39
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:31,100
and for making rough dummies it's
absolutely fine but if you make a pop-up
第二个原则是

40
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:31,110
absolutely fine but if you make a pop-up
每个弹出窗口都必须跨越一个沟壑

41
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:33,200
absolutely fine but if you make a pop-up
that you want to last that's important
必须固定在每一侧，

42
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:33,210
that you want to last that's important
必须在

43
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:35,960
that you want to last that's important
to you stick glue tends to dry out crack
沟渠，所以这里是沟渠

44
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:35,970
to you stick glue tends to dry out crack
V形褶皱就是我们在说的

45
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:37,840
to you stick glue tends to dry out crack
and then your pop ups will fall apart
关于本教程中的角度

46
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:37,850
and then your pop ups will fall apart
平衡，所以在弹出的角度

47
00:01:37,850 --> 00:01:40,370
and then your pop ups will fall apart
the other thing you need is a pair of
双方都是相同的

48
00:01:40,370 --> 00:01:40,380
the other thing you need is a pair of
每边的角度是

49
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:44,960
the other thing you need is a pair of
scissors any scissors will do card glue
同样的第三条原则是

50
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:44,970
scissors any scissors will do card glue
弹出窗口会创建沟壑，所以在这里我们有一个

51
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:47,090
scissors any scissors will do card glue
scissors that's all you need in this
弹出这是在

52
00:01:47,090 --> 00:01:47,100
scissors that's all you need in this
中间，这是一个平行四边形卡住

53
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:50,390
scissors that's all you need in this
tutorial and most of the others so all
进入它的弹出式窗口

54
00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:50,400
tutorial and most of the others so all
基本的沟口提高

55
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:53,180
tutorial and most of the others so all
pop ups need a base and so we start by
弹出，然后弹出Scully

56
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:53,190
pop ups need a base and so we start by
打开会弹出其中的弹出窗口，

57
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:55,660
pop ups need a base and so we start by
just folding a sheet of card in half
这是另一个例子，这又是

58
00:01:55,660 --> 00:01:55,670
just folding a sheet of card in half
这是另一个V形折叠，但在这种情况下

59
00:01:55,670 --> 00:01:58,430
just folding a sheet of card in half
crease it really thoroughly I can't
底孔打开沟壑凸起

60
00:01:58,430 --> 00:01:58,440
crease it really thoroughly I can't
弹出粉红色的位，这些

61
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:01,580
crease it really thoroughly I can't
overemphasize how important it is to to
两个平行四边形卡在

62
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:01,590
overemphasize how important it is to to
父亲创造的沟渠，所以

63
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:04,280
overemphasize how important it is to to
crease the card so fold it fold it back
每个弹出群众的三个原则

64
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:04,290
crease the card so fold it fold it back
Panigale每个弹出窗口必须保持平衡

65
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:04,970
crease the card so fold it fold it back
on itself
在沟渠的每一侧，每个弹出窗口

66
00:02:04,970 --> 00:02:04,980
on itself
创造出更多动力的沟壑

67
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:11,830
on itself
crease it again this is your base
可以卡住，所以这是三个

68


原理，所以现在我们继续

69
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,809
there is there are three principles in
实际v折

70
00:02:14,809 --> 00:02:14,819
there is there are three principles in
有五种V型折叠

71
00:02:14,819 --> 00:02:16,970
there is there are three principles in
popper the first principle is that every
第一个是直角

72
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:16,980
popper the first principle is that every
V形折叠，因此弹出窗口上的角度为

73
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:19,460
popper the first principle is that every
pop-up must span a gully and the first
都是90度，所以这是第一个

74
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:19,470
pop-up must span a gully and the first
这是第二个，这是急性的

75
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:21,740
pop-up must span a gully and the first
gully is the spine fold down the middle
v角折叠，因此每一侧的角度

76
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:21,750
gully is the spine fold down the middle
的沟渠都小于90度

77
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:26,030
gully is the spine fold down the middle
of the base the second principle is that
这是v型折叠的第二种类型

78
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:26,040
of the base the second principle is that
第三，这是尖锐的V型折叠

79
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:28,819
of the base the second principle is that
every pop-up must span a gully so it
锐角v折的变化

80
00:02:28,819 --> 00:02:28,829
every pop-up must span a gully so it
真的，但是顶端而不是顶端

81
00:02:28,829 --> 00:02:31,399
every pop-up must span a gully so it
must be stuck down on each side and it
站着自豪，这归结为打击

82
00:02:31,399 --> 00:02:31,409
must be stuck down on each side and it
这是v型折叠的第三种类型的页面

83
00:02:31,409 --> 00:02:33,259
must be stuck down on each side and it
must be balanced on each side of the
再次在每一侧的角度

84
00:02:33,259 --> 00:02:33,269
must be balanced on each side of the
中央折痕相同

85
00:02:33,269 --> 00:02:35,929
must be balanced on each side of the
gully so here's the gully in this case
折叠的类型

86
00:02:35,929 --> 00:02:35,939
gully so here's the gully in this case
这是默认的钝角

87
00:02:35,939 --> 00:02:37,819
gully so here's the gully in this case
with v-folds which is what we're talking
这一个在弹出的角度

88
00:02:37,819 --> 00:02:37,829
with v-folds which is what we're talking
中央折痕的每一边

89
00:02:37,829 --> 00:02:39,979
with v-folds which is what we're talking
about in this tutorial it's the angles
两者都超过90度

90
00:02:39,979 --> 00:02:39,989
about in this tutorial it's the angles
事情希腊默认，最后我们有

91
00:02:39,989 --> 00:02:43,009
about in this tutorial it's the angles
that balance so on the pop-up the angles
不对称的v-fold

92
00:02:43,009 --> 00:02:43,019
that balance so on the pop-up the angles
所以这个不对称的v-fold

93
00:02:43,019 --> 00:02:45,140
that balance so on the pop-up the angles
on each side are the same and on the
所有四个角度都不相同

94
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:45,150
on each side are the same and on the
弹出窗口上的角度不同

95
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:47,180
on each side are the same and on the
base the angles on each side are the
底座上的两个角度不同，但

96
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:47,190
base the angles on each side are the
仍然在左边的角度

97
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:50,809
base the angles on each side are the
same the third principle is that every
弹出框加上底边等于角度

98
00:02:50,809 --> 00:02:50,819
same the third principle is that every
在弹出窗口和底座的右侧

99
00:02:50,819 --> 00:02:53,449
same the third principle is that every
pop-up creates gullies so here we have a
所以我们又有了平衡

100
00:02:53,449 --> 00:02:53,459
pop-up creates gullies so here we have a
这是五折的五种类型

101
00:02:53,459 --> 00:02:56,479
pop-up creates gullies so here we have a
pop-up this is a gully created in the
在本教程中，我们只是与

102
00:02:56,479 --> 00:02:56,489
pop-up this is a gully created in the
这两个直角v-折和

103
00:02:56,489 --> 00:02:58,490
pop-up this is a gully created in the
middle and here's a parallelogram stuck
锐角v形折叠，所以我把这些

104
00:02:58,490 --> 00:02:58,500
middle and here's a parallelogram stuck
其他人走了以后

105
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:01,879
middle and here's a parallelogram stuck
into it so it's the pop-up rising the
教程

106
00:03:01,879 --> 00:03:01,889
into it so it's the pop-up rising the
因此，我们首先制作一个

107
00:03:01,889 --> 00:03:05,030
into it so it's the pop-up rising the
gully the basic gully opening raises the
直角v形折叠，所以我们取一个底

108
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:05,040
gully the basic gully opening raises the
折页完全折痕，然后

109
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,740
gully the basic gully opening raises the
pop-up and then the pop-up Scully
我们再拿一张纸牌

110
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:06,750
pop-up and then the pop-up Scully
制作实际的弹出窗口，让我们尝试一下粉红色

111
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:10,610
pop-up and then the pop-up Scully
opening raises the pop-up within it and
一块只是把它切成两半

112
00:03:10,610 --> 00:03:10,620
opening raises the pop-up within it and
眼睛其实并不重要

113
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:13,429
opening raises the pop-up within it and
here's another example this is again
将其折成两半

114
00:03:13,429 --> 00:03:13,439
here's another example this is again
折回去，所以我不能

115
00:03:13,439 --> 00:03:16,789
here's another example this is again
it's another v-fold but in this case the
过分强调它对

116
00:03:16,789 --> 00:03:16,799
it's another v-fold but in this case the
彻底折起所有褶皱

117
00:03:16,799 --> 00:03:21,409
it's another v-fold but in this case the
the base opening opens the gully raises
起伏，然后我们想要每个角度

118
00:03:21,409 --> 00:03:21,419
the base opening opens the gully raises
这边这将是你的

119
00:03:21,419 --> 00:03:23,960
the base opening opens the gully raises
the pop-up the pink bit and that these
弹出窗口像这样在您的

120
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:23,970
the pop-up the pink bit and that these
页面，因此我们需要每个角度

121
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:26,119
the pop-up the pink bit and that these
two parallelograms are stuck into the
边相等，所以在这种情况下我们折叠

122
00:03:26,119 --> 00:03:26,129
two parallelograms are stuck into the
它关闭并折叠一些折痕到

123
00:03:26,129 --> 00:03:28,430
two parallelograms are stuck into the
gullies created by the father so the
底部再折好

124
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:28,440
gullies created by the father so the
那你就必须切掉角落

125
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:31,039
gullies created by the father so the
three principles every pop-up mass
所以从那一点开始

126
00:03:31,039 --> 00:03:31,049
three principles every pop-up mass
收敛，你只是切出那个角度，

127
00:03:31,049 --> 00:03:33,589
three principles every pop-up mass
Panigale every pop-up must be balanced
剪掉那一点，所以你有了这些

128
00:03:33,589 --> 00:03:33,599
Panigale every pop-up must be balanced
现在将这种形状粘在标签上

129
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:35,839
Panigale every pop-up must be balanced
on each side of the gully every pop-up
你把那块切下来就可以折叠

130
00:03:35,839 --> 00:03:35,849
on each side of the gully every pop-up
这些都单独回来并弄皱

131
00:03:35,849 --> 00:03:37,819
on each side of the gully every pop-up
creates gullies which more power works
真的很彻底，就是那个

132
00:03:37,819 --> 00:03:37,829
creates gullies which more power works
这个还可以，所以我们弹出了

133
00:03:37,829 --> 00:03:39,860
creates gullies which more power works
can be stuck into so those are the three
件和每个侧面的角度是

134
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:39,870
can be stuck into so those are the three
匹配，所以我们知道我们有平衡

135
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:42,229
can be stuck into so those are the three
principles so now we move on to the
现在我们需要坚持下去

136
00:03:42,229 --> 00:03:42,239
principles so now we move on to the
这些V形折叠部分的分页方式

137
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:46,430
principles so now we move on to the
actual v-fold
向下，它们朝着

138


V指向，所以这个要走

139
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:50,220
there are five kinds of v-folds this is
以这种方式折叠下来，所以它需要

140
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:50,230
there are five kinds of v-folds this is
靠近你的前面

141
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:52,050
there are five kinds of v-folds this is
the first one this is the right angle
页面，然后贴上角度

142
00:03:52,050 --> 00:03:52,060
the first one this is the right angle
它对基地它可以是任何东西

143
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:54,600
the first one this is the right angle
v-fold so the angles on the pop-up are
你喜欢你可以有这样的形状

144
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:54,610
v-fold so the angles on the pop-up are
真的紧紧地靠在一起

145
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:58,100
v-fold so the angles on the pop-up are
both 90 degrees so that's the first one
或者您可以将它打开得更广泛

146
00:03:58,100 --> 00:03:58,110
both 90 degrees so that's the first one
可以像你想的那样宽

147
00:03:58,110 --> 00:04:00,720
both 90 degrees so that's the first one
this is the second one this is the acute
与脊柱成90度（如果是90度）

148
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:00,730
this is the second one this is the acute
度到

149
00:04:00,730 --> 00:04:03,150
this is the second one this is the acute
angle v-fold so the angles on each side
买整个东西会跌倒

150
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:03,160
angle v-fold so the angles on each side
向下，所以它必须小于90

151
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:05,330
angle v-fold so the angles on each side
of the gully both less than 90 degrees
在中央沟和它的位置之间

152
00:04:05,330 --> 00:04:05,340
of the gully both less than 90 degrees
粘合到页面和粘合方式

153
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:10,290
of the gully both less than 90 degrees
that's the the second type of v-fold the
这些只是通过粘贴一个标签开始，所以我们

154
00:04:10,290 --> 00:04:10,300
that's the the second type of v-fold the
在上面放一点胶

155
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:13,559
that's the the second type of v-fold the
third this is the pointy v-fold so it's
把它涂在右边

156
00:04:13,559 --> 00:04:13,569
third this is the pointy v-fold so it's
我用我的小手指的错，是

157
00:04:13,569 --> 00:04:15,720
third this is the pointy v-fold so it's
a variation on the acute angle v-fold
不要让胶水粘在我的另一只手上

158
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:15,730
a variation on the acute angle v-fold
其他手指，所以我仍然可以使用所有

159
00:04:15,730 --> 00:04:17,879
a variation on the acute angle v-fold
really but the the top rather than
其他手指也使东西排列整齐

160
00:04:17,879 --> 00:04:17,889
really but the the top rather than
弹出窗口的中央沟

161
00:04:17,889 --> 00:04:20,789
really but the the top rather than
standing proud it comes down to to hit
基部中央沟的那一点

162
00:04:20,789 --> 00:04:20,799
standing proud it comes down to to hit
放下并使其变得有趣

163
00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:23,010
standing proud it comes down to to hit
the page that's the third type of v-fold
你把胶水涂在另一个标签上

164
00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:23,020
the page that's the third type of v-fold
直到折痕边缘不是真的

165
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:25,200
the page that's the third type of v-fold
again the angles on each side of the

type of v-fold
this is the obtuse angle default so in
对建筑学科真的很好

172
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:32,110
this is the obtuse angle default so in
所以这是我做的一个

173
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:35,040
this is the obtuse angle default so in
this one the angles on the pop up on
是一个这是直角V折

174
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:35,050
this one the angles on the pop up on
养一个花园

175
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:36,810
this one the angles on the pop up on
each side of the central crease they're
平行四边形，所以这是第一个

176
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:36,820
each side of the central crease they're
平行四边形，它粘在这个沟渠中

177
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:39,510
each side of the central crease they're
both more than 90 degrees that's the two
的V折，这就是

178
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:39,520
both more than 90 degrees that's the two
第二个平行四边形粘贴到此

179
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:43,110
both more than 90 degrees that's the two
things Greek default and finally we have
沟渠

180
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:43,120
things Greek default and finally we have
所以当页面关闭整个

181
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,030
things Greek default and finally we have
the asymmetric v-fold
配置上升并掉落

182

the asymmetric v-fold
这本书罗恩的奇幻童话

183
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:48,990
the asymmetric v-fold
so is the asymmetric v-fold in this one
范德米尔

184
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:49,000
so is the asymmetric v-fold in this one
都是用这种直角制成的

185
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,600
so is the asymmetric v-fold in this one
all four angles are different the two
V折，所以如果我们略过

186
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:51,610
all four angles are different the two
第一个是V倍加注

187
00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:53,730
all four angles are different the two
angles on the pop-up are different the
这个平行四边形的房子到下一个

angles on the pop-up are different the
页面，在这种情况下是V形折叠

189
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:55,860
angles on the pop-up are different the
two angles on the base are different but
更开放

190
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:55,870
two angles on the base are different but
比以前的一遍又一遍

191
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:58,020
two angles on the base are different but
still the angles on the left on the
在这里有一个平行四边形

192
00:04:58,020 --> 00:04:58,030
still the angles on the left on the
平行四边形在这里粘到这个

193
00:04:58,030 --> 00:05:01,170
still the angles on the left on the
pop-up plus the base equals the angles
V型折页粘在页面上的沟

194
00:05:01,170 --> 00:05:01,180
pop-up plus the base equals the angles
这是第三个，这是一个

then you have to cut out the the corner
指向页面，以便您打开

248
00:06:30,929 --> 00:06:30,939
then you have to cut out the the corner
仙女从书中掉出来的那一页

249
00:06:30,939 --> 00:06:33,809
then you have to cut out the the corner
so from that point where the the creases
当您关闭页面时，它们非常

250
00:06:33,809 --> 00:06:33,819
so from that point where the the creases
你知道跳回书中

251
00:06:33,819 --> 00:06:36,119
so from that point where the the creases
converge you just cut out that angle and
这是一个非常令人愉快的使用

252
00:06:36,119 --> 00:06:36,129
converge you just cut out that angle and
您知道的那种设计以及

253
00:06:36,129 --> 00:06:39,199
converge you just cut out that angle and
and cut off that bit so you've got these

you've cut that piece out you can fold
将其折半

258
00:06:44,249 --> 00:06:44,259
you've cut that piece out you can fold
一次又一次在这里

259
00:06:44,259 --> 00:06:46,529
you've cut that piece out you can fold
these back individually and crease them
我们将使我们的作品

260
00:06:46,529 --> 00:06:46,539
these back individually and crease them
将其折叠起来

261
00:06:46,539 --> 00:06:54,629
these back individually and crease them
really thoroughly so that's that one and
将其折好一半然后

262
00:06:54,629 --> 00:06:54,639
really thoroughly so that's that one and
而以直角V折，我们

263
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:57,269
really thoroughly so that's that one and
this one okay so we've got our pop-up

this one okay so we've got our pop-up
在这种情况下的底部边缘

265
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:59,909
this one okay so we've got our pop-up
piece and the angles each side that are
把它折成一个角度

266
00:06:59,909 --> 00:06:59,919
piece and the angles each side that are

267
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:02,249
piece and the angles each side that are
matching so we know we've got balance
角落，这是折叠的一面

268
00:07:02,249 --> 00:07:02,259
matching so we know we've got balance
向上倾斜，并且您折叠的角度是

269
00:07:02,259 --> 00:07:04,499
