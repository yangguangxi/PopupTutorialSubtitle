00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:39,349
this tutorial is about V vaults one of

2
00:00:39,349 --> 00:00:39,359
this tutorial is about V vaults one of

3
00:00:39,359 --> 00:00:41,750
this tutorial is about V vaults one of
the most important mechanisms in pop-up

4
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:41,760
the most important mechanisms in pop-up

5
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:44,149
the most important mechanisms in pop-up
design and so I'll just start by talking

6
00:00:44,149 --> 00:00:44,159
design and so I'll just start by talking

7
00:00:44,159 --> 00:00:45,680
design and so I'll just start by talking
about the materials that we're going to

8
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:45,690
about the materials that we're going to

9
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:48,469
about the materials that we're going to
be using in this tutorial so most

10
00:00:48,469 --> 00:00:48,479
be using in this tutorial so most

11
00:00:48,479 --> 00:00:51,979
be using in this tutorial so most
important is the card this is 160 GSM

12
00:00:51,979 --> 00:00:51,989
important is the card this is 160 GSM

13
00:00:51,989 --> 00:00:54,979
important is the card this is 160 GSM
photocopy card and you can use heavier

14
00:00:54,979 --> 00:00:54,989
photocopy card and you can use heavier

15
00:00:54,989 --> 00:00:57,489
photocopy card and you can use heavier
cards or you can even use heavy

16
00:00:57,489 --> 00:00:57,499
cards or you can even use heavy

17
00:00:57,499 --> 00:01:01,069
cards or you can even use heavy
cartridge paper in this case is 160 GSM

18
00:01:01,069 --> 00:01:01,079
cartridge paper in this case is 160 GSM

19
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:04,130
cartridge paper in this case is 160 GSM
the other materials is glue very

20
00:01:04,130 --> 00:01:04,140
the other materials is glue very

21
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:07,550
the other materials is glue very
important the best glue is solvent based

22
00:01:07,550 --> 00:01:07,560
important the best glue is solvent based

23
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:11,390
important the best glue is solvent based
adhesive water-based will work and the

24
00:01:11,390 --> 00:01:11,400
adhesive water-based will work and the

25
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,340
adhesive water-based will work and the
problem with water based is it goes up

26
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:13,350
problem with water based is it goes up

27
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:15,590
problem with water based is it goes up
more slowly so it's harder to work with

28
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:15,600
more slowly so it's harder to work with

29
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:18,050
more slowly so it's harder to work with
and it also tends to buckle the card so

30
00:01:18,050 --> 00:01:18,060
and it also tends to buckle the card so

31
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:20,830
and it also tends to buckle the card so
you don't get so such pleasing results

32
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:20,840
you don't get so such pleasing results

33
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:23,720
you don't get so such pleasing results
you can also use stick glue and stick

34
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:23,730
you can also use stick glue and stick

35
00:01:23,730 --> 00:01:25,820
you can also use stick glue and stick
glue is very clean very quick very easy

36
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:25,830
glue is very clean very quick very easy

37
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:28,010
glue is very clean very quick very easy
and for making rough dummies it's

38
00:01:28,010 --> 00:01:28,020
and for making rough dummies it's

39
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:31,100
and for making rough dummies it's
absolutely fine but if you make a pop-up

40
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:31,110
absolutely fine but if you make a pop-up

41
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:33,200
absolutely fine but if you make a pop-up
that you want to last that's important

42
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:33,210
that you want to last that's important

43
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:35,960
that you want to last that's important
to you stick glue tends to dry out crack

44
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:35,970
to you stick glue tends to dry out crack

45
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:37,840
to you stick glue tends to dry out crack
and then your pop ups will fall apart

46
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:37,850
and then your pop ups will fall apart

47
00:01:37,850 --> 00:01:40,370
and then your pop ups will fall apart
the other thing you need is a pair of

48
00:01:40,370 --> 00:01:40,380
the other thing you need is a pair of

49
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:44,960
the other thing you need is a pair of
scissors any scissors will do card glue

50
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:44,970
scissors any scissors will do card glue

51
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:47,090
scissors any scissors will do card glue
scissors that's all you need in this

52
00:01:47,090 --> 00:01:47,100
scissors that's all you need in this

53
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:50,390
scissors that's all you need in this
tutorial and most of the others so all

54
00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:50,400
tutorial and most of the others so all

55
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:53,180
tutorial and most of the others so all
pop ups need a base and so we start by

56
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:53,190
pop ups need a base and so we start by

57
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:55,660
pop ups need a base and so we start by
just folding a sheet of card in half

58
00:01:55,660 --> 00:01:55,670
just folding a sheet of card in half

59
00:01:55,670 --> 00:01:58,430
just folding a sheet of card in half
crease it really thoroughly I can't

60
00:01:58,430 --> 00:01:58,440
crease it really thoroughly I can't

61
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:01,580
crease it really thoroughly I can't
overemphasize how important it is to to

62
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:01,590
overemphasize how important it is to to

63
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:04,280
overemphasize how important it is to to
crease the card so fold it fold it back

64
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:04,290
crease the card so fold it fold it back

65
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:04,970
crease the card so fold it fold it back
on itself

66
00:02:04,970 --> 00:02:04,980
on itself

67
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:11,830
on itself
crease it again this is your base

68
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:11,840


69
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,809
there is there are three principles in

70
00:02:14,809 --> 00:02:14,819
there is there are three principles in

71
00:02:14,819 --> 00:02:16,970
there is there are three principles in
popper the first principle is that every

72
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:16,980
popper the first principle is that every

73
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:19,460
popper the first principle is that every
pop-up must span a gully and the first

74
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:19,470
pop-up must span a gully and the first

75
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:21,740
pop-up must span a gully and the first
gully is the spine fold down the middle

76
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:21,750
gully is the spine fold down the middle

77
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:26,030
gully is the spine fold down the middle
of the base the second principle is that

78
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:26,040
of the base the second principle is that

79
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:28,819
of the base the second principle is that
every pop-up must span a gully so it

80
00:02:28,819 --> 00:02:28,829
every pop-up must span a gully so it

81
00:02:28,829 --> 00:02:31,399
every pop-up must span a gully so it
must be stuck down on each side and it

82
00:02:31,399 --> 00:02:31,409
must be stuck down on each side and it

83
00:02:31,409 --> 00:02:33,259
must be stuck down on each side and it
must be balanced on each side of the

84
00:02:33,259 --> 00:02:33,269
must be balanced on each side of the

85
00:02:33,269 --> 00:02:35,929
must be balanced on each side of the
gully so here's the gully in this case

86
00:02:35,929 --> 00:02:35,939
gully so here's the gully in this case

87
00:02:35,939 --> 00:02:37,819
gully so here's the gully in this case
with v-folds which is what we're talking

88
00:02:37,819 --> 00:02:37,829
with v-folds which is what we're talking

89
00:02:37,829 --> 00:02:39,979
with v-folds which is what we're talking
about in this tutorial it's the angles

90
00:02:39,979 --> 00:02:39,989
about in this tutorial it's the angles

91
00:02:39,989 --> 00:02:43,009
about in this tutorial it's the angles
that balance so on the pop-up the angles

92
00:02:43,009 --> 00:02:43,019
that balance so on the pop-up the angles

93
00:02:43,019 --> 00:02:45,140
that balance so on the pop-up the angles
on each side are the same and on the

94
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:45,150
on each side are the same and on the

95
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:47,180
on each side are the same and on the
base the angles on each side are the

96
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:47,190
base the angles on each side are the

97
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:50,809
base the angles on each side are the
same the third principle is that every

98
00:02:50,809 --> 00:02:50,819
same the third principle is that every

99
00:02:50,819 --> 00:02:53,449
same the third principle is that every
pop-up creates gullies so here we have a

100
00:02:53,449 --> 00:02:53,459
pop-up creates gullies so here we have a

101
00:02:53,459 --> 00:02:56,479
pop-up creates gullies so here we have a
pop-up this is a gully created in the

102
00:02:56,479 --> 00:02:56,489
pop-up this is a gully created in the

103
00:02:56,489 --> 00:02:58,490
pop-up this is a gully created in the
middle and here's a parallelogram stuck

104
00:02:58,490 --> 00:02:58,500
middle and here's a parallelogram stuck

105
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:01,879
middle and here's a parallelogram stuck
into it so it's the pop-up rising the

106
00:03:01,879 --> 00:03:01,889
into it so it's the pop-up rising the

107
00:03:01,889 --> 00:03:05,030
into it so it's the pop-up rising the
gully the basic gully opening raises the

108
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:05,040
gully the basic gully opening raises the

109
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,740
gully the basic gully opening raises the
pop-up and then the pop-up Scully

110
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:06,750
pop-up and then the pop-up Scully

111
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:10,610
pop-up and then the pop-up Scully
opening raises the pop-up within it and

112
00:03:10,610 --> 00:03:10,620
opening raises the pop-up within it and

113
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:13,429
opening raises the pop-up within it and
here's another example this is again

114
00:03:13,429 --> 00:03:13,439
here's another example this is again

115
00:03:13,439 --> 00:03:16,789
here's another example this is again
it's another v-fold but in this case the

116
00:03:16,789 --> 00:03:16,799
it's another v-fold but in this case the

117
00:03:16,799 --> 00:03:21,409
it's another v-fold but in this case the
the base opening opens the gully raises

118
00:03:21,409 --> 00:03:21,419
the base opening opens the gully raises

119
00:03:21,419 --> 00:03:23,960
the base opening opens the gully raises
the pop-up the pink bit and that these

120
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:23,970
the pop-up the pink bit and that these

121
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:26,119
the pop-up the pink bit and that these
two parallelograms are stuck into the

122
00:03:26,119 --> 00:03:26,129
two parallelograms are stuck into the

123
00:03:26,129 --> 00:03:28,430
two parallelograms are stuck into the
gullies created by the father so the

124
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:28,440
gullies created by the father so the

125
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:31,039
gullies created by the father so the
three principles every pop-up mass

126
00:03:31,039 --> 00:03:31,049
three principles every pop-up mass

127
00:03:31,049 --> 00:03:33,589
three principles every pop-up mass
Panigale every pop-up must be balanced

128
00:03:33,589 --> 00:03:33,599
Panigale every pop-up must be balanced

129
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:35,839
Panigale every pop-up must be balanced
on each side of the gully every pop-up

130
00:03:35,839 --> 00:03:35,849
on each side of the gully every pop-up

131
00:03:35,849 --> 00:03:37,819
on each side of the gully every pop-up
creates gullies which more power works

132
00:03:37,819 --> 00:03:37,829
creates gullies which more power works

133
00:03:37,829 --> 00:03:39,860
creates gullies which more power works
can be stuck into so those are the three

134
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:39,870
can be stuck into so those are the three

135
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:42,229
can be stuck into so those are the three
principles so now we move on to the

136
00:03:42,229 --> 00:03:42,239
principles so now we move on to the

137
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:46,430
principles so now we move on to the
actual v-fold

138
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:46,440


139
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:50,220
there are five kinds of v-folds this is

140
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:50,230
there are five kinds of v-folds this is

141
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:52,050
there are five kinds of v-folds this is
the first one this is the right angle

142
00:03:52,050 --> 00:03:52,060
the first one this is the right angle

143
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:54,600
the first one this is the right angle
v-fold so the angles on the pop-up are

144
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:54,610
v-fold so the angles on the pop-up are

145
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:58,100
v-fold so the angles on the pop-up are
both 90 degrees so that's the first one

146
00:03:58,100 --> 00:03:58,110
both 90 degrees so that's the first one

147
00:03:58,110 --> 00:04:00,720
both 90 degrees so that's the first one
this is the second one this is the acute

148
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:00,730
this is the second one this is the acute

149
00:04:00,730 --> 00:04:03,150
this is the second one this is the acute
angle v-fold so the angles on each side

150
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:03,160
angle v-fold so the angles on each side

151
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:05,330
angle v-fold so the angles on each side
of the gully both less than 90 degrees

152
00:04:05,330 --> 00:04:05,340
of the gully both less than 90 degrees

153
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:10,290
of the gully both less than 90 degrees
that's the the second type of v-fold the

154
00:04:10,290 --> 00:04:10,300
that's the the second type of v-fold the

155
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:13,559
that's the the second type of v-fold the
third this is the pointy v-fold so it's

156
00:04:13,559 --> 00:04:13,569
third this is the pointy v-fold so it's

157
00:04:13,569 --> 00:04:15,720
third this is the pointy v-fold so it's
a variation on the acute angle v-fold

158
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:15,730
a variation on the acute angle v-fold

159
00:04:15,730 --> 00:04:17,879
a variation on the acute angle v-fold
really but the the top rather than

00:04:20,789 --> 00:04:20,799
standing proud it comes down to to hit

163
00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:23,010
standing proud it comes down to to hit
the page that's the third type of v-fold

164
00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:23,020
the page that's the third type of v-fold

165
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:25,200
the page that's the third type of v-fold
again the angles on each side of the

166
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:25,210
again the angles on each side of the

167
00:04:25,210 --> 00:04:28,560
again the angles on each side of the
central crease are the same the fourth

168
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:28,570
central crease are the same the fourth

169
00:04:28,570 --> 00:04:29,640
central crease are the same the fourth
type of v-fold

170
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:29,650
type of v-fold

171
00:04:29,650 --> 00:04:32,100
type of v-fold
this is the obtuse angle default so in

172
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:32,110
this is the obtuse angle default so in

173
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:35,040
this is the obtuse angle default so in
this one the angles on the pop up on

174
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:35,050
this one the angles on the pop up on

175
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:36,810
this one the angles on the pop up on
each side of the central crease they're

176
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:36,820
each side of the central crease they're

177
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:39,510
each side of the central crease they're
both more than 90 degrees that's the two

178
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:39,520
both more than 90 degrees that's the two

179
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:43,110
both more than 90 degrees that's the two
things Greek default and finally we have

180
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:43,120
things Greek default and finally we have

181
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,030
things Greek default and finally we have
the asymmetric v-fold

182
00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:45,040
the asymmetric v-fold

183
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:48,990
the asymmetric v-fold
so is the asymmetric v-fold in this one

184
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:49,000
so is the asymmetric v-fold in this one

185
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,600
so is the asymmetric v-fold in this one
all four angles are different the two

186
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:51,610
all four angles are different the two

187
00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:53,730
all four angles are different the two
angles on the pop-up are different the

188
00:04:53,730 --> 00:04:53,740
angles on the pop-up are different the

189
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:55,860
angles on the pop-up are different the
two angles on the base are different but

190
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:55,870
two angles on the base are different but

191
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:58,020
two angles on the base are different but
still the angles on the left on the

192
00:04:58,020 --> 00:04:58,030
still the angles on the left on the

193
00:04:58,030 --> 00:05:01,170
still the angles on the left on the
pop-up plus the base equals the angles

194
00:05:01,170 --> 00:05:01,180
pop-up plus the base equals the angles

195
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:03,029
pop-up plus the base equals the angles
on the right on the pop-up and the base

196
00:05:03,029 --> 00:05:03,039
on the right on the pop-up and the base

197
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:06,150
on the right on the pop-up and the base
so again we've got we've got balance so

198
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:06,160
so again we've got we've got balance so

199
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,550
so again we've got we've got balance so
those are the five types of v-fold

200
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:08,560
those are the five types of v-fold

201
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:11,400
those are the five types of v-fold
in this tutorial we're just working with

202
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:11,410
in this tutorial we're just working with

203
00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:13,350
in this tutorial we're just working with
these two the right angle v-folds and

204
00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:13,360
these two the right angle v-folds and

205
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:16,529
these two the right angle v-folds and
the acute angle v-fold so i put these

206
00:05:16,529 --> 00:05:16,539
the acute angle v-fold so i put these

207
00:05:16,539 --> 00:05:18,900
the acute angle v-fold so i put these
other ones away they come up in a later

208
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:18,910
other ones away they come up in a later

209
00:05:18,910 --> 00:05:24,679
other ones away they come up in a later
tutorial

210
00:05:24,679 --> 00:05:24,689


211
00:05:24,689 --> 00:05:27,319
so we start by making one we'll make a

212
00:05:27,319 --> 00:05:27,329
so we start by making one we'll make a

213
00:05:27,329 --> 00:05:30,839
so we start by making one we'll make a
right-angle v-folds so we take a base

214
00:05:30,839 --> 00:05:30,849
right-angle v-folds so we take a base

215
00:05:30,849 --> 00:05:35,489
right-angle v-folds so we take a base
sheet folded thoroughly creased and then

216
00:05:35,489 --> 00:05:35,499
sheet folded thoroughly creased and then

217
00:05:35,499 --> 00:05:37,229
sheet folded thoroughly creased and then
we'll take another sheet of cards to

218
00:05:37,229 --> 00:05:37,239
we'll take another sheet of cards to

219
00:05:37,239 --> 00:05:40,829
we'll take another sheet of cards to
make the actual pop-up let's try a pink

220
00:05:40,829 --> 00:05:40,839
make the actual pop-up let's try a pink

221
00:05:40,839 --> 00:05:45,539
make the actual pop-up let's try a pink
piece here just just cut it in half by

222
00:05:45,539 --> 00:05:45,549
piece here just just cut it in half by

223
00:05:45,549 --> 00:05:52,579
piece here just just cut it in half by
eye doesn't really doesn't really matter

224
00:05:52,579 --> 00:05:52,589


225
00:05:52,589 --> 00:05:58,729
fold it in half crease it thoroughly

226
00:05:58,729 --> 00:05:58,739
fold it in half crease it thoroughly

227
00:05:58,739 --> 00:06:01,769
fold it in half crease it thoroughly
fold it back on it so I can't

228
00:06:01,769 --> 00:06:01,779
fold it back on it so I can't

229
00:06:01,779 --> 00:06:03,899
fold it back on it so I can't
overemphasize how important it is to

230
00:06:03,899 --> 00:06:03,909
overemphasize how important it is to

231
00:06:03,909 --> 00:06:07,259
overemphasize how important it is to
thoroughly crease all the folds on pop

232
00:06:07,259 --> 00:06:07,269
thoroughly crease all the folds on pop

233
00:06:07,269 --> 00:06:09,959
thoroughly crease all the folds on pop
ups and then we want the angles on each

234
00:06:09,959 --> 00:06:09,969
ups and then we want the angles on each

235
00:06:09,969 --> 00:06:11,969
ups and then we want the angles on each
side this is this is going to be your

236
00:06:11,969 --> 00:06:11,979
side this is this is going to be your

237
00:06:11,979 --> 00:06:14,159
side this is this is going to be your
pop-up standing up like this on your

238
00:06:14,159 --> 00:06:14,169
pop-up standing up like this on your

239
00:06:14,169 --> 00:06:16,979
pop-up standing up like this on your
page and so we need the angles on each

240
00:06:16,979 --> 00:06:16,989
page and so we need the angles on each

241
00:06:16,989 --> 00:06:19,319
page and so we need the angles on each
side to be equal so in this case we fold

242
00:06:19,319 --> 00:06:19,329
side to be equal so in this case we fold

243
00:06:19,329 --> 00:06:21,869
side to be equal so in this case we fold
it shut and fold some creases onto the

244
00:06:21,869 --> 00:06:21,879
it shut and fold some creases onto the

245
00:06:21,879 --> 00:06:28,559
it shut and fold some creases onto the
bottom and again crease them well and

246
00:06:28,559 --> 00:06:28,569
bottom and again crease them well and

247
00:06:28,569 --> 00:06:30,929
bottom and again crease them well and
then you have to cut out the the corner

248
00:06:30,929 --> 00:06:30,939
then you have to cut out the the corner

249
00:06:30,939 --> 00:06:33,809
then you have to cut out the the corner
so from that point where the the creases

250
00:06:33,809 --> 00:06:33,819
so from that point where the the creases

251
00:06:33,819 --> 00:06:36,119
so from that point where the the creases
converge you just cut out that angle and

252
00:06:36,119 --> 00:06:36,129
converge you just cut out that angle and

253
00:06:36,129 --> 00:06:39,199
converge you just cut out that angle and
and cut off that bit so you've got these

254
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:39,209
and cut off that bit so you've got these

255
00:06:39,209 --> 00:06:42,600
and cut off that bit so you've got these
gluing tabs this shape and now now

256
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:42,610
gluing tabs this shape and now now

257
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:44,249
gluing tabs this shape and now now
you've cut that piece out you can fold

258
00:06:44,249 --> 00:06:44,259
you've cut that piece out you can fold

259
00:06:44,259 --> 00:06:46,529
you've cut that piece out you can fold
these back individually and crease them

260
00:06:46,529 --> 00:06:46,539
these back individually and crease them

261
00:06:46,539 --> 00:06:54,629
these back individually and crease them
really thoroughly so that's that one and

262
00:06:54,629 --> 00:06:54,639
really thoroughly so that's that one and

263
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:57,269
really thoroughly so that's that one and
this one okay so we've got our pop-up

264
00:06:57,269 --> 00:06:57,279
this one okay so we've got our pop-up

265
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:59,909
this one okay so we've got our pop-up
piece and the angles each side that are

266
00:06:59,909 --> 00:06:59,919
piece and the angles each side that are

267
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:02,249
piece and the angles each side that are
matching so we know we've got balance

268
00:07:02,249 --> 00:07:02,259
matching so we know we've got balance

269
00:07:02,259 --> 00:07:04,499
matching so we know we've got balance
there now we need to stick it to the

270
00:07:04,499 --> 00:07:04,509
there now we need to stick it to the

271
00:07:04,509 --> 00:07:08,699
there now we need to stick it to the
page the way part these V folds fold

272
00:07:08,699 --> 00:07:08,709
page the way part these V folds fold

273
00:07:08,709 --> 00:07:10,739
page the way part these V folds fold
down they fold down in the direction at

274
00:07:10,739 --> 00:07:10,749
down they fold down in the direction at

275
00:07:10,749 --> 00:07:13,469
down they fold down in the direction at
the V is pointing so this one is going

276
00:07:13,469 --> 00:07:13,479
the V is pointing so this one is going

277
00:07:13,479 --> 00:07:15,569
the V is pointing so this one is going
to fold down this way so it needs to be

278
00:07:15,569 --> 00:07:15,579
to fold down this way so it needs to be

279
00:07:15,579 --> 00:07:17,759
to fold down this way so it needs to be
near the front of your front of your

280
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:17,769
near the front of your front of your

281
00:07:17,769 --> 00:07:20,549
near the front of your front of your
page and then the angle that you stick

282
00:07:20,549 --> 00:07:20,559
page and then the angle that you stick

283
00:07:20,559 --> 00:07:23,729
page and then the angle that you stick
it to the to the base it can be anything

284
00:07:23,729 --> 00:07:23,739
it to the to the base it can be anything

285
00:07:23,739 --> 00:07:25,499
it to the to the base it can be anything
you like you can have a shape like this

286
00:07:25,499 --> 00:07:25,509
you like you can have a shape like this

287
00:07:25,509 --> 00:07:28,499
you like you can have a shape like this
where it's really tight close together

288
00:07:28,499 --> 00:07:28,509
where it's really tight close together

289
00:07:28,509 --> 00:07:31,409
where it's really tight close together
or you can open it up wide and wider you

290
00:07:31,409 --> 00:07:31,419
or you can open it up wide and wider you

291
00:07:31,419 --> 00:07:34,259
or you can open it up wide and wider you
can go as wide as you like it mustn't be

292
00:07:34,259 --> 00:07:34,269
can go as wide as you like it mustn't be

293
00:07:34,269 --> 00:07:36,329
can go as wide as you like it mustn't be
at 90 degrees to the spine if it's 90

294
00:07:36,329 --> 00:07:36,339
at 90 degrees to the spine if it's 90

295
00:07:36,339 --> 00:07:37,110
at 90 degrees to the spine if it's 90
degrees to the

buying the whole thing can just fall

298
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:38,530
buying the whole thing can just fall

299
00:07:38,530 --> 00:07:41,010
buying the whole thing can just fall
down so it's got to be less than 90

300
00:07:41,010 --> 00:07:41,020
down so it's got to be less than 90

301
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:44,159
down so it's got to be less than 90
between the central gully and where it's

00:07:44,159 --> 00:07:44,169
between the central gully and where it's

303
00:07:44,169 --> 00:07:46,740
between the central gully and where it's
gluing to the page and the way you glue

304
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:46,750
gluing to the page and the way you glue

305
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:55,620
gluing to the page and the way you glue
these just start by gluing one tab so we

306
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:55,630
these just start by gluing one tab so we

307
00:07:55,630 --> 00:08:02,120
these just start by gluing one tab so we
put put a bit of glue on it

308
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:02,130
put put a bit of glue on it

309
00:08:02,130 --> 00:08:06,659
put put a bit of glue on it
smear it right to the right to the to

that way the fact that the page isn't

430
00:10:59,129 --> 00:10:59,139
that way the fact that the page isn't

431
00:10:59,139 --> 00:11:01,559
that way the fact that the page isn't
completely flat doesn't matter visually

432

completely flat doesn't matter visually

433
00:11:01,569 --> 00:11:03,600
completely flat doesn't matter visually
but if you look at it the other way

434
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:03,610
but if you look at it the other way

435
00:11:03,610 --> 00:11:05,939
but if you look at it the other way
around so you're looking into the

436
00:11:05,939 --> 00:11:05,949
around so you're looking into the

437
00:11:05,949 --> 00:11:08,160
around so you're looking into the
mountain fold of it if the page isn't

438
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:08,170
mountain fold of it if the page isn't

439
00:11:08,170 --> 00:11:10,439

absolutely flat the whole thing sags

441
00:11:10,449 --> 00:11:13,170
absolutely flat the whole thing sags
towards you so that might be what you

442
00:11:13,170 --> 00:11:13,180
towards you so that might be what you

443
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:15,269
towards you so that might be what you
want is part of your design but

Fletcher lovely book here's a fairy made

488
00:12:17,410 --> 00:12:17,420
Fletcher lovely book here's a fairy made

489
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:21,100
Fletcher lovely book here's a fairy made
of a fairy made of a v-fold the it's

490
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:21,110
of a fairy made of a v-fold the it's

491
00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:23,440
of a fairy made of a v-fold the it's
actually an asymmetric v-fold the v-fold

492
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:23,450
actually an asymmetric v-fold the v-fold

493
00:12:23,450 --> 00:12:27,130
actually an asymmetric v-fold the v-fold
is pointing up the page so as you open

494
00:12:27,130 --> 00:12:27,140
is pointing up the page so as you open

495
00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:29,680
is pointing up the page so as you open
the page the fairy falls out of the book

496
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:29,690
the page the fairy falls out of the book

497
00:12:29,690 --> 00:12:32,500
the page the fairy falls out of the book
and as you close the page they're very

498
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:32,510
and as you close the page they're very

499
00:12:32,510 --> 00:12:34,180
and as you close the page they're very
you know jumps back into the book so

500
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:34,190
you know jumps back into the book so

501
00:12:34,190 --> 00:12:36,160
you know jumps back into the book so
that's a really delightful use of that

502
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:36,170
that's a really delightful use of that

503
00:12:36,170 --> 00:12:37,840
that's a really delightful use of that
that type of design you know and the

504
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:37,850
that type of design you know and the

505
00:12:37,850 --> 00:12:39,730
that type of design you know and the
fact that the v-fold folds down in the

506
00:12:39,730 --> 00:12:39,740
fact that the v-fold folds down in the

507
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:43,180
fact that the v-fold folds down in the
way it's pointing so now I'll show you

508
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:43,190
way it's pointing so now I'll show you

509
00:12:43,190 --> 00:12:50,050
way it's pointing so now I'll show you
how to make the acute angle v-fold so

510
00:12:50,050 --> 00:12:50,060
how to make the acute angle v-fold so

511
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:53,200
how to make the acute angle v-fold so
you get get your base sheet and fold it

512
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:53,210
you get get your base sheet and fold it

513
00:12:53,210 --> 00:13:03,660
you get get your base sheet and fold it
in half crease it really thoroughly

514
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:03,670


515
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:12,370
again and again right here's the piece

516
00:13:12,370 --> 00:13:12,380
again and again right here's the piece

517
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:16,060
again and again right here's the piece
we're going to make the the piece we're

518
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:16,070
we're going to make the the piece we're

519
00:13:16,070 --> 00:13:18,190
we're going to make the the piece we're
gonna make the pop-up with so fold this

520
00:13:18,190 --> 00:13:18,200
gonna make the pop-up with so fold this

521
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:25,240
gonna make the pop-up with so fold this
in half crease it really well and then

522
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:25,250
in half crease it really well and then

523
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:29,020
in half crease it really well and then
whereas with the right angle V fold we

524
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:29,030
whereas with the right angle V fold we

525
00:13:29,030 --> 00:13:31,150
whereas with the right angle V fold we
just folded straight across third from

526
00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:31,160
just folded straight across third from

527
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:33,520
just folded straight across third from
the bottom edge in this case we're going

528
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:33,530
the bottom edge in this case we're going

529
00:13:33,530 --> 00:13:36,340
the bottom edge in this case we're going
to fold it up at an angle so starting

530
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:36,350
to fold it up at an angle so starting

531
00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:38,410
to fold it up at an angle so starting
about half an inch up above the bottom

532
00:13:38,410 --> 00:13:38,420
about half an inch up above the bottom

533
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:41,560
about half an inch up above the bottom
corner this is the folded side fold it

534
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:41,570
corner this is the folded side fold it

535
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:44,890
corner this is the folded side fold it
up at an angle and the angle you fold is

536
00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:44,900
up at an angle and the angle you fold is

537
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:46,510
up at an angle and the angle you fold is
that will determine the shape of the

538
00:13:46,510 --> 00:13:46,520
that will determine the shape of the

539
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:49,329
that will determine the shape of the
pop-up that you that you make fold it

540
00:13:49,329 --> 00:13:49,339
pop-up that you that you make fold it

541
00:13:49,339 --> 00:13:55,390
pop-up that you that you make fold it
back on itself when you open this up the

542
00:13:55,390 --> 00:13:55,400
back on itself when you open this up the

543
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:57,670
back on itself when you open this up the
creases should be giving you a downward

544
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:57,680
creases should be giving you a downward

545
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:00,310
creases should be giving you a downward
pointing arrow it's really important

546
00:14:00,310 --> 00:14:00,320
pointing arrow it's really important

547
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:02,920
pointing arrow it's really important
that the arrow points down then if the

548
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:02,930
that the arrow points down then if the

549
00:14:02,930 --> 00:14:04,630
that the arrow points down then if the
arrow points up less an obtuse angle

550
00:14:04,630 --> 00:14:04,640
arrow points up less an obtuse angle

551
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:08,110
arrow points up less an obtuse angle
v-fold anyway we'll cut these cut the

552
00:14:08,110 --> 00:14:08,120
v-fold anyway we'll cut these cut the

553
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:18,840
v-fold anyway we'll cut these cut the
bottom in to gluing tacks

554
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:18,850


555
00:14:18,850 --> 00:14:23,110
right this is this is going to be your

556
00:14:23,110 --> 00:14:23,120
right this is this is going to be your

557
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:25,270
right this is this is going to be your
pop-up this is going to stand like this

558
00:14:25,270 --> 00:14:25,280
pop-up this is going to stand like this

559
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:28,420
pop-up this is going to stand like this
on the page look at how it is when it's

560
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:28,430
on the page look at how it is when it's

561
00:14:28,430 --> 00:14:30,850
on the page look at how it is when it's
on the page whether the tabs are

562
00:14:30,850 --> 00:14:30,860
on the page whether the tabs are

563
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:33,130
on the page whether the tabs are
actually going to overlap like if you're

564
00:14:33,130 --> 00:14:33,140
actually going to overlap like if you're

565
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:34,660
actually going to overlap like if you're
going quite tight like this they're

566
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:34,670
going quite tight like this they're

567
00:14:34,670 --> 00:14:41,880
going quite tight like this they're
overlapping so just trim a bit more off

568
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:41,890


569
00:14:41,890 --> 00:14:46,270
so with these you can decide how how

570
00:14:46,270 --> 00:14:46,280
so with these you can decide how how

571
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:49,120
so with these you can decide how how
close you want the the tabs to be

572
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:49,130
close you want the the tabs to be

573
00:14:49,130 --> 00:14:50,680
close you want the the tabs to be
sticking to the spine they've both got

574
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:50,690
sticking to the spine they've both got

575
00:14:50,690 --> 00:14:52,180
sticking to the spine they've both got
to stick the same distance from the

576
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:52,190
to stick the same distance from the

577
00:14:52,190 --> 00:14:55,630
to stick the same distance from the
spine but or quite wide the wider you go

578
00:14:55,630 --> 00:14:55,640
spine but or quite wide the wider you go

579
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:58,330
spine but or quite wide the wider you go
the more the the pop-up will lie down

580
00:14:58,330 --> 00:14:58,340
the more the the pop-up will lie down

581
00:14:58,340 --> 00:15:00,970
the more the the pop-up will lie down
and then the closer tighter you make the

582
00:15:00,970 --> 00:15:00,980
and then the closer tighter you make the

583
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:03,330
and then the closer tighter you make the
angle the more the pop-up will stand up

584
00:15:03,330 --> 00:15:03,340
angle the more the pop-up will stand up

585
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:07,600
angle the more the pop-up will stand up
so just again to make sure these the

586
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:07,610
so just again to make sure these the

587
00:15:07,610 --> 00:15:10,240
so just again to make sure these the
angles on the page match we start by

588
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:10,250
angles on the page match we start by

589
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:21,040
angles on the page match we start by
gluing one side so this is glowing up

590
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:21,050
gluing one side so this is glowing up

591
00:15:21,050 --> 00:15:23,440
gluing one side so this is glowing up
near the top of your page so you stick

592
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:23,450
near the top of your page so you stick

593
00:15:23,450 --> 00:15:26,170
near the top of your page so you stick
down one side make sure the central

594
00:15:26,170 --> 00:15:26,180
down one side make sure the central

595
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:28,870
down one side make sure the central
crease is lined up with the gully of the

596
00:15:28,870 --> 00:15:28,880
crease is lined up with the gully of the

597
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:34,780
crease is lined up with the gully of the
base so here it is fold it into its

598
00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:34,790
base so here it is fold it into its

599
00:15:34,790 --> 00:15:39,870
base so here it is fold it into its
close position put glue on the other

600
00:15:39,870 --> 00:15:39,880
close position put glue on the other

601
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:54,680
close position put glue on the other
other tab making a mess here

602
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:54,690


603
00:15:54,690 --> 00:16:04,220
and then close the place

604
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:04,230


605
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:07,350
there is the acute angle v-fold so the

606
00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:07,360
there is the acute angle v-fold so the

607
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,600
there is the acute angle v-fold so the
thing to understand with these to

608
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:09,610
thing to understand with these to

609
00:16:09,610 --> 00:16:11,580
thing to understand with these to
control it if you want the v-fold to

610
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:11,590
control it if you want the v-fold to

611
00:16:11,590 --> 00:16:14,670
control it if you want the v-fold to
stand up more either you make the angles

612
00:16:14,670 --> 00:16:14,680
stand up more either you make the angles

613
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:17,520
stand up more either you make the angles
on the base smaller or you make the

614
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:17,530
on the base smaller or you make the

615
00:16:17,530 --> 00:16:20,580
on the base smaller or you make the
angles on the pot that bigger if you

616
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:20,590
angles on the pot that bigger if you

617
00:16:20,590 --> 00:16:22,590
angles on the pot that bigger if you
want it to lie down more either you make

618
00:16:22,590 --> 00:16:22,600
want it to lie down more either you make

619
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:24,870
want it to lie down more either you make
the angles on the base bigger or you

620
00:16:24,870 --> 00:16:24,880
the angles on the base bigger or you

621
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:26,610
the angles on the base bigger or you
make the angles on the popups smaller

622
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:26,620
make the angles on the popups smaller

623
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:32,160
make the angles on the popups smaller
and that's really that's really key so

624
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:32,170
and that's really that's really key so

625
00:16:32,170 --> 00:16:34,770
and that's really that's really key so
now we just look at a few examples of

626
00:16:34,770 --> 00:16:34,780
now we just look at a few examples of

627
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:37,860
now we just look at a few examples of
how these how these pop-ups are used

628
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:37,870
how these how these pop-ups are used

629
00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:42,150
how these how these pop-ups are used
here's here's one this is the red bit

630
00:16:42,150 --> 00:16:42,160
here's here's one this is the red bit

631
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:46,050
here's here's one this is the red bit
the red bit is an acute angle v-fold and

632
00:16:46,050 --> 00:16:46,060
the red bit is an acute angle v-fold and

633
00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:48,180
the red bit is an acute angle v-fold and
it's got a couple of tabs cut into the

634
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:48,190
it's got a couple of tabs cut into the

635
00:16:48,190 --> 00:16:51,510
it's got a couple of tabs cut into the
top and that's holding this is raising

636
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:51,520
top and that's holding this is raising

637
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:53,280
top and that's holding this is raising
up this Bluebird so the whole thing

638
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:53,290
up this Bluebird so the whole thing

639
00:16:53,290 --> 00:16:57,110
up this Bluebird so the whole thing
folds down forwards as you close it

640
00:16:57,110 --> 00:16:57,120
folds down forwards as you close it

641
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:01,890
folds down forwards as you close it
here's another example this is a this is

642
00:17:01,890 --> 00:17:01,900
here's another example this is a this is

643
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:03,540
here's another example this is a this is
an acute angle v-fold

644
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:03,550
an acute angle v-fold

645
00:17:03,550 --> 00:17:06,210
an acute angle v-fold
raising a figure we've got a couple of

646
00:17:06,210 --> 00:17:06,220
raising a figure we've got a couple of

647
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:09,420
raising a figure we've got a couple of
counter faults built into the into the

648
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:09,430
counter faults built into the into the

649
00:17:09,430 --> 00:17:11,670
counter faults built into the into the
gullies where it where it joins the page

650
00:17:11,670 --> 00:17:11,680
gullies where it where it joins the page

651
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:13,470
gullies where it where it joins the page
and those are what what raised up the

652
00:17:13,470 --> 00:17:13,480
and those are what what raised up the

653
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:16,650
and those are what what raised up the
arms and we'll just have a look at a

654
00:17:16,650 --> 00:17:16,660
arms and we'll just have a look at a

655
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:20,880
arms and we'll just have a look at a
couple of a couple of books so this one

656
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:20,890
couple of a couple of books so this one

657
00:17:20,890 --> 00:17:25,620
couple of a couple of books so this one
is Sergeant charge and in this one if

658
00:17:25,620 --> 00:17:25,630
is Sergeant charge and in this one if

659
00:17:25,630 --> 00:17:28,580
is Sergeant charge and in this one if
you look at this this is the the V folds

660
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:28,590
you look at this this is the the V folds

661
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:31,500
you look at this this is the the V folds
are here you can see there's a V fold

662
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:31,510
are here you can see there's a V fold

663
00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:34,260
are here you can see there's a V fold
underneath maybe looking at it sideways

664
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:34,270
underneath maybe looking at it sideways

665
00:17:34,270 --> 00:17:36,690
underneath maybe looking at it sideways
on you can see there's a pair of v folds

666
00:17:36,690 --> 00:17:36,700
on you can see there's a pair of v folds

667
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:39,060
on you can see there's a pair of v folds
and they're actually raising a whole

668
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:39,070
and they're actually raising a whole

669
00:17:39,070 --> 00:17:42,690
and they're actually raising a whole
series of of parallelograms and the V

670
00:17:42,690 --> 00:17:42,700
series of of parallelograms and the V

671
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:45,000
series of of parallelograms and the V
fold folds away in the direction it's

672
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:45,010
fold folds away in the direction it's

673
00:17:45,010 --> 00:17:47,850
fold folds away in the direction it's
pointing so the V fold is pointing up

674
00:17:47,850 --> 00:17:47,860
pointing so the V fold is pointing up

675
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:50,940
pointing so the V fold is pointing up
the page so as you open it it's pretty

676
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:50,950
the page so as you open it it's pretty

677
00:17:50,950 --> 00:17:52,410
the page so as you open it it's pretty
good the way it makes all the figures

678
00:17:52,410 --> 00:17:52,420
good the way it makes all the figures

679
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:56,520
good the way it makes all the figures
come down so this is some v-folds used

680
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:56,530
come down so this is some v-folds used

681
00:17:56,530 --> 00:17:59,940
come down so this is some v-folds used
to raise parallelograms is another

682
00:17:59,940 --> 00:17:59,950
to raise parallelograms is another

683
00:17:59,950 --> 00:18:03,990
to raise parallelograms is another
example here this is planes of the Aces

684
00:18:03,990 --> 00:18:04,000
example here this is planes of the Aces

685
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,750
example here this is planes of the Aces
designed by I think it's Keith Mosely

686
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:06,760
designed by I think it's Keith Mosely

687
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:13,920
designed by I think it's Keith Mosely
and this is a this is that this is the V

688
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:13,930
and this is a this is that this is the V

689
00:18:13,930 --> 00:18:15,120
and this is a this is that this is the V
fold and

690
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:15,130
fold and

691
00:18:15,130 --> 00:18:17,610
fold and
it's raising up this Center plane that

692
00:18:17,610 --> 00:18:17,620
it's raising up this Center plane that

693
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:19,890
it's raising up this Center plane that
the plane is completely made of

694
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:19,900
the plane is completely made of

695
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:23,159
the plane is completely made of
parallelograms so this is the this is

696
00:18:23,159 --> 00:18:23,169
parallelograms so this is the this is

697
00:18:23,169 --> 00:18:26,480
parallelograms so this is the this is
the v-fold this is the galley the

698
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:26,490
the v-fold this is the galley the

699
00:18:26,490 --> 00:18:28,620
the v-fold this is the galley the
parallelograms are built into that gully

700
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:28,630
parallelograms are built into that gully

701
00:18:28,630 --> 00:18:31,140
parallelograms are built into that gully
is a whole array of parallelograms being

702
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:31,150
is a whole array of parallelograms being

703
00:18:31,150 --> 00:18:33,960
is a whole array of parallelograms being
raised up up vertically as there as the

704
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:33,970
raised up up vertically as there as the

705
00:18:33,970 --> 00:18:36,960
raised up up vertically as there as the
page opens and great bit of design that

706
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:36,970
page opens and great bit of design that

707
00:18:36,970 --> 00:18:41,970
page opens and great bit of design that
one and then finally there's a couple

708
00:18:41,970 --> 00:18:41,980
one and then finally there's a couple

709
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:45,480
one and then finally there's a couple
here there's some monster islands this

710
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:45,490
here there's some monster islands this

711
00:18:45,490 --> 00:18:48,630
here there's some monster islands this
is I think from 1979 or 1980 it's one of

712
00:18:48,630 --> 00:18:48,640
is I think from 1979 or 1980 it's one of

713
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:51,600
is I think from 1979 or 1980 it's one of
the really early sort of second wave of

714
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:51,610
the really early sort of second wave of

715
00:18:51,610 --> 00:18:56,539
the really early sort of second wave of
pop-up books and so this one this is a

716
00:18:56,539 --> 00:18:56,549
pop-up books and so this one this is a

717
00:18:56,549 --> 00:19:00,450
pop-up books and so this one this is a
this is a spread based on the right

718
00:19:00,450 --> 00:19:00,460
this is a spread based on the right

719
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:02,340
this is a spread based on the right
angle v-folds and you've got a couple of

720
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:02,350
angle v-folds and you've got a couple of

721
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:04,380
angle v-folds and you've got a couple of
counter folds at the top here so this

722
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:04,390
counter folds at the top here so this

723
00:19:04,390 --> 00:19:06,720
counter folds at the top here so this
whole bit it could be like that and by

724
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:06,730
whole bit it could be like that and by

725
00:19:06,730 --> 00:19:10,020
whole bit it could be like that and by
putting these extra extra creases in it

726
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:10,030
putting these extra extra creases in it

727
00:19:10,030 --> 00:19:12,240
putting these extra extra creases in it
comes down and gives you this extra bit

728
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:12,250
comes down and gives you this extra bit

729
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:15,180
comes down and gives you this extra bit
of dimension that's a right angle refold

730
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:15,190
of dimension that's a right angle refold

731
00:19:15,190 --> 00:19:18,060
of dimension that's a right angle refold
and then on the next page this is a

732
00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:18,070
and then on the next page this is a

733
00:19:18,070 --> 00:19:20,399
and then on the next page this is a
acute angle default giving you this

734
00:19:20,399 --> 00:19:20,409
acute angle default giving you this

735
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:23,760
acute angle default giving you this
monster and the way these arms work

736
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:23,770
monster and the way these arms work

737
00:19:23,770 --> 00:19:25,830
monster and the way these arms work
that's all to do with slots we do that
