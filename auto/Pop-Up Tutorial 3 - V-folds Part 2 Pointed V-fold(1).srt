it really thoroughly fold it back on

39
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:05,270
it really thoroughly fold it back on
itself crease it again you can't crease

40
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:05,280
itself crease it again you can't crease

41
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,609
itself crease it again you can't crease
it too much so fold it back up itself a

42
00:02:07,609 --> 00:02:07,619
it too much so fold it back up itself a

43
00:02:07,619 --> 00:02:10,190
it too much so fold it back up itself a
couple more times and really crease it

44
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:10,200
couple more times and really crease it

45
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:13,190
couple more times and really crease it
well this is this is the base sheet

46
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:13,200
well this is this is the base sheet

47
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,780
well this is this is the base sheet
having it well creased means that the

48
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:14,790
having it well creased means that the

49
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:17,780
having it well creased means that the
pop-up will move more sweetly so we

50
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:17,790
pop-up will move more sweetly so we

51
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:23,479
pop-up will move more sweetly so we
might as well make a say a red one take

52
00:02:23,479 --> 00:02:23,489
might as well make a say a red one take

53
00:02:23,489 --> 00:02:25,400
might as well make a say a red one take
your sheet of cards again no need to

54
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:25,410
your sheet of cards again no need to

55
00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:31,260
your sheet of cards again no need to
measure just cut it in half

56
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:31,270


57
00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:35,620
fold it in half no need to measure just

58
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:35,630
fold it in half no need to measure just

59
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:38,860
fold it in half no need to measure just
do it by eye again as with all creases

60
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:38,870
do it by eye again as with all creases

61
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:41,500
do it by eye again as with all creases
crease it really really thoroughly fold

62
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:41,510
crease it really really thoroughly fold

63
00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:44,580
crease it really really thoroughly fold
it back on itself

64
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:44,590


65
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:47,710
this time you make the fold from corner

66
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:47,720
this time you make the fold from corner

67
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:49,720
this time you make the fold from corner
to corner so you're doing a diagonal

68
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:49,730
to corner so you're doing a diagonal

69
00:02:49,730 --> 00:02:54,220
to corner so you're doing a diagonal
fold corner to corner with it with it

70
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:54,230
fold corner to corner with it with it

71
00:02:54,230 --> 00:02:57,880
fold corner to corner with it with it
folded in half so there's no wrong way

72
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:57,890
folded in half so there's no wrong way

73
00:02:57,890 --> 00:03:01,510
folded in half so there's no wrong way
to do this because it's symmetrical it

74
00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:01,520
to do this because it's symmetrical it

75
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:04,600
to do this because it's symmetrical it
can go either way fold it back on itself

76
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:04,610
can go either way fold it back on itself

77
00:03:04,610 --> 00:03:10,420
can go either way fold it back on itself
again so when you open it up you have an

78
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:10,430
again so when you open it up you have an

79
00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:13,030
again so when you open it up you have an
arrow all three all three creases are

80
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:13,040
arrow all three all three creases are

81
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:15,130
arrow all three all three creases are
meeting at the same point and those

82
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:15,140
meeting at the same point and those

83
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:17,860
meeting at the same point and those
extra creases the diagonal ones again

84
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:17,870
extra creases the diagonal ones again

85
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:25,320
extra creases the diagonal ones again
you can reinforce those one more time

86
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:25,330


87
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:27,910
now this is going to sit on your on your

88
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:27,920
now this is going to sit on your on your

89
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:32,890
now this is going to sit on your on your
page like this so one question is how

90
00:03:32,890 --> 00:03:32,900
page like this so one question is how

91
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:35,140
page like this so one question is how
tight you want it what actual shape of

92
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:35,150
tight you want it what actual shape of

93
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:36,760
tight you want it what actual shape of
pop-up you want do you want a really

94
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:36,770
pop-up you want do you want a really

95
00:03:36,770 --> 00:03:39,970
pop-up you want do you want a really
tight V fold or do you want a really

96
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:39,980
tight V fold or do you want a really

97
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:42,370
tight V fold or do you want a really
flat shape you can even go all the way

98
00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:42,380
flat shape you can even go all the way

99
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:45,190
flat shape you can even go all the way
flat and it will still work so I'll go

100
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:45,200
flat and it will still work so I'll go

101
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,590
flat and it will still work so I'll go
for something like this the second

102
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:47,600
for something like this the second

103
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:49,660
for something like this the second
question is what you do with the with

104
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:49,670
question is what you do with the with

105
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:51,580
question is what you do with the with
the flaps you can either cut them down

106
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:51,590
the flaps you can either cut them down

107
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:55,000
the flaps you can either cut them down
into narrow narrow flaps of v underneath

108
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:55,010
into narrow narrow flaps of v underneath

109
00:03:55,010 --> 00:03:57,220
into narrow narrow flaps of v underneath
it or you can leave them out wide and

110
00:03:57,220 --> 00:03:57,230
it or you can leave them out wide and

111
00:03:57,230 --> 00:04:00,100
it or you can leave them out wide and
you can use these these folds for making

112
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:00,110
you can use these these folds for making

113
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:02,890
you can use these these folds for making
that counter folds in so I'm going to do

114
00:04:02,890 --> 00:04:02,900
that counter folds in so I'm going to do

115
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:06,370
that counter folds in so I'm going to do
that turn it into counter folds so we

116
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:06,380
that turn it into counter folds so we

117
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:08,620
that turn it into counter folds so we
start just cut into the cat into the

118
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:08,630
start just cut into the cat into the

119
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:11,949
start just cut into the cat into the
folded edge so say we just do a couple

120
00:04:11,949 --> 00:04:11,959
folded edge so say we just do a couple

121
00:04:11,959 --> 00:04:18,340
folded edge so say we just do a couple
like this here fold it over just crease

122
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:18,350
like this here fold it over just crease

123
00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:22,090
like this here fold it over just crease
it well this one I've made the two cuts

124
00:04:22,090 --> 00:04:22,100
it well this one I've made the two cuts

125
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:23,500
it well this one I've made the two cuts
at different lengths so that will give

126
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:23,510
at different lengths so that will give

127
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:25,150
at different lengths so that will give
us a slightly different shape in the

128
00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:25,160
us a slightly different shape in the

129
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:29,950
us a slightly different shape in the
pop-up open it up and push those through

130
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:29,960
pop-up open it up and push those through

131
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:34,369
pop-up open it up and push those through
so that's one this is the other

132
00:04:34,369 --> 00:04:34,379
so that's one this is the other

133
00:04:34,379 --> 00:04:40,589
so that's one this is the other
so that's the that's the shape we're

134
00:04:40,589 --> 00:04:40,599
so that's the that's the shape we're

135
00:04:40,599 --> 00:04:43,020
so that's the that's the shape we're
going to get on it on the top crease you

136
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:43,030
going to get on it on the top crease you

137
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:44,820
going to get on it on the top crease you
can now do the same on the bottom crease

138
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:44,830
can now do the same on the bottom crease

139
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:48,390
can now do the same on the bottom crease
the bottom two creases so if we want it

140
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:48,400
the bottom two creases so if we want it

141
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:52,439
the bottom two creases so if we want it
all symmetric we do it all with the two

142
00:04:52,439 --> 00:04:52,449
all symmetric we do it all with the two

143
00:04:52,449 --> 00:04:56,520
all symmetric we do it all with the two
folds to two outer flaps fold it up make

144
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:56,530
folds to two outer flaps fold it up make

145
00:04:56,530 --> 00:05:00,059
folds to two outer flaps fold it up make
some cuts into those just do a couple

146
00:05:00,059 --> 00:05:00,069
some cuts into those just do a couple

147
00:05:00,069 --> 00:05:04,260
some cuts into those just do a couple
here there's a lot of room for

148
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:04,270
here there's a lot of room for

149
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:06,749
here there's a lot of room for
creativity in this and understanding

150
00:05:06,749 --> 00:05:06,759
creativity in this and understanding

151
00:05:06,759 --> 00:05:08,879
creativity in this and understanding
something really a really simple option

152
00:05:08,879 --> 00:05:08,889
something really a really simple option

153
00:05:08,889 --> 00:05:11,820
something really a really simple option
but you know if you make your own you

154
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:11,830
but you know if you make your own you

155
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:13,320
but you know if you make your own you
can really play around with these you

156
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:13,330
can really play around with these you

157
00:05:13,330 --> 00:05:17,339
can really play around with these you
can make them longer narrower multiple

158
00:05:17,339 --> 00:05:17,349
can make them longer narrower multiple

159
00:05:17,349 --> 00:05:20,550
can make them longer narrower multiple
there's all sorts of options so we'll

160
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:20,560
there's all sorts of options so we'll

161
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:26,629
there's all sorts of options so we'll
open this one up push these through one

162
00:05:26,629 --> 00:05:26,639
open this one up push these through one

163
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:36,779
open this one up push these through one
two three four push these ones down so

164
00:05:36,779 --> 00:05:36,789
two three four push these ones down so

165
00:05:36,789 --> 00:05:38,909
two three four push these ones down so
this is a shape you're gonna have now

166
00:05:38,909 --> 00:05:38,919
this is a shape you're gonna have now

167
00:05:38,919 --> 00:05:40,439
this is a shape you're gonna have now
again you can decide that you want these

168
00:05:40,439 --> 00:05:40,449
again you can decide that you want these

169
00:05:40,449 --> 00:05:42,629
again you can decide that you want these
other flaps left as part of the design

170
00:05:42,629 --> 00:05:42,639
other flaps left as part of the design

171
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:44,790
other flaps left as part of the design
or you might decide to trim them down so

172
00:05:44,790 --> 00:05:44,800
or you might decide to trim them down so

173
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:48,029
or you might decide to trim them down so
I'm going to trim them down so again

174
00:05:48,029 --> 00:05:48,039
I'm going to trim them down so again

175
00:05:48,039 --> 00:05:49,620
I'm going to trim them down so again
I'll just follow this sort of very

176
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:49,630
I'll just follow this sort of very

177
00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:52,830
I'll just follow this sort of very
pointy pointy shape so I'm just going to

178
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:52,840
pointy pointy shape so I'm just going to

179
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:59,010
pointy pointy shape so I'm just going to
cut it like this to the to the point so

180
00:05:59,010 --> 00:05:59,020
cut it like this to the to the point so

181
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:00,450
cut it like this to the to the point so
this is what your pop-up is going to be

182
00:06:00,450 --> 00:06:00,460
this is what your pop-up is going to be

183
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:02,370
this is what your pop-up is going to be
like now again you can decide you want

184
00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:02,380
like now again you can decide you want

185
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:04,200
like now again you can decide you want
it really tight or do you want quite a

00:06:06,930 --> 00:06:06,940
quite a wide shape so I'm gonna go for

189
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:08,809
quite a wide shape so I'm gonna go for
something like this

190
00:06:08,809 --> 00:06:08,819
something like this

191
00:06:08,819 --> 00:06:12,269
something like this
start by gluing one side with all these

192
00:06:12,269 --> 00:06:12,279
start by gluing one side with all these

193
00:06:12,279 --> 00:06:15,209
start by gluing one side with all these
all pop ups you need you need symmetry

194
00:06:15,209 --> 00:06:15,219
all pop ups you need you need symmetry

195
00:06:15,219 --> 00:06:20,850
all pop ups you need you need symmetry
so we're just glue one side smear the

196
00:06:20,850 --> 00:06:20,860
so we're just glue one side smear the

197
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:24,119
so we're just glue one side smear the
glue right up to the crease I tend to

00:06:26,670 --> 00:06:26,680
use my little finger so then all my

201
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:30,360
use my little finger so then all my
other fingers stay free from glue and I

202
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:30,370
other fingers stay free from glue and I

203
00:06:30,370 --> 00:06:32,490

here so we put the put the glue on the

250
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:47,990
here so we put the put the glue on the

251
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:49,840
here so we put the put the glue on the
smallest surface you don't put it on the

big surface which is sticking on you you

255
00:07:51,770 --> 00:07:55,300
big surface which is sticking on you you
put the glue onto the small small

256
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:55,310
put the glue onto the small small

257
00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:57,940
put the glue onto the small small
surface of the counter fold and you can

258
00:07:57,940 --> 00:07:57,950
surface of the counter fold and you can

259
00:07:57,950 --> 00:08:00,610
surface of the counter fold and you can
just stick the stick the extra piece

260
00:08:00,610 --> 00:08:00,620
just stick the stick the extra piece

261
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:05,410
just stick the stick the extra piece
onto that might as well do the same on

262
00:08:05,410 --> 00:08:05,420
onto that might as well do the same on

263
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:08,620
onto that might as well do the same on
the other side the card is slightly you

264
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:08,630
the other side the card is slightly you

265
00:08:08,630 --> 00:08:11,590
the other side the card is slightly you
can see it's slightly thin for this this

266
00:08:11,590 --> 00:08:11,600
can see it's slightly thin for this this

267
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,540
can see it's slightly thin for this this
length of piece so I might just trim

268
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:13,550
length of piece so I might just trim

well so let's just put the couple coming

276
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:30,020
well so let's just put the couple coming

277
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:33,219
well so let's just put the couple coming
up just so you can see all the all the

278
00:08:33,219 --> 00:08:33,229
up just so you can see all the all the

279
00:08:33,229 --> 00:08:38,350
up just so you can see all the all the
possible options so put glue on those

280
00:08:38,350 --> 00:08:38,360
possible options so put glue on those

281
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:44,530
possible options so put glue on those
two so you have a piece of lifting up

282
00:08:44,530 --> 00:08:44,540
two so you have a piece of lifting up

283
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:50,460
two so you have a piece of lifting up
like that and another one on here

284
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:50,470


285
00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:54,340
lifting up like that and you can also

lifting up like that and you can also

287
00:08:54,350 --> 00:08:56,890
lifting up like that and you can also
play with these these some planes that

we've created

291
00:08:57,910 --> 00:08:59,970
we've created
in the top four so I'll just make one

292
00:08:59,970 --> 00:08:59,980
in the top four so I'll just make one

293
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:02,310
in the top four so I'll just make one
more really narrow piece that will fit

294
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:02,320
more really narrow piece that will fit

295
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:13,050
more really narrow piece that will fit
into that fold it in half though again

296
00:09:13,050 --> 00:09:13,060
into that fold it in half though again

297
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:14,490
into that fold it in half though again
it doesn't actually need to be in half

298
00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:14,500
it doesn't actually need to be in half

299
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:16,290
it doesn't actually need to be in half
you can have a phone anywhere on it if

00:09:16,290 --> 00:09:16,300
you can have a phone anywhere on it if

301
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:18,720
you can have a phone anywhere on it if
you wanted a more asymmetric design just

302
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:18,730
you wanted a more asymmetric design just

303
00:09:18,730 --> 00:09:22,860
you wanted a more asymmetric design just
make a fold somewhere somewhere along

304
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:22,870
make a fold somewhere somewhere along

305
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:28,380
make a fold somewhere somewhere along
this strip put the glue in and you can

306
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:28,390
this strip put the glue in and you can

307
00:09:28,390 --> 00:09:30,480
this strip put the glue in and you can
just tuck that in there and stick it in

00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:54,010
equally maybe this or even this it it's

329
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:56,520
equally maybe this or even this it it's
just abstract yeah abstract shape so you

330
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:56,530
just abstract yeah abstract shape so you

331
00:09:56,530 --> 00:09:58,410
just abstract yeah abstract shape so you
can do what you like with it equally

332
00:09:58,410 --> 00:09:58,420
can do what you like with it equally

333
00:09:58,420 --> 00:10:01,200
can do what you like with it equally
these two planes can be extended so so

334
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:01,210
these two planes can be extended so so

335
00:10:01,210 --> 00:10:03,840
these two planes can be extended so so
you take a couple of just a couple more

336
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:03,850
you take a couple of just a couple more

337
00:10:03,850 --> 00:10:13,800
you take a couple of just a couple more
small pieces and I'll put the glue on

338
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:13,810
small pieces and I'll put the glue on

339
00:10:13,810 --> 00:10:20,780
small pieces and I'll put the glue on
the into the video

340
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:20,790


341
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:22,940
so you can have a piece coming out like

342
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:22,950
so you can have a piece coming out like

343
00:10:22,950 --> 00:10:27,380
so you can have a piece coming out like
that and maybe another one similar on

344
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:27,390
that and maybe another one similar on

345
00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:33,980
that and maybe another one similar on
the other side a bit uneven though then

346
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:33,990
the other side a bit uneven though then

347
00:10:33,990 --> 00:10:38,900
the other side a bit uneven though then
I trim that down so there's a point of

348
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:38,910
I trim that down so there's a point of

349
00:10:38,910 --> 00:10:40,280
I trim that down so there's a point of
v-fold and now I'll just show you a

350
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:40,290
v-fold and now I'll just show you a

351
00:10:40,290 --> 00:10:45,590
v-fold and now I'll just show you a
couple of examples this this spread is

352
00:10:45,590 --> 00:10:45,600
couple of examples this this spread is

353
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:48,800
couple of examples this this spread is
all made with this is a pointed v fault

354
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:48,810
all made with this is a pointed v fault

355
00:10:48,810 --> 00:10:50,990
all made with this is a pointed v fault
with the end cut off and you've got

356
00:10:50,990 --> 00:10:51,000
with the end cut off and you've got

357
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
with the end cut off and you've got
counter folds on each side which are

358
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:53,010
counter folds on each side which are

359
00:10:53,010 --> 00:10:55,550
counter folds on each side which are
used to raise the arms and legs this is

360
00:10:55,550 --> 00:10:55,560
used to raise the arms and legs this is

361
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:57,650
used to raise the arms and legs this is
another point of view fold it's got the

362
00:10:57,650 --> 00:10:57,660
another point of view fold it's got the

363
00:10:57,660 --> 00:11:00,500
another point of view fold it's got the
very tip cut off that's making the head

364
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:00,510
very tip cut off that's making the head

365
00:11:00,510 --> 00:11:03,610
very tip cut off that's making the head
so this is a couple of pointed v-folds

366
00:11:03,610 --> 00:11:03,620
so this is a couple of pointed v-folds

367
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:11,930
so this is a couple of pointed v-folds
there it goes in books this is some ten

368
00:11:11,930 --> 00:11:11,940
there it goes in books this is some ten

369
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:17,540
there it goes in books this is some ten
little monsters and in this one here's

370
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:17,550
little monsters and in this one here's

371
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:20,510
little monsters and in this one here's
the point of V folds in this case yeah

372
00:11:20,510 --> 00:11:20,520
the point of V folds in this case yeah

373
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:22,310
the point of V folds in this case yeah
here here are the flaps that have been

in the 60s this this is two point of

410
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:15,810
in the 60s this this is two point of

411
00:12:15,810 --> 00:12:17,300
in the 60s this this is two point of
view files this is an obviously

412
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:17,310
view files this is an obviously

413
00:12:17,310 --> 00:12:18,470
view files this is an obviously
appointed v fault

414
00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:18,480
appointed v fault

415
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,420
appointed v fault
this is a point of view fold with a

416
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:20,430
this is a point of view fold with a

417
00:12:20,430 --> 00:12:23,120
this is a point of view fold with a
large amount cut away v files have

418
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:23,130
large amount cut away v files have

419
00:12:23,130 --> 00:12:25,280
large amount cut away v files have
converging creases that all lease at the

420
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:25,290
converging creases that all lease at the

421
00:12:25,290 --> 00:12:26,990
converging creases that all lease at the
same points on the spine so if you

422
00:12:26,990 --> 00:12:27,000
same points on the spine so if you

423
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,480
same points on the spine so if you
follow this crease here and this one and

424
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:29,490
follow this crease here and this one and

425
00:12:29,490 --> 00:12:31,610
follow this crease here and this one and
this one you'll find they all meet at

426
00:12:31,610 --> 00:12:31,620
this one you'll find they all meet at

427
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:32,030
this one you'll find they all meet at
the same

428
00:12:32,030 --> 00:12:32,040
the same

429
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:34,490
the same
from this bond so that's the point of a

430
00:12:34,490 --> 00:12:34,500
from this bond so that's the point of a

431
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:41,269
from this bond so that's the point of a
fold now we'll move on to the obtuse

432
00:12:41,269 --> 00:12:41,279
fold now we'll move on to the obtuse

433
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:46,430
fold now we'll move on to the obtuse
angle default this one but this is the

434
00:12:46,430 --> 00:12:46,440
angle default this one but this is the

435
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:49,189
angle default this one but this is the
obtuse angle V fold the angles on each

436
00:12:49,189 --> 00:12:49,199
obtuse angle V fold the angles on each

00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:56,490
unusual mechanism you don't see it very

443
00:12:56,490 --> 00:12:58,460
unusual mechanism you don't see it very
often I'll show you how to make one of

444
00:12:58,460 --> 00:12:58,470
often I'll show you how to make one of

445
00:12:58,470 --> 00:13:17,930
often I'll show you how to make one of
these so take a base crease it well this

446
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:17,940
these so take a base crease it well this

447
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:20,030
these so take a base crease it well this
time we take out take the other half

448
00:13:20,030 --> 00:13:20,040
time we take out take the other half

449
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:29,319
time we take out take the other half
sheet of cards fold this in the middle

450
00:13:29,319 --> 00:13:29,329


451
00:13:29,329 --> 00:13:34,639
crease it crease it thoroughly and then

452
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:34,649
crease it crease it thoroughly and then

453
00:13:34,649 --> 00:13:38,689
crease it crease it thoroughly and then
this time here's the is the folded edge

454
00:13:38,689 --> 00:13:38,699
this time here's the is the folded edge

455
00:13:38,699 --> 00:13:41,120
this time here's the is the folded edge
start about a third of the way up and

456
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:41,130
start about a third of the way up and

457
00:13:41,130 --> 00:13:45,590
start about a third of the way up and
fold it downwards to the outer edges of

458
00:13:45,590 --> 00:13:45,600
fold it downwards to the outer edges of

459
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:51,379
fold it downwards to the outer edges of
the card so here it is fold it well when

460
00:13:51,379 --> 00:13:51,389
the card so here it is fold it well when

461
00:13:51,389 --> 00:13:55,250
the card so here it is fold it well when
you when you open this up you see that

462
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:55,260
you when you open this up you see that

463
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:57,069
you when you open this up you see that
you've got an upward pointing arrow

464
00:13:57,069 --> 00:13:57,079
you've got an upward pointing arrow

465
00:13:57,079 --> 00:13:59,870
you've got an upward pointing arrow
mostly with with them acute angle

466
00:13:59,870 --> 00:13:59,880
mostly with with them acute angle

467
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:01,340
mostly with with them acute angle
v-folds you'll have a downward pointing

468
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:01,350
v-folds you'll have a downward pointing

469
00:14:01,350 --> 00:14:03,019
v-folds you'll have a downward pointing
arrow that's the normal that's what

470
00:14:03,019 --> 00:14:03,029
arrow that's the normal that's what

471
00:14:03,029 --> 00:14:04,519
arrow that's the normal that's what
you're usually looking for but in this

472
00:14:04,519 --> 00:14:04,529
you're usually looking for but in this

473
00:14:04,529 --> 00:14:07,040
you're usually looking for but in this
case the creases form an arrow pointing

474
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:07,050
case the creases form an arrow pointing

475
00:14:07,050 --> 00:14:11,540
case the creases form an arrow pointing
up now cut out the from the point where

476
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:11,550
up now cut out the from the point where

477
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:14,860
up now cut out the from the point where
all the creases meet you just cut out a

478
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:14,870
all the creases meet you just cut out a

479
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:18,650
all the creases meet you just cut out a
thin wedge you cut gluing tabs on to the

480
00:14:18,650 --> 00:14:18,660
thin wedge you cut gluing tabs on to the

481
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:24,439
thin wedge you cut gluing tabs on to the
bottom cut off the end oh I'll make that

482
00:14:24,439 --> 00:14:24,449
bottom cut off the end oh I'll make that

483
00:14:24,449 --> 00:14:29,749
bottom cut off the end oh I'll make that
a bit bit tighter so this is your this

484
00:14:29,749 --> 00:14:29,759
a bit bit tighter so this is your this

485
00:14:29,759 --> 00:14:33,139
a bit bit tighter so this is your this
is your obtuse angle we let this

486
00:14:33,139 --> 00:14:33,149
is your obtuse angle we let this

487
00:14:33,149 --> 00:14:35,960
is your obtuse angle we let this
re-crease these these sand falls a bit

488
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:35,970
re-crease these these sand falls a bit

on your page like this you can go quite

500
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:53,050
on your page like this you can go quite

501
00:14:53,050 --> 00:14:56,910
on your page like this you can go quite
wide you can go quite tight but if you

502
00:14:56,910 --> 00:14:56,920
wide you can go quite tight but if you

503
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:59,370
wide you can go quite tight but if you
go too wide you'll see it starts lifting

504
00:14:59,370 --> 00:14:59,380
go too wide you'll see it starts lifting

505
00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:02,340
go too wide you'll see it starts lifting
off the page so according to the angles

506
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:02,350
off the page so according to the angles

507
00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:04,410
off the page so according to the angles
you've made and that will dictate how

508
00:15:04,410 --> 00:15:04,420
you've made and that will dictate how

509
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:07,740
you've made and that will dictate how
wide you can go so again we stick down

510
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:07,750
wide you can go so again we stick down

511
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:15,660

fold with it folded in half we get

516
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:20,529
fold with it folded in half we get

517
00:15:20,529 --> 00:15:22,980
fold with it folded in half we get
symmetrical angles on the pop-up and now

518
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:22,990
symmetrical angles on the pop-up and now

519
00:15:22,990 --> 00:15:24,480
symmetrical angles on the pop-up and now
the way we stick it down we're going to

520
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:24,490
the way we stick it down we're going to

521
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:28,579
the way we stick it down we're going to
get symmetrical angles on the pant so

522
00:15:28,579 --> 00:15:28,589
get symmetrical angles on the pant so

523
00:15:28,589 --> 00:15:33,120
get symmetrical angles on the pant so
there it is stick down one side make

524
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:33,130
there it is stick down one side make

525
00:15:33,130 --> 00:15:35,190
there it is stick down one side make
sure the the central crease in the

smear the glue right up to the crease

537
00:15:56,029 --> 00:15:57,340
smear the glue right up to the crease
that's pretty important

538
00:15:57,340 --> 00:15:57,350
that's pretty important

that the central gully will lean

548
00:16:16,929 --> 00:16:16,939
that the central gully will lean

549
00:16:16,939 --> 00:16:19,809
that the central gully will lean
backwards is the right angle V fold

550
00:16:19,809 --> 00:16:19,819
backwards is the right angle V fold

551
00:16:19,819 --> 00:16:22,929
backwards is the right angle V fold
so here's a version these are the right

552
00:16:22,929 --> 00:16:22,939
so here's a version these are the right

553
00:16:22,939 --> 00:16:25,090
so here's a version these are the right
angle v-folds the angles on the bottom a

00:16:27,369 --> 00:16:27,379
90 degrees whereas on this one they're

557
00:16:27,379 --> 00:16:31,449
90 degrees whereas on this one they're
more than 90 and these ones because it

558
00:16:31,449 --> 00:16:31,459
more than 90 and these ones because it

559
00:16:31,459 --> 00:16:34,119
more than 90 and these ones because it
because it falls down backwards and I

560
00:16:34,119 --> 00:16:34,129
because it falls down backwards and I

think the higher you want the pop up

562
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:36,050
think the higher you want the pop up

563
00:16:36,050 --> 00:16:37,869
think the higher you want the pop up
that the nearer the front it has to be

564
00:16:37,869 --> 00:16:37,879
that the nearer the front it has to be
