00:00:40,610 --> 00:00:45,690
scissors glue burns card the details

2
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:48,570
about these are all explained in v-folds
这些在教程1里已经解释过了

3
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:56,610
tutorial part 1 so there are five kinds
这是五种V形折

4
00:00:56,610 --> 00:00:59,910
of default the first is the the right
第一种是直角V形折

5
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:02,399
angle v-folds this is explained in part
在上节教程详细讲解了

6
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:09,800
1 the second is the cute angle default
锐角V形折也一样

7
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:14,430
this is also explained in part 1 the
第三种尖角V形折

8
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:19,110
third is the pointed v-fold this we're
和第四种钝角V形折

9
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:22,259
going to deal with in this tutorial the
是本节课就要讲解的

10
00:01:22,259 --> 00:01:26,550

11
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:27,810

12
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:33,390
tutorial and finally it's the asymmetric
最后一种非对称V形折

13
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:36,090
v-fold this will be in v-folds tutorial
是V形折第三部分内容

14
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:43,350
part 3 okay we're going to start by
进入正题吧

15
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:47,759
making a pointed v-fold so start with
首先制作个尖角V形折

16
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:51,179
the base sheet fold the card in half no
取出底页卡纸 对折

17
00:01:51,179 --> 00:01:53,399
need to measure no need to score with
没必要测量的太细

18
00:01:53,399 --> 00:01:56,940
this weight of cards at 160 g SN crease
我用的是160克的卡纸

19
00:01:56,940 --> 00:01:59,940
it really thoroughly fold it back on
对折要很彻底

20
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:05,280
itself crease it again you can't crease it too much
如果觉得已经很到位了

21
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,619
it too much so fold it back up itself a
翻过来再折一次

22
00:02:07,619 --> 00:02:10,200
couple more times and really crease it
一定要确保折彻底

23
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:13,200
well this is this is the base sheet
这就是基本页了

24
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,790
having it well creased means that the
折痕越彻底立体结构

25
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:17,790
pop-up will move more sweetly so we
活动起来就越顺滑

26
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:23,489
might as well make a say a red one take
来张红色的卡纸吧

27
00:02:23,489 --> 00:02:25,410
your sheet of cards again no need to
取出卡纸同样不用严格测量

28
00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:31,270
measure just cut it in half
剪一半

29
00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:35,630
fold it in half no need to measure just
对折 同样没必要测太细

30
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:38,870
do it by eye again as with all creases
目测即可

31
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:41,510
crease it really really thoroughly fold
两边都要

32
00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:44,590
it back on itself
折到彻底

33
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:47,720
this time you make the fold from corner
这次是角对角对折

34
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:49,730
to corner so you're doing a diagonal
沿对角线的

35
00:02:49,730 --> 00:02:54,230
fold corner to corner with it with it
对折即可

36
00:02:54,230 --> 00:02:57,890
folded in half so there's no wrong way
理论上不会出啥错

37
00:02:57,890 --> 00:03:01,520
to do this because it's symmetrical it
两面都是对称的

38
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:04,610
it can go either way fold it back on itself again
可以任意方向再折叠一次

39
00:03:04,610 --> 00:03:10,430
again so when you open it up you have an arrow
展开 得到个箭头

40
00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:13,040
arrow all three all three creases are
三个折痕都

41
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:15,140
meeting at the same point and those
汇聚到同一个点

42
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:17,870
those extra creases the diagonal ones again
那些额外折痕又汇聚到对角线

43
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:25,330
you can reinforce those one more time
你可以再次加强它们

44
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:27,920
now this is going to sit on your on your page like this
它将像这样固定在页面

45
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:32,900
page like this so one question is how tight you want it
要看你的立体结构

46
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:35,150
tight you want it what actual shape of
实际想呈现成什么样

47
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:36,770
pop-up you want do you want a really
是想要特别紧的V形折

48
00:03:36,770 --> 00:03:39,980
tight V fold or do you want a really
还是比较平坦的

49
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:42,380
flat shape you can even go all the way
甚至是完全放平的

50
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:45,200
flat and it will still work so I'll go
都不是问题

51
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,600
for something like this the second
我先做成这样

52
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:49,670
question is what you do with the with
第二个要考虑点是

53
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:51,590
with the flaps you can either cut them down
想对侧襟做什么文章

54
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:55,010
into narrow narrow flaps of v underneath

55
00:03:55,010 --> 00:03:57,230
it or you can leave them out wide and

56
00:03:57,230 --> 00:04:00,110
you can use these these folds for making

57
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:02,900
that counter folds in so I'm going to do

58
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:06,380
that turn it into counter folds so we

59
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:08,630
start just cut into the cat into the

60
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:11,959
folded edge so say we just do a couple

61
00:04:11,959 --> 00:04:18,350
like this here fold it over just crease

62
00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:22,100
it well this one I've made the two cuts

63
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:23,510
at different lengths so that will give

64
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:25,160
us a slightly different shape in the

65
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:29,960
pop-up open it up and push those through

66
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:34,379
so that's one this is the other

67
00:04:34,379 --> 00:04:40,599
so that's the that's the shape we're

68
00:04:40,599 --> 00:04:43,030
going to get on it on the top crease you

69
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:44,830
can now do the same on the bottom crease

70
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:48,400
the bottom two creases so if we want it

71
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:52,449
all symmetric we do it all with the two

72
00:04:52,449 --> 00:04:56,530
folds to two outer flaps fold it up make

73
00:04:56,530 --> 00:05:00,069
some cuts into those just do a couple

74
00:05:00,069 --> 00:05:04,270
here there's a lot of room for

75
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:06,759
creativity in this and understanding

76
00:05:06,759 --> 00:05:08,889
something really a really simple option

77
00:05:08,889 --> 00:05:11,830
but you know if you make your own you

78
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:13,330
can really play around with these you

79
00:05:13,330 --> 00:05:17,349
can make them longer narrower multiple

80
00:05:17,349 --> 00:05:20,560
there's all sorts of options so we'll

81
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:26,639
open this one up push these through one

82
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:36,789
two three four push these ones down so

83
00:05:36,789 --> 00:05:38,919
this is a shape you're gonna have now

84
00:05:38,919 --> 00:05:40,449
again you can decide that you want these

85
00:05:40,449 --> 00:05:42,639
other flaps left as part of the design

86
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:44,800
or you might decide to trim them down so

87
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:48,039
I'm going to trim them down so again

88
00:05:48,039 --> 00:05:49,630
I'll just follow this sort of very

89
00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:52,840
pointy pointy shape so I'm just going to

90
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:59,020
cut it like this to the to the point so

91
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:00,460
this is what your pop-up is going to be

92
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:02,380
like now again you can decide you want

93
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:04,210
it really tight or do you want quite a

94
00:06:04,210 --> 00:06:06,940
quite a wide shape so I'm gonna go for

95
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:08,819
something like this

96
00:06:08,819 --> 00:06:12,279
start by gluing one side with all these

97
00:06:12,279 --> 00:06:15,219
all pop ups you need you need symmetry

98
00:06:15,219 --> 00:06:20,860
so we're just glue one side smear the

99
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:24,129
glue right up to the crease I tend to

100
00:06:24,129 --> 00:06:26,680
use my little finger so then all my

101
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:30,370
other fingers stay free from glue and I

102
00:06:30,370 --> 00:06:32,500
can I can use them to touch other things

103
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:35,800
without cars sticking to them so there

104
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:36,069
we go

105
00:06:36,069 --> 00:06:40,690
stick one side down maybe move it in a

106
00:06:40,690 --> 00:06:43,990
little bit more make sure the central

107
00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:45,520
crease is lined up with the Central

108
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:46,910
Valley of the base

109
00:06:46,910 --> 00:06:49,100
fold the whole thing into its closed

110
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:50,680
position

111
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:59,590
put glue under put glue on the other tab

112
00:06:59,590 --> 00:07:08,230
smear the glue to the to the creases

113
00:07:08,230 --> 00:07:10,430
fold it into its closed position and

114
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:15,980
close the base so here it is now you

115
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:17,960
might you might leave these counter

116
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:19,730
folds just as they are they're just part

117
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:22,760
of the design alternatively you can use

118
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:24,710
them as muscle to lift other pieces of

119
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:27,350
cards so we'll just try playing around

120
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:29,630
with that for a bit so take a piece of

121
00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:32,960
card just cut some pieces to play with

122
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:35,660
and these can these can actually be any

123
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:38,710
size any shape it's completely up to you

124
00:07:38,710 --> 00:07:42,200
I'm just doing something fairly random

125
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:47,990
here so we put the put the glue on the

126
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:49,850
smallest surface you don't put it on the

127
00:07:49,850 --> 00:07:51,770
big surface which is sticking on you you

128
00:07:51,770 --> 00:07:55,310
put the glue onto the small small

129
00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:57,950
surface of the counter fold and you can

130
00:07:57,950 --> 00:08:00,620
just stick the stick the extra piece

131
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:05,420
onto that might as well do the same on

132
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:08,630
the other side the card is slightly you

133
00:08:08,630 --> 00:08:11,600
can see it's slightly thin for this this

134
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,550
length of piece so I might just trim

135
00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:16,070
that down in a minute they put one on

136
00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:24,440
there and you can actually use the other

137
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:27,410
the other faces of the counter fold as

138
00:08:27,410 --> 00:08:30,020
well so let's just put the couple coming

139
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:33,229
up just so you can see all the all the

140
00:08:33,229 --> 00:08:38,360
possible options so put glue on those

141
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:44,540
two so you have a piece of lifting up

142
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:50,470
like that and another one on here

143
00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:54,350
lifting up like that and you can also

144
00:08:54,350 --> 00:08:56,900
play with these these some planes that

145
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:57,910
we've created

146
00:08:57,910 --> 00:08:59,980
in the top four so I'll just make one

147
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:02,320
more really narrow piece that will fit

148
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:13,060
into that fold it in half though again

149
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:14,500
it doesn't actually need to be in half

150
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:16,300
you can have a phone anywhere on it if

151
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:18,730
you wanted a more asymmetric design just

152
00:09:18,730 --> 00:09:22,870
make a fold somewhere somewhere along

153
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:28,390
this strip put the glue in and you can

154
00:09:28,390 --> 00:09:30,490
just tuck that in there and stick it in

155
00:09:30,490 --> 00:09:32,980
and after you've added these pieces shut

156
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:36,850
the base and press it firmly so that all

157
00:09:36,850 --> 00:09:38,710
that for the gluing is so and so there

158
00:09:38,710 --> 00:09:39,190
we are

159
00:09:39,190 --> 00:09:41,020
this is just an abstract shape so you

160
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:42,700
can actually look at it anywhere there's

161
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:45,400
no right way there's no wrong way so you

162
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:47,200
might choose to look at it like that you

163
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,600
might choose to look at it like that

164
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:54,010
equally maybe this or even this it it's

165
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:56,530
just abstract yeah abstract shape so you

166
00:09:56,530 --> 00:09:58,420
can do what you like with it equally

167
00:09:58,420 --> 00:10:01,210
these two planes can be extended so so

168
00:10:01,210 --> 00:10:03,850
you take a couple of just a couple more

169
00:10:03,850 --> 00:10:13,810
small pieces and I'll put the glue on

170
00:10:13,810 --> 00:10:20,790
the into the video

171
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:22,950
so you can have a piece coming out like

172
00:10:22,950 --> 00:10:27,390
that and maybe another one similar on

173
00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:33,990
the other side a bit uneven though then

174
00:10:33,990 --> 00:10:38,910
I trim that down so there's a point of

175
00:10:38,910 --> 00:10:40,290
v-fold and now I'll just show you a

176
00:10:40,290 --> 00:10:45,600
couple of examples this this spread is

177
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:48,810
all made with this is a pointed v fault

178
00:10:48,810 --> 00:10:51,000
with the end cut off and you've got

179
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,010
counter folds on each side which are

180
00:10:53,010 --> 00:10:55,560
used to raise the arms and legs this is

181
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:57,660
another point of view fold it's got the

182
00:10:57,660 --> 00:11:00,510
very tip cut off that's making the head

183
00:11:00,510 --> 00:11:03,620
so this is a couple of pointed v-folds

184
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:11,940
there it goes in books this is some ten

185
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:17,550
little monsters and in this one here's

186
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:20,520
the point of V folds in this case yeah

187
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:22,320
here here are the flaps that have been

188
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,940
used to stick it down they're part of

189
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:26,730
the design and in fact rather than doing

190
00:11:26,730 --> 00:11:28,860
counter falls pieces have been stuck on

191
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:31,410
to each side that jut forward and the

192
00:11:31,410 --> 00:11:33,660
head is just saying and you can look at

193
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:35,670
it end on and see how it works

194
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:37,770
and you get it straight on this is using

195
00:11:37,770 --> 00:11:43,170
the book as background this is jungle

196
00:11:43,170 --> 00:11:47,460
days by Helen bomber and the trunk of

197
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:50,010
the tree is appointed V fold and it has

198
00:11:50,010 --> 00:11:52,860
as other v-folds added to the sides to

199
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:55,320
raise the figures it's got slots cut

200
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:57,600
into it to make these limbs stick out

201
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,510
and anyway the point of this is the

202
00:12:00,510 --> 00:12:03,620
trunk of the tree is appointed V fold

203
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:07,860
and lastly from Puss in Boots this is by

204
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:11,880
Wojtek cabassa czechoslovakian working

205
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:15,810
in the 60s this this is two point of

206
00:12:15,810 --> 00:12:17,310
view files this is an obviously

207
00:12:17,310 --> 00:12:18,480
appointed v fault

208
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,430
this is a point of view fold with a

209
00:12:20,430 --> 00:12:23,130
large amount cut away v files have

210
00:12:23,130 --> 00:12:25,290
converging creases that all lease at the

211
00:12:25,290 --> 00:12:27,000
same points on the spine so if you

212
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,490
follow this crease here and this one and

213
00:12:29,490 --> 00:12:31,620
this one you'll find they all meet at

214
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:32,040
the same

215
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:34,500
from this bond so that's the point of a

216
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:41,279
fold now we'll move on to the obtuse

217
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:46,440
angle default this one but this is the

218
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:49,199
obtuse angle V fold the angles on each

219
00:12:49,199 --> 00:12:51,509
side of the central crease of the pop up

220
00:12:51,509 --> 00:12:54,630
are more than 90 degrees it's quite an

221
00:12:54,630 --> 00:12:56,490
unusual mechanism you don't see it very

222
00:12:56,490 --> 00:12:58,470
often I'll show you how to make one of

223
00:12:58,470 --> 00:13:17,940
these so take a base crease it well this

224
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:20,040
time we take out take the other half

225
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:29,329
sheet of cards fold this in the middle

226
00:13:29,329 --> 00:13:34,649
crease it crease it thoroughly and then

227
00:13:34,649 --> 00:13:38,699
this time here's the is the folded edge

228
00:13:38,699 --> 00:13:41,130
start about a third of the way up and

229
00:13:41,130 --> 00:13:45,600
fold it downwards to the outer edges of

230
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:51,389
the card so here it is fold it well when

231
00:13:51,389 --> 00:13:55,260
you when you open this up you see that

232
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:57,079
you've got an upward pointing arrow

233
00:13:57,079 --> 00:13:59,880
mostly with with them acute angle

234
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:01,350
v-folds you'll have a downward pointing

235
00:14:01,350 --> 00:14:03,029
arrow that's the normal that's what

236
00:14:03,029 --> 00:14:04,529
you're usually looking for but in this

237
00:14:04,529 --> 00:14:07,050
case the creases form an arrow pointing

238
00:14:07,050 --> 00:14:11,550
up now cut out the from the point where

239
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:14,870
all the creases meet you just cut out a

240
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:18,660
thin wedge you cut gluing tabs on to the

241
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:24,449
bottom cut off the end oh I'll make that

242
00:14:24,449 --> 00:14:29,759
a bit bit tighter so this is your this

243
00:14:29,759 --> 00:14:33,149
is your obtuse angle we let this

244
00:14:33,149 --> 00:14:35,970
re-crease these these sand falls a bit

245
00:14:35,970 --> 00:14:39,240
and doing a bit more thoroughly if your

246
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:41,100
folds up thoroughly enough crease leave

247
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:43,240
the pop-up either won't open

248
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:46,180
clothes very well so it's very important

249
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:49,510
to increase it well this is going to sit

250
00:14:49,510 --> 00:14:53,050
on your page like this you can go quite

251
00:14:53,050 --> 00:14:56,920
wide you can go quite tight but if you

252
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:59,380
go too wide you'll see it starts lifting

253
00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:02,350
off the page so according to the angles

254
00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:04,420
you've made and that will dictate how

255
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:07,750
wide you can go so again we stick down

256
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:15,670
one side this symmetries is always

257
00:15:15,670 --> 00:15:18,880
important by cutting the by making the

258
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:20,529
fold with it folded in half we get

259
00:15:20,529 --> 00:15:22,990
symmetrical angles on the pop-up and now

260
00:15:22,990 --> 00:15:24,490
the way we stick it down we're going to

261
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:28,589
get symmetrical angles on the pant so

262
00:15:28,589 --> 00:15:33,130
there it is stick down one side make

263
00:15:33,130 --> 00:15:35,200
sure the the central crease in the

264
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:37,270
pop-up is lined up with the gully gully

265
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:41,529
of the base fold the whole thing shut to

266
00:15:41,529 --> 00:15:46,120
press it well put glue on the other the

267
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:53,779
other tab

268
00:15:53,779 --> 00:15:56,029
smear the glue right up to the crease

269
00:15:56,029 --> 00:15:57,350
that's pretty important

270
00:15:57,350 --> 00:16:04,910
fold it sucks there we go the two single

271
00:16:04,910 --> 00:16:08,899
V fold this is this is quite interesting

272
00:16:08,899 --> 00:16:11,990
because the the central crease of the

273
00:16:11,990 --> 00:16:15,560
pop-up falls backwards the other one

274
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:16,939
that the central gully will lean

275
00:16:16,939 --> 00:16:19,819
backwards is the right angle V fold

276
00:16:19,819 --> 00:16:22,939
so here's a version these are the right

277
00:16:22,939 --> 00:16:25,100
angle v-folds the angles on the bottom a

278
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:27,379
90 degrees whereas on this one they're

279
00:16:27,379 --> 00:16:31,459
more than 90 and these ones because it

280
00:16:31,459 --> 00:16:34,129
because it falls down backwards and I

281
00:16:34,129 --> 00:16:36,050
think the higher you want the pop up

282
00:16:36,050 --> 00:16:37,879
that the nearer the front it has to be

283
00:16:37,879 --> 00:16:40,250
yeah I'll just show you in a couple of

284
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:43,790
examples of obtuse angle V faults this

285
00:16:43,790 --> 00:16:46,189
is one you can see it just leans back

286
00:16:46,189 --> 00:16:48,290
slightly so that that works nicely for

287
00:16:48,290 --> 00:16:51,529
this design I've got one book that has

288
00:16:51,529 --> 00:16:55,879
them as a to tangle V fold and a pointed

289
00:16:55,879 --> 00:16:58,579
V fold in it so here it is the the book

290
00:16:58,579 --> 00:17:03,559
is Bow Wow by Chuck Murphy and this this

291
00:17:03,559 --> 00:17:05,990
is it under the triangle you open it up

292
00:17:05,990 --> 00:17:09,439
there's the pyramid is a pointed V fold

293
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:12,500
and the dog is an obtuse angle V Falls

294
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:15,439
and the best way to see this is to look

295
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:17,689
at the back of the design and there you

296
00:17:17,689 --> 00:17:20,000
can see the the central crease of the

297
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,669
dog is leaning backwards so the dog is

298
00:17:22,669 --> 00:17:25,309
obtuse angle V fold the pyramid is a

299
00:17:25,309 --> 00:17:30,190
pointed v-fold and that fits at some

300
00:17:30,190 --> 00:17:33,620
v-folds part to all the information I'm

301
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:35,990
giving you is in booths my book pop-up

302
00:17:35,990 --> 00:17:39,789
design from paper mechanics
