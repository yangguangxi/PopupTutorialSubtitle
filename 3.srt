1
00:00:40,610 --> 00:00:45,690
scissors glue burns card the details
剪刀 胶水

2
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:48,570
about these are all explained in v-folds
这些在教程1里已经解释过了

3
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:56,610
tutorial part 1 so there are five kinds
这是五种V形折

4
00:00:56,610 --> 00:00:59,910
of default the first is the the right
第一种是直角V形折

5
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:02,399
angle v-folds this is explained in part
在上节教程详细讲解了

6
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:09,800
1 the second is the cute angle default
锐角V形折也一样

7
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:14,430
this is also explained in part 1 the
第三种山形V折

8
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:19,110
third is the pointed v-fold this we're
和第四种钝角V形折

9
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:22,259
going to deal with in this tutorial the
是本节课就要讲解的

10
00:01:22,259 --> 00:01:26,550

11
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:27,810

12
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:33,390
tutorial and finally it's the asymmetric
最后一种非对称V形折

13
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:36,090
v-fold this will be in v-folds tutorial
是V形折第三部分内容

14
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:43,350
part 3 okay we're going to start by
进入正题吧

15
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:47,759
making a pointed v-fold so start with
首先制作个山形V折

16
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:51,179
the base sheet fold the card in half no
取出底页卡纸 对折

17
00:01:51,179 --> 00:01:53,399
need to measure no need to score with
没必要测量的太细

18
00:01:53,399 --> 00:01:56,940
this weight of cards at 160 g SN crease
我用的是160克的卡纸

19
00:01:56,940 --> 00:01:59,940
it really thoroughly fold it back on
对折要很彻底

20
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:05,280
itself crease it again you can't crease it too much
如果觉得已经很到位了

21
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,619
it too much so fold it back up itself a
翻过来再折一次

22
00:02:07,619 --> 00:02:10,200
couple more times and really crease it
一定要确保折彻底

23
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:13,200
well this is this is the base sheet
这就是基本页了

24
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,790
having it well creased means that the
折痕越彻底立体结构

25
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:17,790
pop-up will move more sweetly so we
活动起来就越顺滑

26
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:23,489
might as well make a say a red one take
来张红色的卡纸吧

27
00:02:23,489 --> 00:02:25,410
your sheet of cards again no need to
取出卡纸同样不用严格测量

28
00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:31,270
measure just cut it in half
剪一半

29
00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:35,630
fold it in half no need to measure just
对折 同样没必要测太细

30
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:38,870
do it by eye again as with all creases
目测即可

31
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:41,510
crease it really really thoroughly fold
两边都要

32
00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:44,590
it back on itself
折到彻底

33
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:47,720
this time you make the fold from corner
这次是角对角对折

34
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:49,730
to corner so you're doing a diagonal
沿对角线的

35
00:02:49,730 --> 00:02:54,230
fold corner to corner with it with it
对折即可

36
00:02:54,230 --> 00:02:57,890
folded in half so there's no wrong way
理论上不会出啥错

37
00:02:57,890 --> 00:03:01,520
to do this because it's symmetrical it
两面都是对称的

38
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:04,610
it can go either way fold it back on itself again
可以任意方向再折叠一次

39
00:03:04,610 --> 00:03:10,430
again so when you open it up you have an arrow
展开 得到个箭头

40
00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:13,040
arrow all three all three creases are
三个折痕都

41
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:15,140
meeting at the same point and those
汇聚到同一个点

42
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:17,870
those extra creases the diagonal ones again
那些额外折痕又汇聚到对角线

43
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:25,330
you can reinforce those one more time
你可以再次加强它们

44
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:27,920
now this is going to sit on your on your page like this
它将像这样固定在页面

45
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:32,900
page like this so one question is how tight you want it
要看你的立体结构

46
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:35,150
tight you want it what actual shape of
实际想呈现成什么样

47
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:36,770
pop-up you want do you want a really
是想要挺点的V形折

48
00:03:36,770 --> 00:03:39,980
tight V fold or do you want a really
还是比较平坦的

49
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:42,380
flat shape you can even go all the way
甚至是完全放平的

50
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:45,200
flat and it will still work so I'll go
都不是问题

51
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,600
for something like this the second
我先做成这样

52
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:49,670
question is what you do with the with
第二个要考虑点是

53
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:51,590
with the flaps you can either cut them down
想对侧襟做什么文章

54
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:55,010
into narrow flaps of v underneath
你可以把它们剪小点藏在V折底下

55
00:03:55,010 --> 00:03:57,230
it or you can leave them out wide and
也可以保留着露外面

56
00:03:57,230 --> 00:04:00,110
you can use these these folds for making
利用折角制作些反折景层

57
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:02,900
that counter folds in so I'm going to do
我下面演示下

58
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:06,380
that turn it into counter folds so we
制作反折

59
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:08,630
start just cut into the cat into the
折边叠起来

60
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:11,959
folded edge so say we just do a couple
沿这边剪出两个折

61
00:04:11,959 --> 00:04:18,350
like this here fold it over just crease
折出折痕

62
00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:22,100
it well this one I've made the two cuts
我剪得两个折长度不一样

63
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:23,510
at different lengths so that will give
这就产生出

64
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:25,160
us a slightly different shape in the
两个略有不同的形状

65
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:29,960
pop-up open it up and push those through
打开并把它们推进去

66
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:34,379
so that's one this is the other
一个 再来一个

67
00:04:34,379 --> 00:04:40,599
so that's the that's the shape we're
这就成了。

68
00:04:40,599 --> 00:04:43,030
going to get on it on the top crease you
你当然可以给侧

69
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:44,830
can now do the same on the bottom crease
折痕做同样事情 两侧都行

70
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:48,400
the bottom two creases so if we want it
如果想让两侧对称

71
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:52,449
all symmetric we do it all with the two
可以同时操作两边侧襟

72
00:04:52,449 --> 00:04:56,530
folds to two outer flaps fold it up make
把两边折起来

73
00:04:56,530 --> 00:05:00,069
some cuts into those just do a couple
剪出两个反折

74
00:05:00,069 --> 00:05:04,270
here there's a lot of room for creativity in this
这里有很大的创作空间

75
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:06,759
creativity in this and understanding
一些没固化要求的操作

76
00:05:06,759 --> 00:05:08,889
understanding something really a really simple option but you know
你如果练习下就会很容易懂

77
00:05:08,889 --> 00:05:11,830
but you know if you make your own you
在制作时

78
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:13,330
can really play around with these you
你可以随意尝试

79
00:05:13,330 --> 00:05:17,349
can make them longer narrower multiple
像反折的长短、宽窄、数量这些

80
00:05:17,349 --> 00:05:20,560
there's all sorts of options so we'll
都行的 继续看这个

81
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:26,639
open this one up push these through one
打开并把反折推起来 一个

82
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:36,789
two three four push these ones down so
两个 三个 四个  顶上是推进去

83
00:05:36,789 --> 00:05:38,919
this is a shape you're gonna have now
这就是效果啦

84
00:05:38,919 --> 00:05:40,449
again you can decide that you want these
然后你要决定

85
00:05:40,449 --> 00:05:42,639
other flaps left as part of the design
剩下的侧襟怎么处理 是当做设计的一部分

86
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:44,800
or you might decide to trim them down so
还是修剪掉

87
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:48,039
I'm going to trim them down so again
这里我是剪掉了

88
00:05:48,039 --> 00:05:49,630
I'll just follow this sort of very
呼应下这个尖尖的形状

89
00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:52,840
pointy pointy shape so I'm just going to
从侧面开始

90
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:59,020
cut it like this to the to the point so
剪到定点为止

91
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:00,460
this is what your pop-up is going to be
这就是立体结构要呈现的样子

92
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:02,380
like now again you can decide you want
现在你可以决定

93
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:04,210
it really tight or do you want quite a
是要更紧点还是宽点

94
00:06:04,210 --> 00:06:06,940
quite a wide shape so I'm gonna go for
这里我保持这个样子了

95
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:08,819
something like this

96
00:06:08,819 --> 00:06:12,279
start by gluing one side with all these
开始上胶水

97
00:06:12,279 --> 00:06:15,219
all pop ups you need you need symmetry
这时立体结构要对称

98
00:06:15,219 --> 00:06:20,860
so we're just glue one side smear the
我们从一侧开始上胶水

99
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:24,129
glue right up to the crease I tend to
我喜欢用小拇指

100
00:06:24,129 --> 00:06:26,680
use my little finger so then all my
这样我其他指头可以不受影响

101
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:30,370
other fingers stay free from glue and I


102
00:06:30,370 --> 00:06:32,500
can I can use them to touch other things
去碰别的东西

103
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:35,800
without cars sticking to them so there
也不怕误粘住

104
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:36,069
so there we go
好了

105
00:06:36,069 --> 00:06:40,690
stick one side down maybe move it in a
一侧向下 微调下

106
00:06:40,690 --> 00:06:43,990
little bit more make sure the central crease
确保中间折痕

107
00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:45,520
crease is lined up with the Central
跟基础页中折线是在一排

108
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:46,910
Valley of the base

109
00:06:46,910 --> 00:06:49,100
fold the whole thing into its closed
所有折页放回到收起位置

110
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:50,680

111
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:59,590
给另一粘口上胶水

112
00:06:59,590 --> 00:07:08,230
涂匀

113
00:07:08,230 --> 00:07:10,430
合上基础页

114
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:15,980
就酱

115
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:17,960
也许反折就这样放着了

116
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:19,730
设计就是这样

117
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:22,760
另一种用法 这些反折可以当肌肉用

118
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:24,710
支撑其他的元素

119
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:27,350
我来演示下

120
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:29,630
拿出点卡纸剪成片

121
00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:32,960
来做实验

122
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:35,660
你也可以剪成

123
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:38,710
任何想要的形状或大小

124
00:07:38,710 --> 00:07:42,200
像我这 剪得就很放飞了

125
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:47,990
把胶水涂到相对小的面上

126
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:49,850
不要涂到大的面

127
00:07:49,850 --> 00:07:51,770
会导致粘到你并不想被粘的地方

128
00:07:51,770 --> 00:07:55,310
这会是把胶水涂给相对小的反折

129
00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:57,950
粘上刚剪出的那片

130
00:07:57,950 --> 00:08:00,620
确认下粘牢了

131
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:05,420
对称位置不妨也弄个

132
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:08,630
刚粘这片纸尺寸

133
00:08:08,630 --> 00:08:11,600
有点头重脚轻

134
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,550
等会再来修剪下

135
00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:16,070
把这个粘上

136
00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:24,440
也可以给反折的

137
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:27,410
另一个面粘些元素

138
00:08:27,410 --> 00:08:30,020
这就来做一对吧

139
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:33,229
尝试下所有的

140
00:08:33,229 --> 00:08:38,360
可能性

141
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:44,540
给两侧上胶水 给这边竖一个

142
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:50,470
另一边也这样竖一个

143
00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:54,350
也可以在顶上

144
00:08:54,350 --> 00:08:56,900
这四个面(两个反折)

145
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:57,910
做文章

146
00:08:57,910 --> 00:08:59,980
我来演示下

147
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:02,320
剪出个略窄能放得下的纸条

148
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:13,060
对折下

149
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:14,500
这里不一定是对折

150
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:16,300
如果设计是非对称的

151
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:18,730
在纸条合适位置

152
00:09:18,730 --> 00:09:22,870
折叠即可

153
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:28,390
上胶水

154
00:09:28,390 --> 00:09:30,490
让纸条能在这卡住

155
00:09:30,490 --> 00:09:32,980
添加好后 合上基本页

156
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:36,850
牢牢按一会

157
00:09:36,850 --> 00:09:38,710
这就成型了

158
00:09:38,710 --> 00:09:39,190

159
00:09:39,190 --> 00:09:41,020
这是个抽象形状

160
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:42,700
可以从各方向观看

161
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:45,400
没那种是 对的错的

162
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:47,200
你可以正着

163
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,600
背着

164
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:54,010
甚至俯视 俯视翻转

165
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:56,530
没错 看抽象的作品

166
00:09:56,530 --> 00:09:58,420
你开心就好

167
00:09:58,420 --> 00:10:01,210
这个凹槽两面也能扩展

168
00:10:01,210 --> 00:10:03,850
剪两片小点的卡纸片

169
00:10:03,850 --> 00:10:13,810
给凹槽里上胶水

170
00:10:13,810 --> 00:10:20,790

171
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:22,950
得到个露出来的纸条

172
00:10:22,950 --> 00:10:27,390
另一个也一样

173
00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:33,990
貌似有点不太均衡

174
00:10:33,990 --> 00:10:38,910
我把另一个修齐

175
00:10:38,910 --> 00:10:40,290
这就是山形V折啦

176
00:10:40,290 --> 00:10:45,600
下面看个例子

177
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:48,810
这里是个山形V折

178
00:10:48,810 --> 00:10:51,000
尾部被剪掉了

179
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,010
两头都被做成反折

180
00:10:53,010 --> 00:10:55,560
用来撑起手脚

181
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:57,660
画面上另一个元素

182
00:10:57,660 --> 00:11:00,510
是个小的V折制作的头

183
00:11:00,510 --> 00:11:03,620
这是一对山形V折

184
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:11,940
来看些书的例子

185
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:17,550
《十只小怪兽》

186
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:20,520
这页是个山形V折

187
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:22,320
这里是侧襟

188
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,940
侧襟被融入到设计里

189
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:26,730
这里把元素

190
00:11:26,730 --> 00:11:28,860
粘在了两个侧面

191
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:31,410
而不是反折上

192
00:11:31,410 --> 00:11:33,660
头也是同理


193
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:35,670
从底部前方观察

194
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:37,770
能很直观的看明白

195
00:11:37,770 --> 00:11:43,170
来看《丛林岁月》

196
00:11:43,170 --> 00:11:47,460
这里树干运用了山形V折

197
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:50,010
一边还叠加了

198
00:11:50,010 --> 00:11:52,860
另一个V形折

199
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:55,320
撑起人物

200
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:57,600
还用了插槽实现树枝伸出效果

201
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,510
总之 这里关注的关键点

202
00:12:00,510 --> 00:12:03,620
树干是山形V折

203
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:07,860
最后看下《穿靴子的猫》

204
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:11,880
六十年代的作品

205
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:15,810
画面中有两个山形V折

206
00:12:15,810 --> 00:12:17,310
这边是个较明显的山形V折

207
00:12:17,310 --> 00:12:18,480

208
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,430
这边是个

209
00:12:20,430 --> 00:12:23,130
被大幅裁掉的山形V折

210
00:12:23,130 --> 00:12:25,290
所有折痕都汇聚向

211
00:12:25,290 --> 00:12:27,000
主轴上同一点

212
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,490
顺着这个折痕

213
00:12:29,490 --> 00:12:31,620
这个

214
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:32,040
和这个折痕

215
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:34,500
就能验证这种关系 以上就是山形V折

216
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:41,279
fold now we'll move on to the obtuse
我们继续钝角V折

217
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:46,440
angle default this one but this is the
这个就是钝角V折

218
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:49,199
obtuse angle V fold the angles on each
每个边上

219
00:12:49,199 --> 00:12:51,509
side of the central crease of the pop up
基础面和中心折线

220
00:12:51,509 --> 00:12:54,630
are more than 90 degrees it's quite an
呈的角度超过90度

221
00:12:54,630 --> 00:12:56,490
unusual mechanism you don't see it very
这种结构比较稀罕 不太常见

222
00:12:56,490 --> 00:12:58,470
often I'll show you how to make one of
我来演示下如何制作

223
00:12:58,470 --> 00:13:17,940
these so take a base crease it well this
拿出张卡纸做基础页

224
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:20,040
time we take out take the other half
认真对折下

225
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:29,329
sheet of cards fold this in the middle
拿出另一半卡纸做立体结构

226
00:13:29,329 --> 00:13:34,649
crease it crease it thoroughly and then
从中间对折  折彻底

227
00:13:34,649 --> 00:13:38,699
this time here's the is the folded edge
这次是沿折角

228
00:13:38,699 --> 00:13:41,130
start about a third of the way up and
大概三分之一位置

229
00:13:41,130 --> 00:13:45,600
fold it downwards to the outer edges of
向外边角折下来

230
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:51,389
the card so here it is fold it well when
确定折彻底了

231
00:13:51,389 --> 00:13:55,260
you when you open this up you see that
展开后

232
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:57,079
you've got an upward pointing arrow
能看到类似向上箭头的折痕

233
00:13:57,079 --> 00:13:59,880
mostly with with them acute angle
在锐角V折里

234
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:01,350
v-folds you'll have a downward pointing
通常会是向下箭头

235
00:14:01,350 --> 00:14:03,029
arrow that's the normal that's what

236
00:14:03,029 --> 00:14:04,529
you're usually looking for but in this
在这里箭头是向上

237
00:14:04,529 --> 00:14:07,050
case the creases form an arrow pointing

238
00:14:07,050 --> 00:14:11,550
up now cut out the from the point where
从边上折痕开始地方开始

239
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:14,870
all the creases meet you just cut out a
剪出比较窄的锲子形状

240
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:18,660
thin wedge you cut gluing tabs on to the
然后剪出粘口

241
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:24,449
bottom cut off the end oh I'll make that
在最后面

242
00:14:24,449 --> 00:14:29,759
a bit bit tighter so this is your this
剪紧一点收尾

243
00:14:29,759 --> 00:14:33,149
is your obtuse angle we let this
这就是锐角V折了

244
00:14:33,149 --> 00:14:35,970
re-crease these these sand falls a bit
再加强下折痕

245
00:14:35,970 --> 00:14:39,240
and doing a bit more thoroughly if your
如果折的不到位

246
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:41,100
folds up thoroughly enough crease leave
打开时就不是那么顺畅

247
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:43,240
the pop-up either won't open
所以

248
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:46,180
clothes very well so it's very important
折彻底真非常重要

249
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:49,510
to increase it well this is going to sit
放基本页上会是这样

250
00:14:49,510 --> 00:14:53,050
on your page like this you can go quite
你可以拉宽一点

251
00:14:53,050 --> 00:14:56,920
wide you can go quite tight but if you
也可以挺一点

252
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:59,380
go too wide you'll see it starts lifting off
但如果拉过宽 会把页面绷起来

253
00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:02,350
off the page so according to the angles
所以角度决定

254
00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:04,420
you've made and that will dictate how
能展开宽度的阈值

255
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:07,750
wide you can go so again we stick down
先来粘一侧

256
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:15,670
one side this symmetries is always

257
00:15:15,670 --> 00:15:18,880
important by cutting the by making the

258
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:20,529
fold with it folded in half we get

259
00:15:20,529 --> 00:15:22,990
symmetrical angles on the pop-up and now

260
00:15:22,990 --> 00:15:24,490
the way we stick it down we're going to

261
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:28,589
get symmetrical angles on the pant so

262
00:15:28,589 --> 00:15:33,130
there it is stick down one side make

263
00:15:33,130 --> 00:15:35,200
sure the the central crease in the

264
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:37,270
pop-up is lined up with the gully gully

265
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:41,529
of the base fold the whole thing shut to

266
00:15:41,529 --> 00:15:46,120
press it well put glue on the other the
给另一个粘口上胶水

267
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:53,779
other tab

268
00:15:53,779 --> 00:15:56,029
smear the glue right up to the crease
把胶水在折痕要涂匀

269
00:15:56,029 --> 00:15:57,350
that's pretty important
这相当重要

270
00:15:57,350 --> 00:16:04,910
fold it sucks there we go the two single
盖起来压牢 钝角折就成了

271
00:16:04,910 --> 00:16:08,899
V fold this is this is quite interesting
这蛮有意思的

272
00:16:08,899 --> 00:16:11,990
because the the central crease of the
中间折线有向后倒的感觉

273
00:16:11,990 --> 00:16:15,560
pop-up falls backwards the other one
另一种会有向后倾倒感

274
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:16,939
that the central gully will lean
的立体结构是

275
00:16:16,939 --> 00:16:19,819
backwards is the right angle V fold
直角V形折

276
00:16:19,819 --> 00:16:22,939
so here's a version these are the right

277
00:16:22,939 --> 00:16:25,100
angle v-folds the angles on the bottom a

278
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:27,379
90 degrees whereas on this one they're

279
00:16:27,379 --> 00:16:31,459
more than 90 and these ones because it

280
00:16:31,459 --> 00:16:34,129
because it falls down backwards and I

281
00:16:34,129 --> 00:16:36,050
think the higher you want the pop up

282
00:16:36,050 --> 00:16:37,879
that the nearer the front it has to be

283
00:16:37,879 --> 00:16:40,250
yeah I'll just show you in a couple of

284
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:43,790
examples of obtuse angle V faults this

285
00:16:43,790 --> 00:16:46,189
is one you can see it just leans back

286
00:16:46,189 --> 00:16:48,290
slightly so that that works nicely for

287
00:16:48,290 --> 00:16:51,529
this design I've got one book that has

288
00:16:51,529 --> 00:16:55,879
them as a to tangle V fold and a pointed

289
00:16:55,879 --> 00:16:58,579
V fold in it so here it is the the book

290
00:16:58,579 --> 00:17:03,559
is Bow Wow by Chuck Murphy and this this

291
00:17:03,559 --> 00:17:05,990
is it under the triangle you open it up

292
00:17:05,990 --> 00:17:09,439
there's the pyramid is a pointed V fold

293
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:12,500
and the dog is an obtuse angle V Falls

294
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:15,439
and the best way to see this is to look

295
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:17,689
at the back of the design and there you

296
00:17:17,689 --> 00:17:20,000
can see the the central crease of the

297
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,669
dog is leaning backwards so the dog is

298
00:17:22,669 --> 00:17:25,309
obtuse angle V fold the pyramid is a

299
00:17:25,309 --> 00:17:30,190
pointed v-fold and that fits at some

300
00:17:30,190 --> 00:17:33,620
v-folds part to all the information I'm

301
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:35,990
giving you is in booths my book pop-up

302
00:17:35,990 --> 00:17:39,789
design from paper mechanics
