2
00:00:38,710 --> 00:00:43,399
the same as in 1 & 2 we need cart
跟第一部分和第二部分一样

3
00:00:43,399 --> 00:00:47,390
this is photocopy cards 160 GSM scissors
我们需要卡纸 这里是160克的

4
00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:50,530
need no explanation and glue the same
剪刀 不解释

5
00:00:50,530 --> 00:00:59,390
same glue as was explained in part 1 so
胶水 不解释  胶水教程1详细说过了

6
00:00:59,390 --> 00:01:03,590
there are five kinds of v-fold the first
这是五种类型的V形折

7
00:01:03,590 --> 00:01:06,380
is the the right angle default this is
第一种是直角V形折 教程2第一部分解说过了

8
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:10,689
explained in part 1 the second is the
第二种 锐角V形折


9
00:01:10,689 --> 00:01:13,429
acute angle v-fold these also explained
也是教程2第一部分解说的


10
00:01:13,429 --> 00:01:18,319
in part 1 the third is the point of view
第三种 山形V形折

11
00:01:18,319 --> 00:01:21,950
fault this is V Falls part two and the
在教程3 V形折第二部分溜过


12
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:25,429
two single V fold is also V Falls part
第四种 钝角V形折 也是教程3第二部分

13
00:01:25,429 --> 00:01:28,549
two and the fifth and final type of V
第五种最后一种V形折

14
00:01:28,549 --> 00:01:31,369
fold this is the asymmetric V fault
异形状V形折

15
00:01:31,369 --> 00:01:33,020
this is too tall it's all about the
这节教程的主角

16
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:36,529
asymmetric v-fold most v-folds most pop
大多数V形折或者说

17
00:01:36,529 --> 00:01:39,649
up mechanisms are centered on the on the
大多立起结构都是

18
00:01:39,649 --> 00:01:41,450
spine fold and they're completely
垂直对齐主折线的


19
00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:44,299
symmetric so the asymmetric V fold is
它们是完全对称的

20
00:01:44,299 --> 00:01:47,509
useful it takes the takes the design off
非对称V形折在偏中心设计很好使


21
00:01:47,509 --> 00:01:49,849
center and is why it just makes the
简直跟鲇鱼一样的存在

22
00:01:49,849 --> 00:01:51,560
whole thing much more interesting those
能盘活整个设计

23
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:54,200
are it's very varied so I've got a whole
我这列举了

24
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:58,520
array of them here everyone different it
它们常见的几种形态 每个都不一样

25
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:00,709
all depends on the angles on the pop-up
所有都是依赖立起结构角度

26
00:02:00,709 --> 00:02:03,139
and the angles on the page and in each
和基础页的角度

27
00:02:03,139 --> 00:02:05,049
case all four angles are different
每个例子四个角都不同

28
00:02:05,049 --> 00:02:11,590
scientists show enough an array of these
所以我就随意拎个出来举例子

29
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:17,580
[Applause]

30
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:20,290
they're very hard to actually work out
很难主观臆测会制作出

31
00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:23,080
what the what shape you're going to make
什么形状

32
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:26,410
so you either need to know it's good to
所以不断试错

33
00:02:26,410 --> 00:02:28,750
make just make trial and error make a
是掌握这种V折不错的方法

34
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:32,230
whole series alternatively I'll explain
或者我的书里有个章节解释了

35
00:02:32,230 --> 00:02:33,700
in a minute in my book there's a
如何做选择

36
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:38,200
reference set that you can look at so so
有兴趣可以去了解

37
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:40,690
so here they are as you can see
就像现在看到的

38
00:02:40,690 --> 00:02:43,260
they the angles just moved all over the place and
稍微改变角度 就产生不一样的形状

39
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:48,780
have an enormous amount of potential
具有很多种的可能性

40
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:54,160
right take a face sheet and fold it well
来吧 拿张卡纸做基础页

41
00:02:54,160 --> 00:03:01,900
so here's a base sheet thoroughly
多折一折

42
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:04,870
creased as always counts can't stress
一直到折起后

43
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:08,170
that enough fold it back on itself and
不会有反弹

44
00:03:08,170 --> 00:03:14,680
again and again so opens and closes nice
确认展开合上都是良好 顺滑

45
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:20,549
and smoothly we'll take a sheet of cards
再来拿出张卡纸

46
00:03:20,549 --> 00:03:34,720
cut it in half fold it in half there
剪一半 对折

47
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:37,660
most nice pop-ups when you want the two
大多数立起结构

48
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:40,269
angles on each side in the pop-up piece
你都是想要两边角度对称的

49
00:03:40,269 --> 00:03:43,329
to be symmetric so most pop-ups most
所以大多立起结构、

50
00:03:43,329 --> 00:03:46,299
v-folds having folded it in half you
大多V形折一般先会对折

51
00:03:46,299 --> 00:03:49,030
then fold the tabs on to it in this case
然后折起粘口

52
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:50,829
all four angles are different the two
现在的这种 四个角都是不一样的

53
00:03:50,829 --> 00:03:52,720
angles on the pop-up and the two angles
即立起结构的两个角

54
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:55,030
on the base they're all different so in
和基础页上的两个角，他们都不同

55
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:58,299
this case having folded it in half just
在这里 折叠起来

56
00:03:58,299 --> 00:04:01,030
cast a little wedge wedge acid the
沿着立起结构对折边

57
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:02,940
bottom corner this is your folded sides
在底角剪出一个楔形口

58
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:06,670
so we just just cut a wedge out and now

59
00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:09,069
we now we fold the gluing tabs on to it
然后制作粘胶水的粘口

60
00:04:09,069 --> 00:04:13,000
so start with one side fold it maybe you
从一边开始

61
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:18,519
make quite a quite a large angle and
先制作一个大角度的侧面

62
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:21,400
maybe trim those chill nose corners down
粘口边上修正一点

63
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:23,620
a bit more

64
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:28,430
so there we are and then the other one
这样差不多了

65
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:32,240
let's make it much more acute so we'll
另一个做个更偏锐角的

66
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:40,960
come right up like this so we've got the
马上开始

67
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:43,610
two angles on your pop-up piece are
这样现在的立起结构

68
00:04:43,610 --> 00:04:45,770
completely different and again you know
有两个完全不同的角

69
00:04:45,770 --> 00:04:56,810
just cut that into the gluing time now
修一下粘口

70
00:04:56,810 --> 00:04:59,390
you put this on the put this on the page
修完后放基础页上

71
00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:01,550
this is the very fold always falls in
V折折叠收起时

72
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:03,890
the direction that the V is pointing
一般是朝向V指的方向

73
00:05:03,890 --> 00:05:05,930
it's going to be on your page something
在基础页上的体现是

74
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:06,620
like this
会超前倾倒

75
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:08,570
so it's going to fold down forward so
所以在粘贴时

76
00:05:08,570 --> 00:05:10,850
you need to position it up near the top
应该是粘在基础页

77
00:05:10,850 --> 00:05:11,800
of the page
偏后一点位置

78
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:15,740
lay up the central crease with the
粘口的折痕紧贴

79
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:17,690
gulley on the base so the central crease
基础页的中折线

80
00:05:17,690 --> 00:05:20,570
of the pop-up is lined up with the the
立起结构和基础页的中折线平行相交

81
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:25,160
crease of the base now mark the small
现在在小角度边做个标记

82
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:27,470
angle so you on your pop-up you've got a
立起结构现在是有一个大角 一个小角

83
00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:30,380
big angle and a small angle but this
我们标记的是小的

84
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:35,360
small angle so here's the line now this
来 跟我右手一起画条线

85
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,430
is a crucial bit you flip the whole
划重点 这里是关键

86
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:40,550
thing over so now you've got the big the
整个立起结构翻个面

87
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:43,370
big angle on the pop-up above the small
现在红色卡纸大角度会在

88
00:05:43,370 --> 00:05:46,700
angle on the page so if you were to glue
基础页划线的小角度面上方

89
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:50,240
it down following that line you could
如果直接沿线上胶水

90
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,160
glue it down like this in which case the
效果就会成这样

91
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:54,740
whole pop-up would lie flat when the
立起结构会平摊在基础页上

92
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:56,840
when the page is flat but in this case
这不是我们想要的效果

93
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:59,060
you want it to be in dimension you want
这里我们想要立体的效果

94
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:02,780
it 3d so you move this move this piece
所以把角度略微向内收一收

95
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:05,690
in slightly and it's just got to be
也就是粘的时候

96
00:06:05,690 --> 00:06:08,270
glued down somewhere between the line
粘口放在

97
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:10,700
you've marked and the central central
标记的线和中折线之间

98
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:14,510
gully of the the page and according to
另一边的粘口粘在哪

99
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:15,830
where you can learn it that would affect
会影响最终的形状

100
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:18,830
though the shape that you end up with so
结果说话

101
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:25,970
I'll just glue that
直接上胶水吧

102
00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:28,710
the really crucial thing with this is to
再强调下最重要的：

103
00:06:28,710 --> 00:06:30,600
make sure you flip it over so you get
翻转立起结构

104
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:33,350
the large the large angle on the pop-up
立起结构大角度边粘在

105
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:36,180
sticking over the small angle on the
基础页有小角度边的这面

106
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:43,110
page so here we are they make sure that
就像这样

107
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:45,360
you're gluing tab isn't going over there
要确保粘口不超过中折线谷沟

108
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,340
over the central gully if it does just
如果超过

109
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:50,160
trim it back a bit so that's that one
要剪掉那些超出部分

110
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:53,280
glued down now put the whole thing into
一边粘好后

111
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,840
its closed position
合起立起结构到折叠状态

112
00:06:54,840 --> 00:07:00,480
but glue on the other tab smear it right
给另一边上胶水

113
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:12,540
up to the crease bit more glue and then
涂抹均匀

114
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:17,000
fold it shut
折叠起来

115
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,350
so here we have an asymmetric free fold
这就是非对称V形折了

116
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:24,890
[Music]

117
00:07:24,890 --> 00:07:27,480
all four angles are different the two
这种结构四个角都是不同的

118
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,400
angles on the pop-up a difference and
立起结构两个角不同

119
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:32,130
the two angles on the on the base are
基础页的两个角也不同

120
00:07:32,130 --> 00:07:33,630
different so now I'll just do a little
下面我画个图解释下

121
00:07:33,630 --> 00:07:37,680
little diagram to explain how that how
其中原理

122
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:45,750
that works so if we take this is the
假设

123
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:53,550
this is the base sheet with the with the
这是基础页

124
00:07:53,550 --> 00:07:56,430
crease down the middle and I'll just
中折线在中间

125
00:07:56,430 --> 00:07:58,979
copy this one we've got the angle that
我仿照下这个形状

126
00:07:58,979 --> 00:08:01,620
it's glued down to is here this is where
这个角是刚粘的位置

127
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:04,650
the one side is glued we'll call that
和中折线呈的角定为 A

128
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:07,890
angle a on the other side we've got a


129
00:08:07,890 --> 00:08:11,580
much much wider angle we'll call that
另一边很大的这个角定为 B

130
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:18,419
angle B on the pop-up piece is the is
立起结构用虚线表示

131
00:08:18,419 --> 00:08:23,460
the dotted line we've got a big angle so
画个大点的角度

132
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:28,290
that's here with the with the tab and
画粘口

133
00:08:28,290 --> 00:08:32,099
we've got a small angle here with the
画小角度面

134
00:08:32,099 --> 00:08:36,210
tab and this is the rest of the cards
画粘口 和卡纸其它部分

135
00:08:36,210 --> 00:08:40,890
so we call these C this is angle C and
定大角度为 C

136
00:08:40,890 --> 00:08:46,589
this is angle D right the crucial thing
另一个角度为 D

137
00:08:46,589 --> 00:08:50,640
is the angles on each sides the angles
关键来了：

138
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:53,640
on the pop-up plus the base must be the
一边的立起结构角加基础面的角

139
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:55,950
same on the left and on the right so in
等于另一边立起结构角加基础面的角

140
00:08:55,950 --> 00:09:07,130
this case a plus C must equal B plus D
在这里就是 A + C = B + D

141
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:09,870
and the other factor is the angles on
另一个条件

142
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:12,270
the pop-up must be bigger than the
立起结构的两个角加起来

143
00:09:12,270 --> 00:09:18,230
angles on the on the base so C plus D
要大于基础页的两个角之和

144
00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:30,149
must be bigger then a plus B I'll just
也就是 C + D > A + B

145
00:09:30,149 --> 00:09:32,190
turn that around so you can so you can
我转下方向到镜头 看着更清晰

146
00:09:32,190 --> 00:09:36,029
see it clearly so a and B are the angles
A和B是基础页上的角

147
00:09:36,029 --> 00:09:39,660
on the base C and D are the angles on
C和D是立起结构上的角

148
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:40,380
the pop-up

149
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:46,650
so a plus C must equal B plus D so that
 A + C = B + D

150
00:09:46,650 --> 00:09:49,080
you have balance and so that the whole
这样达到了均衡

151
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:51,120
while thing stands up and doesn't lie flat on
为了让结构立起不趴在页面

152
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:54,150
the page the angles on the on the pop-up
立起结构的角之和

153
00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:56,220
must be bigger than the angles on the
必须大于基础页上的角之和

154
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:59,580
page so C plus D must be bigger than a
也就是 C + D > B + D

155
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:01,560
plus B I've got a few books that
下面介绍几本书

156
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:04,680
demonstrate the asymmetric v-fold first
演示非对称V形折

157
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:10,350
dinah topia so here it is the pop-up
第一本《恐龙帝国》
158
00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:13,470
that the dinosaur is rising from the
这个恐龙就是基于

159
00:10:13,470 --> 00:10:16,260
dinosaur is rising from an asymmetric
非对称V形折

160
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:19,230
v-fold so you'll see that the angle here
可以看到立起结构的角

161
00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:22,529
on the pop-up is bigger than the angle
大于基础页的角

162
00:10:22,529 --> 00:10:25,110
on the page and the angle here on the
另一面这边立起结构的角

163
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:28,620
pop-up is smaller than the angle on the
小于基础页上的角

164
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:31,020
page so that's the first one the the
这就是第一个例子

165
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:33,180
angle on the pop-up the two angles on
立起结构上两个角度和

166
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:34,920
the pop-up are the same as the two
等于基础页的两个角之和

167
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:37,380
angles on the page so when the page is
页面完全展开时

168
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:42,089
flat the pop-up is flat the second book
立起结构也会摊平

169
00:10:42,089 --> 00:10:44,900
is B where de storybook wolves
第二本《当心狼》

170
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:48,020
beware the storybook wolves and in this

171
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:50,960
one this is by a paper engineering by
作者是

172
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:52,880
Corrine Fletcher I think she's a really
赵四 [见视频末尾:)]

173
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:56,300
great paper engineer so here it is this
他是个了不起的纸艺工程师

174
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:59,540
fairy falling out of the page you can
这里是个小仙女落出页面

175
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:02,540
see the central the central gully on
可以看到中折线和仙女的谷沟

176
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:05,930
that on the ferry is really off-center
是偏离中心的

177
00:11:05,930 --> 00:11:09,770
so this is an asymmetric v-fold you can
这是个非对称V形折

178
00:11:09,770 --> 00:11:11,750
see it's asymmetric the central crease
可以观察到V形折的中折线

179
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:15,140
of the of the default is not lined up
没有跟主轴线

180
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:16,880
with the spine it's coming up with an
在一条线 而是有个角度

181
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:19,550
angle so this is the asymmetric V fold V
这就是非对称V形折

182
00:11:19,550 --> 00:11:22,160
folds fold down in the direction the
立起结构V指向的方向

183
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:24,380
direction that the V is pointing so
就是立起结构合闭的方向

184
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:27,800
there is as you close the page the V

185
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:30,529
fold folds up into it normally pop-ups

186
00:11:30,529 --> 00:11:32,360
are always built further up the page so

187
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:34,370
everything remains within there within

188
00:11:34,370 --> 00:11:36,560
the frame of the book the way their head

189
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,330
is lifted up that's just a small

190
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:40,790
parallel fold built into the gulley

191
00:11:40,790 --> 00:11:43,100
whether the v-fold attaches to the page

192
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:45,350
you can see that if I turn it round

193
00:11:45,350 --> 00:11:48,260
slightly you can see that's a parallel

194
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:51,740
fold raising her head and the last one

195
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:54,620
I'd like to show you is the little fish
最后要介绍的是

196
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:56,450
who cried shark and this has got a
《哭鲨小鱼》

197
00:11:56,450 --> 00:11:59,959
massive messy shark at the end these
最后页的鲨鱼

198
00:11:59,959 --> 00:12:02,120
both the head and the tail they're both
头和尾部都是非对称V形折

199
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:04,310
asymmetric v-folds you can see the
可以看到

200
00:12:04,310 --> 00:12:06,980
central crease on both these pop-ups
这些立起结构的折线

201
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:10,459
lean lean away from the central gully of
都是偏离书的谷沟

202
00:12:10,459 --> 00:12:13,279
the of the book and the tail this is a
最尾部是个反折

203
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:17,300
this is a counter fold so and again it's
严格说

204
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:19,250
actually an asymmetric one so you can
也是个非对称V形折

205
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:21,490
see that's giving you an extra pair of

206
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:25,970
extra pair of planes so that's a

207
00:12:25,970 --> 00:12:28,790
symmetric V folds and all of that is

208
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:33,020
explained in even more detail in in this

209
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:34,850
以上就是本节教程啦

210
00:12:34,850 --> 00:12:36,830
如果想了解更多

211
00:12:36,830 --> 00:12:38,540
可以考虑下我的书「pop-up design and paper mechanics」

212
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:41,120
前面说的内容

213
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:43,660
这本书中都有
