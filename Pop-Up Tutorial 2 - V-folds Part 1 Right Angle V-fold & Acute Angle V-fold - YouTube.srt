1
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:39,359
this tutorial is about V vaults one of

2
00:00:39,359 --> 00:00:41,760
the most important mechanisms in pop-up

3
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:44,159
design and so I'll just start by talking

4
00:00:44,159 --> 00:00:45,690
about the materials that we're going to

5
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:48,479
be using in this tutorial so most

6
00:00:48,479 --> 00:00:51,989
important is the card this is 160 GSM

7
00:00:51,989 --> 00:00:54,989
photocopy card and you can use heavier

8
00:00:54,989 --> 00:00:57,499
cards or you can even use heavy

9
00:00:57,499 --> 00:01:01,079
cartridge paper in this case is 160 GSM

10
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:04,140
the other materials is glue very

11
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:07,560
important the best glue is solvent based

12
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:11,400
adhesive water-based will work and the

13
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,350
problem with water based is it goes up

14
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:15,600
more slowly so it's harder to work with

15
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:18,060
and it also tends to buckle the card so

16
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:20,840
you don't get so such pleasing results

17
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:23,730
you can also use stick glue and stick

18
00:01:23,730 --> 00:01:25,830
glue is very clean very quick very easy

19
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:28,020
and for making rough dummies it's

20
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:31,110
absolutely fine but if you make a pop-up

21
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:33,210
that you want to last that's important

22
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:35,970
to you stick glue tends to dry out crack

23
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:37,850
and then your pop ups will fall apart

24
00:01:37,850 --> 00:01:40,380
the other thing you need is a pair of

25
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:44,970
scissors any scissors will do card glue

26
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:47,100
scissors that's all you need in this

27
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:50,400
tutorial and most of the others so all

28
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:53,190
pop ups need a base and so we start by

29
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:55,670
just folding a sheet of card in half

30
00:01:55,670 --> 00:01:58,440
crease it really thoroughly I can't

31
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:01,590
overemphasize how important it is to to

32
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:04,290
crease the card so fold it fold it back

33
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:04,980
on itself

34
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:11,840
crease it again this is your base

35
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,819
there is there are three principles in

36
00:02:14,819 --> 00:02:16,980
popper the first principle is that every

37
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:19,470
pop-up must span a gully and the first

38
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:21,750
gully is the spine fold down the middle

39
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:26,040
of the base the second principle is that

40
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:28,829
every pop-up must span a gully so it

41
00:02:28,829 --> 00:02:31,409
must be stuck down on each side and it

42
00:02:31,409 --> 00:02:33,269
must be balanced on each side of the

43
00:02:33,269 --> 00:02:35,939
gully so here's the gully in this case

44
00:02:35,939 --> 00:02:37,829
with v-folds which is what we're talking

45
00:02:37,829 --> 00:02:39,989
about in this tutorial it's the angles

46
00:02:39,989 --> 00:02:43,019
that balance so on the pop-up the angles

47
00:02:43,019 --> 00:02:45,150
on each side are the same and on the

48
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:47,190
base the angles on each side are the

49
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:50,819
same the third principle is that every

50
00:02:50,819 --> 00:02:53,459
pop-up creates gullies so here we have a

51
00:02:53,459 --> 00:02:56,489
pop-up this is a gully created in the

52
00:02:56,489 --> 00:02:58,500
middle and here's a parallelogram stuck

53
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:01,889
into it so it's the pop-up rising the

54
00:03:01,889 --> 00:03:05,040
gully the basic gully opening raises the

55
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,750
pop-up and then the pop-up Scully

56
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:10,620
opening raises the pop-up within it and

57
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:13,439
here's another example this is again

58
00:03:13,439 --> 00:03:16,799
it's another v-fold but in this case the

59
00:03:16,799 --> 00:03:21,419
the base opening opens the gully raises

60
00:03:21,419 --> 00:03:23,970
the pop-up the pink bit and that these

61
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:26,129
two parallelograms are stuck into the

62
00:03:26,129 --> 00:03:28,440
gullies created by the father so the

63
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:31,049
three principles every pop-up mass

64
00:03:31,049 --> 00:03:33,599
Panigale every pop-up must be balanced

65
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:35,849
on each side of the gully every pop-up

66
00:03:35,849 --> 00:03:37,829
creates gullies which more power works

67
00:03:37,829 --> 00:03:39,870
can be stuck into so those are the three

68
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:42,239
principles so now we move on to the

69
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:46,440
actual v-fold

70
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:50,230
there are five kinds of v-folds this is

71
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:52,060
the first one this is the right angle

72
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:54,610
v-fold so the angles on the pop-up are

73
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:58,110
both 90 degrees so that's the first one

74
00:03:58,110 --> 00:04:00,730
this is the second one this is the acute

75
00:04:00,730 --> 00:04:03,160
angle v-fold so the angles on each side

76
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:05,340
of the gully both less than 90 degrees

77
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:10,300
that's the the second type of v-fold the

78
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:13,569
third this is the pointy v-fold so it's

79
00:04:13,569 --> 00:04:15,730
a variation on the acute angle v-fold

80
00:04:15,730 --> 00:04:17,889
really but the the top rather than

81
00:04:17,889 --> 00:04:20,799
standing proud it comes down to to hit

82
00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:23,020
the page that's the third type of v-fold

83
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:25,210
again the angles on each side of the

84
00:04:25,210 --> 00:04:28,570
central crease are the same the fourth

85
00:04:28,570 --> 00:04:29,650
type of v-fold

86
00:04:29,650 --> 00:04:32,110
this is the obtuse angle default so in

87
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:35,050
this one the angles on the pop up on

88
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:36,820
each side of the central crease they're

89
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:39,520
both more than 90 degrees that's the two

90
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:43,120
things Greek default and finally we have

91
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,040
the asymmetric v-fold

92
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:49,000
so is the asymmetric v-fold in this one

93
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,610
all four angles are different the two

94
00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:53,740
angles on the pop-up are different the

95
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:55,870
two angles on the base are different but

96
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:58,030
still the angles on the left on the

97
00:04:58,030 --> 00:05:01,180
pop-up plus the base equals the angles

98
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:03,039
on the right on the pop-up and the base

99
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:06,160
so again we've got we've got balance so

100
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,560
those are the five types of v-fold

101
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:11,410
in this tutorial we're just working with

102
00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:13,360
these two the right angle v-folds and

103
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:16,539
the acute angle v-fold so i put these

104
00:05:16,539 --> 00:05:18,910
other ones away they come up in a later

105
00:05:18,910 --> 00:05:24,689
tutorial

106
00:05:24,689 --> 00:05:27,329
so we start by making one we'll make a

107
00:05:27,329 --> 00:05:30,849
right-angle v-folds so we take a base

108
00:05:30,849 --> 00:05:35,499
sheet folded thoroughly creased and then

109
00:05:35,499 --> 00:05:37,239
we'll take another sheet of cards to

110
00:05:37,239 --> 00:05:40,839
make the actual pop-up let's try a pink

111
00:05:40,839 --> 00:05:45,549
piece here just just cut it in half by

112
00:05:45,549 --> 00:05:52,589
eye doesn't really doesn't really matter

113
00:05:52,589 --> 00:05:58,739
fold it in half crease it thoroughly

114
00:05:58,739 --> 00:06:01,779
fold it back on it so I can't

115
00:06:01,779 --> 00:06:03,909
overemphasize how important it is to

116
00:06:03,909 --> 00:06:07,269
thoroughly crease all the folds on pop

117
00:06:07,269 --> 00:06:09,969
ups and then we want the angles on each

118
00:06:09,969 --> 00:06:11,979
side this is this is going to be your

119
00:06:11,979 --> 00:06:14,169
pop-up standing up like this on your

120
00:06:14,169 --> 00:06:16,989
page and so we need the angles on each

121
00:06:16,989 --> 00:06:19,329
side to be equal so in this case we fold

122
00:06:19,329 --> 00:06:21,879
it shut and fold some creases onto the

123
00:06:21,879 --> 00:06:28,569
bottom and again crease them well and

124
00:06:28,569 --> 00:06:30,939
then you have to cut out the the corner

125
00:06:30,939 --> 00:06:33,819
so from that point where the the creases

126
00:06:33,819 --> 00:06:36,129
converge you just cut out that angle and

127
00:06:36,129 --> 00:06:39,209
and cut off that bit so you've got these

128
00:06:39,209 --> 00:06:42,610
gluing tabs this shape and now now

129
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:44,259
you've cut that piece out you can fold

130
00:06:44,259 --> 00:06:46,539
these back individually and crease them

131
00:06:46,539 --> 00:06:54,639
really thoroughly so that's that one and

132
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:57,279
this one okay so we've got our pop-up

133
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:59,919
piece and the angles each side that are

134
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:02,259
matching so we know we've got balance

135
00:07:02,259 --> 00:07:04,509
there now we need to stick it to the

136
00:07:04,509 --> 00:07:08,709
page the way part these V folds fold

137
00:07:08,709 --> 00:07:10,749
down they fold down in the direction at

138
00:07:10,749 --> 00:07:13,479
the V is pointing so this one is going

139
00:07:13,479 --> 00:07:15,579
to fold down this way so it needs to be

140
00:07:15,579 --> 00:07:17,769
near the front of your front of your

141
00:07:17,769 --> 00:07:20,559
page and then the angle that you stick

142
00:07:20,559 --> 00:07:23,739
it to the to the base it can be anything

143
00:07:23,739 --> 00:07:25,509
you like you can have a shape like this

144
00:07:25,509 --> 00:07:28,509
where it's really tight close together

145
00:07:28,509 --> 00:07:31,419
or you can open it up wide and wider you

146
00:07:31,419 --> 00:07:34,269
can go as wide as you like it mustn't be

147
00:07:34,269 --> 00:07:36,339
at 90 degrees to the spine if it's 90

148
00:07:36,339 --> 00:07:37,120
degrees to the

149
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,530
buying the whole thing can just fall

150
00:07:38,530 --> 00:07:41,020
down so it's got to be less than 90

151
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:44,169
between the central gully and where it's

152
00:07:44,169 --> 00:07:46,750
gluing to the page and the way you glue

153
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:55,630
these just start by gluing one tab so we

154
00:07:55,630 --> 00:08:02,130
put put a bit of glue on it

155
00:08:02,130 --> 00:08:06,669
smear it right to the right to the to

156
00:08:06,669 --> 00:08:11,080
the fault I use my little finger so it's

157
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:13,389
not to get glue glue on my other hand

158
00:08:13,389 --> 00:08:15,550
other fingers so I can still use all the

159
00:08:15,550 --> 00:08:18,820
other fingers too to make things line up

160
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:22,360
the central gully of the pop-up with the

161
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:25,539
central gully of the base stick that bit

162
00:08:25,539 --> 00:08:30,490
down and just make it make it fun now

163
00:08:30,490 --> 00:08:38,589
you put glue on the other tab smear this

164
00:08:38,589 --> 00:08:42,219
up to the crease the edges aren't really

165
00:08:42,219 --> 00:08:43,870
important in pop up this always

166
00:08:43,870 --> 00:08:45,520
decreases you need to smear the glue

167
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:48,220
right up to the crease any measuring you

168
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:55,360
do always to the crease fold it shut and

169
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:59,290
here is the right angle V fold this type

170
00:08:59,290 --> 00:09:01,390
of V fold the right angle V fold is

171
00:09:01,390 --> 00:09:04,420
really good for architectural subjects

172
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:08,080
so here's one this is one I've made this

173
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,360
is a this is a right angle V fold

174
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:12,810
raising a garden it's raising

175
00:09:12,810 --> 00:09:15,160
parallelograms so this is the first

176
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:17,800
parallelogram it's glued into this gully

177
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,930
of the V fold and then this is the

178
00:09:19,930 --> 00:09:21,970
second parallelogram glued into this

179
00:09:21,970 --> 00:09:22,420
gully

180
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:25,060
so as the page closes the whole

181
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:28,170
configuration lifts up and falls away

182
00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:31,660
this book fantastic fairytales by Ron

183
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:32,380
van der Meer

184
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:35,620
is all made of this type of right angle

185
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:38,740
V fold so if we just skim through it is

186
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:43,600
the first one this is the V fold raising

187
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:46,570
this parallelogram house to the next

188
00:09:46,570 --> 00:09:49,839
page this is the V fold in this case

189
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:51,010
it's more open

190
00:09:51,010 --> 00:09:52,990
than the previous one and again you've

191
00:09:52,990 --> 00:09:56,139
got a parallelogram here and you've got

192
00:09:56,139 --> 00:09:58,209
parallelograms here glued into this

193
00:09:58,209 --> 00:10:01,589
gully where the v-fold glues to the page

194
00:10:01,589 --> 00:10:04,600
this is the third one again this is a

195
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:08,019
right angle V fold and this little table

196
00:10:08,019 --> 00:10:10,420
here this is a right angle V fold

197
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:13,510
raising a parallelogram here as the page

198
00:10:13,510 --> 00:10:15,940
closes you can see the main one this is

199
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:17,709
folding down in the direction that the

200
00:10:17,709 --> 00:10:20,230
that the V is pointing and the table

201
00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:22,149
that's folding down in the direction of

202
00:10:22,149 --> 00:10:23,920
these pointing so they both fold away

203
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:26,290
from each other and this is the final

204
00:10:26,290 --> 00:10:26,769
one

205
00:10:26,769 --> 00:10:29,139
this is a big big right angle V fold

206
00:10:29,139 --> 00:10:31,899
with an array of parallelograms this is

207
00:10:31,899 --> 00:10:33,730
the first one glued into this gulley

208
00:10:33,730 --> 00:10:36,010
this is the second one built into this

209
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:38,470
gulley this is the third one built into

210
00:10:38,470 --> 00:10:41,290
this gulley as the page closes the whole

211
00:10:41,290 --> 00:10:49,300
whole slew folds away when you look at

212
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:51,910
the pop-up it's not absolutely flat it

213
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:54,399
tends to be at a slight angle so when

214
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:56,319
you look into this right angle V fold

215
00:10:56,319 --> 00:10:59,139
that way the fact that the page isn't

216
00:10:59,139 --> 00:11:01,569
completely flat doesn't matter visually

217
00:11:01,569 --> 00:11:03,610
but if you look at it the other way

218
00:11:03,610 --> 00:11:05,949
around so you're looking into the

219
00:11:05,949 --> 00:11:08,170
mountain fold of it if the page isn't

220
00:11:08,170 --> 00:11:10,449
absolutely flat the whole thing sags

221
00:11:10,449 --> 00:11:13,180
towards you so that might be what you

222
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:15,279
want is part of your design but

223
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:17,889
otherwise the way you cure that is you

224
00:11:17,889 --> 00:11:22,120
move into the the acute angle V fold so

225
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:24,310
here's an acute angle V fold the

226
00:11:24,310 --> 00:11:26,230
mountain fold is pointing towards you

227
00:11:26,230 --> 00:11:28,540
the base doesn't have to be completely

228
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:31,300
flat and yet it still stands up stands

229
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:35,680
up upright it's also good in this type

230
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:38,170
if you're using it to the right angle V

231
00:11:38,170 --> 00:11:39,699
fold because it's near the front of the

232
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:42,300
page you don't have much room for

233
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:44,860
illustration text or whatever you want

234
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:48,160
whereas this type the acute angle V fold

235
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:51,430
because the V fold down towards you you

236
00:11:51,430 --> 00:11:52,899
can position the whole thing near the

237
00:11:52,899 --> 00:11:55,209
back of the page and then you've got

238
00:11:55,209 --> 00:11:57,100
plenty of space you know on your base

239
00:11:57,100 --> 00:12:00,819
for more illustration more pop-up text

240
00:12:00,819 --> 00:12:02,500
whatever you like

241
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:05,720
so you can just look at this book

242
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:09,230
this is beware of the storybook wolves

243
00:12:09,230 --> 00:12:11,750
the paper engineering is by M Corrine

244
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:17,420
Fletcher lovely book here's a fairy made

245
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:21,110
of a fairy made of a v-fold the it's

246
00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:23,450
actually an asymmetric v-fold the v-fold

247
00:12:23,450 --> 00:12:27,140
is pointing up the page so as you open

248
00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:29,690
the page the fairy falls out of the book

249
00:12:29,690 --> 00:12:32,510
and as you close the page they're very

250
00:12:32,510 --> 00:12:34,190
you know jumps back into the book so

251
00:12:34,190 --> 00:12:36,170
that's a really delightful use of that

252
00:12:36,170 --> 00:12:37,850
that type of design you know and the

253
00:12:37,850 --> 00:12:39,740
fact that the v-fold folds down in the

254
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:43,190
way it's pointing so now I'll show you

255
00:12:43,190 --> 00:12:50,060
how to make the acute angle v-fold so

256
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:53,210
you get get your base sheet and fold it

257
00:12:53,210 --> 00:13:03,670
in half crease it really thoroughly

258
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:12,380
again and again right here's the piece

259
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:16,070
we're going to make the the piece we're

260
00:13:16,070 --> 00:13:18,200
gonna make the pop-up with so fold this

261
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:25,250
in half crease it really well and then

262
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:29,030
whereas with the right angle V fold we

263
00:13:29,030 --> 00:13:31,160
just folded straight across third from

264
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:33,530
the bottom edge in this case we're going

265
00:13:33,530 --> 00:13:36,350
to fold it up at an angle so starting

266
00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:38,420
about half an inch up above the bottom

267
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:41,570
corner this is the folded side fold it

268
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:44,900
up at an angle and the angle you fold is

269
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:46,520
that will determine the shape of the

270
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:49,339
pop-up that you that you make fold it

271
00:13:49,339 --> 00:13:55,400
back on itself when you open this up the

272
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:57,680
creases should be giving you a downward

273
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:00,320
pointing arrow it's really important

274
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:02,930
that the arrow points down then if the

275
00:14:02,930 --> 00:14:04,640
arrow points up less an obtuse angle

276
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:08,120
v-fold anyway we'll cut these cut the

277
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:18,850
bottom in to gluing tacks

278
00:14:18,850 --> 00:14:23,120
right this is this is going to be your

279
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:25,280
pop-up this is going to stand like this

280
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:28,430
on the page look at how it is when it's

281
00:14:28,430 --> 00:14:30,860
on the page whether the tabs are

282
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:33,140
actually going to overlap like if you're

283
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:34,670
going quite tight like this they're

284
00:14:34,670 --> 00:14:41,890
overlapping so just trim a bit more off

285
00:14:41,890 --> 00:14:46,280
so with these you can decide how how

286
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:49,130
close you want the the tabs to be

287
00:14:49,130 --> 00:14:50,690
sticking to the spine they've both got

288
00:14:50,690 --> 00:14:52,190
to stick the same distance from the

289
00:14:52,190 --> 00:14:55,640
spine but or quite wide the wider you go

290
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:58,340
the more the the pop-up will lie down

291
00:14:58,340 --> 00:15:00,980
and then the closer tighter you make the

292
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:03,340
angle the more the pop-up will stand up

293
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:07,610
so just again to make sure these the

294
00:15:07,610 --> 00:15:10,250
angles on the page match we start by

295
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:21,050
gluing one side so this is glowing up

296
00:15:21,050 --> 00:15:23,450
near the top of your page so you stick

297
00:15:23,450 --> 00:15:26,180
down one side make sure the central

298
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:28,880
crease is lined up with the gully of the

299
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:34,790
base so here it is fold it into its

300
00:15:34,790 --> 00:15:39,880
close position put glue on the other

301
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:54,690
other tab making a mess here

302
00:15:54,690 --> 00:16:04,230
and then close the place

303
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:07,360
there is the acute angle v-fold so the

304
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,610
thing to understand with these to

305
00:16:09,610 --> 00:16:11,590
control it if you want the v-fold to

306
00:16:11,590 --> 00:16:14,680
stand up more either you make the angles

307
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:17,530
on the base smaller or you make the

308
00:16:17,530 --> 00:16:20,590
angles on the pot that bigger if you

309
00:16:20,590 --> 00:16:22,600
want it to lie down more either you make

310
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:24,880
the angles on the base bigger or you

311
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:26,620
make the angles on the popups smaller

312
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:32,170
and that's really that's really key so

313
00:16:32,170 --> 00:16:34,780
now we just look at a few examples of

314
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:37,870
how these how these pop-ups are used

315
00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:42,160
here's here's one this is the red bit

316
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:46,060
the red bit is an acute angle v-fold and

317
00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:48,190
it's got a couple of tabs cut into the

318
00:16:48,190 --> 00:16:51,520
top and that's holding this is raising

319
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:53,290
up this Bluebird so the whole thing

320
00:16:53,290 --> 00:16:57,120
folds down forwards as you close it

321
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:01,900
here's another example this is a this is

322
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:03,550
an acute angle v-fold

323
00:17:03,550 --> 00:17:06,220
raising a figure we've got a couple of

324
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:09,430
counter faults built into the into the

325
00:17:09,430 --> 00:17:11,680
gullies where it where it joins the page

326
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:13,480
and those are what what raised up the

327
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:16,660
arms and we'll just have a look at a

328
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:20,890
couple of a couple of books so this one

329
00:17:20,890 --> 00:17:25,630
is Sergeant charge and in this one if

330
00:17:25,630 --> 00:17:28,590
you look at this this is the the V folds

331
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:31,510
are here you can see there's a V fold

332
00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:34,270
underneath maybe looking at it sideways

333
00:17:34,270 --> 00:17:36,700
on you can see there's a pair of v folds

334
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:39,070
and they're actually raising a whole

335
00:17:39,070 --> 00:17:42,700
series of of parallelograms and the V

336
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:45,010
fold folds away in the direction it's

337
00:17:45,010 --> 00:17:47,860
pointing so the V fold is pointing up

338
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:50,950
the page so as you open it it's pretty

339
00:17:50,950 --> 00:17:52,420
good the way it makes all the figures

340
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:56,530
come down so this is some v-folds used

341
00:17:56,530 --> 00:17:59,950
to raise parallelograms is another

342
00:17:59,950 --> 00:18:04,000
example here this is planes of the Aces

343
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,760
designed by I think it's Keith Mosely

344
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:13,930
and this is a this is that this is the V

345
00:18:13,930 --> 00:18:15,130
fold and

346
00:18:15,130 --> 00:18:17,620
it's raising up this Center plane that

347
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:19,900
the plane is completely made of

348
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:23,169
parallelograms so this is the this is

349
00:18:23,169 --> 00:18:26,490
the v-fold this is the galley the

350
00:18:26,490 --> 00:18:28,630
parallelograms are built into that gully

351
00:18:28,630 --> 00:18:31,150
is a whole array of parallelograms being

352
00:18:31,150 --> 00:18:33,970
raised up up vertically as there as the

353
00:18:33,970 --> 00:18:36,970
page opens and great bit of design that

354
00:18:36,970 --> 00:18:41,980
one and then finally there's a couple

355
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:45,490
here there's some monster islands this

356
00:18:45,490 --> 00:18:48,640
is I think from 1979 or 1980 it's one of

357
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:51,610
the really early sort of second wave of

358
00:18:51,610 --> 00:18:56,549
pop-up books and so this one this is a

359
00:18:56,549 --> 00:19:00,460
this is a spread based on the right

360
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:02,350
angle v-folds and you've got a couple of

361
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:04,390
counter folds at the top here so this

362
00:19:04,390 --> 00:19:06,730
whole bit it could be like that and by

363
00:19:06,730 --> 00:19:10,030
putting these extra extra creases in it

364
00:19:10,030 --> 00:19:12,250
comes down and gives you this extra bit

365
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:15,190
of dimension that's a right angle refold

366
00:19:15,190 --> 00:19:18,070
and then on the next page this is a

367
00:19:18,070 --> 00:19:20,409
acute angle default giving you this

368
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:23,770
monster and the way these arms work

369
00:19:23,770 --> 00:19:25,840
that's all to do with slots we do that

370
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:28,500
in adult another tutorial

371
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:32,230
finally and there's a little book called

372
00:19:32,230 --> 00:19:38,530
pop fill pop fill and the first first

373
00:19:38,530 --> 00:19:41,380
spread it's got a whole lot of these are

374
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:44,049
really tiny v-folds with just one side

375
00:19:44,049 --> 00:19:46,659
projected up to give these these some

376
00:19:46,659 --> 00:19:49,780
tree tops so as you are going to close

377
00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:53,770
it yeah you can go on and the trees turn

378
00:19:53,770 --> 00:19:56,409
into and they start being replaced by

379
00:19:56,409 --> 00:19:58,720
machines they're still defaults all the

380
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,340
buildings are parallelograms that's

381
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:04,000
another tutorial so that's it for this

382
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,549
tutorial

383
00:20:05,549 --> 00:20:08,049
everything I've talked about is in this

384
00:20:08,049 --> 00:20:10,659
this book pop-up design and paper

385
00:20:10,659 --> 00:20:13,360
mechanics and everything I've talked

386
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:44,110
about today is in this book

387
00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:46,170
you
