1
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:39,359
这节课是讲V形折

2
00:00:39,359 --> 00:00:41,760
立体书中最重要的结构之一

3
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:44,159
开始先说下用的材料

4
00:00:44,159 --> 00:00:45,690
比较重要的是

5
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:48,479
卡纸的选择

6
00:00:48,479 --> 00:00:51,989
常见的是用160克卡纸

7
00:00:51,989 --> 00:00:54,989
你也可以用更重的

8
00:00:54,989 --> 00:00:57,499
[译:推荐230克左右]

9
00:00:57,499 --> 00:01:01,079
现在用的160克的

10
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:04,140
另外胶水也比较重要

11
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:07,560
这里推荐透明万能胶

12
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:11,400
粘接强度大、干燥速度适中

13
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,350
水性胶水也能用

14
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:15,600
但是干的慢 不顺手

15
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:18,060
还可能把卡纸弄变形

16
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:20,840
导致成品不够沃野

17
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:23,730
用固体胶呢

18
00:01:23,730 --> 00:01:25,830
干净 快捷 方便

19
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:28,020
做草稿是绝对没问题

20
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:31,110
但不太适合要长久保存

21
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:33,210
和拿来把玩的立体书

22
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:35,970
时间长了固体胶可能会开裂

23
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:37,850
立体书会散架

24
00:01:37,850 --> 00:01:40,380
另外 就是得把剪刀

25
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:44,970
用的很多

26
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:47,100
这节课就用到这些

27
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:53,190
立体书需要基础页面

28
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:55,670
就是把卡纸对折

29
00:01:55,670 --> 00:01:58,440
要多折几次 折到彻底

30
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:01,590
我觉得说三遍不过分

31
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:04,290
折完一边 翻过来

32
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:04,980
再缕缕另一面

33
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:11,840
这就是基础页面了

34
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,819
立体书有三项基本原则

35
00:02:14,819 --> 00:02:16,980
第一项

36
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:19,470
所有立体结构要跨谷沟

37
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:21,750
第一个谷沟是中折线这个

38
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:26,040
第二项原则

39
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:28,829
谷沟两侧折线要平衡

40
00:02:28,829 --> 00:02:31,409
谷沟的两侧要在基础页面立住

41
00:02:31,409 --> 00:02:33,269
两侧得达到均衡

42
00:02:33,269 --> 00:02:35,939
在这个例子里

43
00:02:35,939 --> 00:02:39,989
谷沟两侧夹角是均衡的

44
00:02:43,019 --> 00:02:45,150
基础页面上中折线两侧

45
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:47,190
也是均衡的

46
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:50,819
第三项原则

47
00:02:50,819 --> 00:02:53,459
所有立体书都会有谷沟

48
00:02:53,459 --> 00:02:56,489
这里的谷沟是在中间

49
00:02:56,489 --> 00:02:58,500
两边粘着平行四边形

50
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:01,889
立体书打开时

51
00:03:01,889 --> 00:03:05,040
也就是谷沟展开

52
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,750
产生的动能带动立体结构

53
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:10,620
和其他顺带元素

54
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:13,439
这有个例子

55
00:03:13,439 --> 00:03:16,799
也是个V形折

56
00:03:16,799 --> 00:03:21,419
基础页面打开谷沟

57
00:03:21,419 --> 00:03:23,970
谷沟带起粉色色块

58
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:26,129
粉色卡纸两侧的

59
00:03:26,129 --> 00:03:28,440
平行四边形也被带起来了

60
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:31,049
回顾下刚说的原则

61
00:03:31,049 --> 00:03:33,599
立体结构要跨过谷沟

62
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:35,849
谷沟两侧要达到一种平衡

63
00:03:35,849 --> 00:03:37,829
制造谷沟来产生动能

64
00:03:37,829 --> 00:03:39,870
以上就是三项原则

65
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:42,239
来看下实际应用中的V形折

66
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:50,230
这有五种V形折

67
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:52,060
第一种是直角V形折

68
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:56,660
卡纸两侧均是90度

69
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:58,110
过

70
00:03:58,110 --> 00:04:00,730
第二种是锐角V形折

71
00:04:00,730 --> 00:04:03,160
谷沟两侧角

72
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:07,700
都是小于90度

73
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:10,300
过

74
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:13,569
第三种 尖角V形折

75
00:04:13,569 --> 00:04:15,730
锐角形折的一种变体

76
00:04:15,730 --> 00:04:17,889
顶点趴着

77
00:04:17,889 --> 00:04:21,780
顶到基础页的很边上

78
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:23,020
不变的是

79
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:25,210
两侧折痕都是指向中折线

80
00:04:25,210 --> 00:04:28,570
第四种

81
00:04:28,570 --> 00:04:29,650
钝角V形折

82
00:04:29,650 --> 00:04:32,110
立体结构里

83
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:35,050
两侧向中间的折痕

84
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:36,820
都是超过90度

85
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:43,120
最后一种

86
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,040
非对称V形折

87
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:49,000
长这样的

88
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,610
四个角都不太一样

89
00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:53,740
绿色立体结构两侧角度不同

90
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:55,870
基础页上两边的角也不同

91
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:58,030
仍然有种规律

92
00:04:58,030 --> 00:05:01,180
左侧立面角加基础面角

93
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:03,039
等于右侧立面加基础面角

94
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:06,160
这样又是平衡的

95
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,560
以上就是五种常见V形折

96
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:11,410
这节课着重讲

97
00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:13,360
直角和锐角V形折

98
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:16,539
其他先退下

99
00:05:16,539 --> 00:05:18,910
后面教程再详细说

100
00:05:24,689 --> 00:05:27,329
我们从制作个直角V形折开始

101
00:05:27,329 --> 00:05:30,849
拿一张卡纸

102
00:05:30,849 --> 00:05:35,499
折彻底了

103
00:05:35,499 --> 00:05:37,239
再拿一张做立体结构

104
00:05:37,239 --> 00:05:40,839
来个骚粉色吧

105
00:05:40,839 --> 00:05:45,549
剪一半出来

106
00:05:45,549 --> 00:05:52,589
目测 大不走溜就行

107
00:05:52,589 --> 00:05:58,739
对折 折彻底

108
00:05:58,739 --> 00:06:01,779
翻过来 折彻底

109
00:06:01,779 --> 00:06:03,909
折彻底！

110
00:06:03,909 --> 00:06:09,969
折彻底说三遍不过分

111
00:06:09,969 --> 00:06:11,979
我们想让立体结构

112
00:06:11,979 --> 00:06:14,169
这样子立着

113
00:06:14,169 --> 00:06:16,989
两边的角度都一样

114
00:06:16,989 --> 00:06:19,329
操作如下

115
00:06:19,329 --> 00:06:21,879
先合上卡纸 从底部翻折

116
00:06:21,879 --> 00:06:28,569
翻个面 再折一次

117
00:06:28,569 --> 00:06:30,939
需要剪掉角落

118
00:06:30,939 --> 00:06:33,819
从中折线和折痕交汇点开始

119
00:06:33,819 --> 00:06:36,129
剪的带点角度

120
00:06:36,129 --> 00:06:39,209
剪掉多余部分后

121
00:06:39,209 --> 00:06:42,610
这就是上胶水的粘点了

122
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:44,259
剪开后 粘口这折痕可以再优化下

123
00:06:44,259 --> 00:06:46,539
一个一个来

124
00:06:46,539 --> 00:06:54,639
搞定    一个

125
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:57,279
另     一个

126
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:59,919
立体结构就出来了

127
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:02,259
两侧角度是一致的

128
00:07:02,259 --> 00:07:04,509
我们要把它粘到基础页上

129
00:07:04,509 --> 00:07:08,709
V形折折起来时

130
00:07:08,709 --> 00:07:10,749
是沿着V指向的方向落下的

131
00:07:10,749 --> 00:07:13,479
现在这个就是朝向我这边

132
00:07:13,479 --> 00:07:15,579
所以粘的时候

133
00:07:15,579 --> 00:07:17,769
要靠基本页前面一点

134
00:07:17,769 --> 00:07:20,559
离我远一点

135
00:07:20,559 --> 00:07:23,739
向基本页粘时是比较灵活的

136
00:07:23,739 --> 00:07:25,509
你可以粘成

137
00:07:25,509 --> 00:07:28,509
这种比较紧的形状

138
00:07:28,509 --> 00:07:31,419
也可以粘的很敞开

139
00:07:31,419 --> 00:07:34,269
但是最大宽度

140
00:07:34,269 --> 00:07:36,339
不能超过90度

141
00:07:36,339 --> 00:07:37,120
否则

142
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,530
会站不住 趴倒

143
00:07:38,530 --> 00:07:41,020
所以 离中折线谷沟

144
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:44,169
要小于90度哦

145
00:07:44,169 --> 00:07:46,750
粘的时候 稍注意下

146
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:55,630
从一边开始

147
00:07:55,630 --> 00:08:02,130
来 上一点胶

148
00:08:02,130 --> 00:08:06,669
在粘口上涂匀

149
00:08:06,669 --> 00:08:11,080
我习惯用小拇指粘胶水

150
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:13,389
这样 粘不到手的其他部位

151
00:08:13,389 --> 00:08:15,550
我就可以让

152
00:08:15,550 --> 00:08:18,820
其他指头同时做别的事

153
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:22,360
粘口一头靠着中折线

154
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:25,539
基础页谷沟确认粘上

155
00:08:25,539 --> 00:08:30,490
放倒立体结构

156
00:08:30,490 --> 00:08:38,589
上胶水涂匀

157
00:08:38,589 --> 00:08:42,219
边缘都要涂抹到胶水

158
00:08:42,219 --> 00:08:43,870
要确保折痕边缘都涂抹到胶水

159
00:08:43,870 --> 00:08:45,520
折痕对于立体书非常重要

160
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:48,220
right up to the crease any measuring you

161
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:55,360
do always to the crease fold it shut and

162
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:59,290
here is the right angle V fold this type

163
00:08:59,290 --> 00:09:01,390
of V fold the right angle V fold is

164
00:09:01,390 --> 00:09:04,420
really good for architectural subjects

165
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:08,080
so here's one this is one I've made this

166
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,360
is a this is a right angle V fold

167
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:12,810
raising a garden it's raising

168
00:09:12,810 --> 00:09:15,160
parallelograms so this is the first

169
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:17,800
parallelogram it's glued into this gully

170
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,930
of the V fold and then this is the

171
00:09:19,930 --> 00:09:21,970
second parallelogram glued into this

172
00:09:21,970 --> 00:09:22,420
gully

173
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:25,060
so as the page closes the whole

174
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:28,170
configuration lifts up and falls away

175
00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:31,660
this book fantastic fairytales by Ron

176
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:32,380
van der Meer

177
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:35,620
is all made of this type of right angle

178
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:38,740
V fold so if we just skim through it is

179
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:43,600
the first one this is the V fold raising

180
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:46,570
this parallelogram house to the next

181
00:09:46,570 --> 00:09:49,839
page this is the V fold in this case

182
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:51,010
it's more open

183
00:09:51,010 --> 00:09:52,990
than the previous one and again you've

184
00:09:52,990 --> 00:09:56,139
got a parallelogram here and you've got

185
00:09:56,139 --> 00:09:58,209
parallelograms here glued into this

186
00:09:58,209 --> 00:10:01,589
gully where the v-fold glues to the page

187
00:10:01,589 --> 00:10:04,600
this is the third one again this is a

188
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:08,019
right angle V fold and this little table

189
00:10:08,019 --> 00:10:10,420
here this is a right angle V fold

190
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:13,510
raising a parallelogram here as the page

191
00:10:13,510 --> 00:10:15,940
closes you can see the main one this is

192
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:17,709
folding down in the direction that the

193
00:10:17,709 --> 00:10:20,230
that the V is pointing and the table

194
00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:22,149
that's folding down in the direction of

195
00:10:22,149 --> 00:10:23,920
these pointing so they both fold away

196
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:26,290
from each other and this is the final

197
00:10:26,290 --> 00:10:26,769
one

198
00:10:26,769 --> 00:10:29,139
this is a big big right angle V fold

199
00:10:29,139 --> 00:10:31,899
with an array of parallelograms this is

200
00:10:31,899 --> 00:10:33,730
the first one glued into this gulley

201
00:10:33,730 --> 00:10:36,010
this is the second one built into this

202
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:38,470
gulley this is the third one built into

203
00:10:38,470 --> 00:10:41,290
this gulley as the page closes the whole

204
00:10:41,290 --> 00:10:49,300
whole slew folds away when you look at

205
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:51,910
the pop-up it's not absolutely flat it

206
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:54,399
tends to be at a slight angle so when

207
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:56,319
you look into this right angle V fold

208
00:10:56,319 --> 00:10:59,139
that way the fact that the page isn't

209
00:10:59,139 --> 00:11:01,569
completely flat doesn't matter visually

210
00:11:01,569 --> 00:11:03,610
but if you look at it the other way

211
00:11:03,610 --> 00:11:05,949
around so you're looking into the

212
00:11:05,949 --> 00:11:08,170
mountain fold of it if the page isn't

213
00:11:08,170 --> 00:11:10,449
absolutely flat the whole thing sags

214
00:11:10,449 --> 00:11:13,180
towards you so that might be what you

215
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:15,279
want is part of your design but

216
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:17,889
otherwise the way you cure that is you

217
00:11:17,889 --> 00:11:22,120
move into the the acute angle V fold so

218
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:24,310
here's an acute angle V fold the

219
00:11:24,310 --> 00:11:26,230
mountain fold is pointing towards you

220
00:11:26,230 --> 00:11:28,540
the base doesn't have to be completely

221
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:31,300
flat and yet it still stands up stands

222
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:35,680
up upright it's also good in this type

223
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:38,170
if you're using it to the right angle V

224
00:11:38,170 --> 00:11:39,699
fold because it's near the front of the

225
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:42,300
page you don't have much room for

226
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:44,860
illustration text or whatever you want

227
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:48,160
whereas this type the acute angle V fold

228
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:51,430
because the V fold down towards you you

229
00:11:51,430 --> 00:11:52,899
can position the whole thing near the

230
00:11:52,899 --> 00:11:55,209
back of the page and then you've got

231
00:11:55,209 --> 00:11:57,100
plenty of space you know on your base

232
00:11:57,100 --> 00:12:00,819
for more illustration more pop-up text

233
00:12:00,819 --> 00:12:02,500
whatever you like

234
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:05,720
so you can just look at this book

235
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:09,230
this is beware of the storybook wolves

236
00:12:09,230 --> 00:12:11,750
the paper engineering is by M Corrine

237
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:17,420
Fletcher lovely book here's a fairy made

238
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:21,110
of a fairy made of a v-fold the it's

239
00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:23,450
actually an asymmetric v-fold the v-fold

240
00:12:23,450 --> 00:12:27,140
is pointing up the page so as you open

241
00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:29,690
the page the fairy falls out of the book

242
00:12:29,690 --> 00:12:32,510
and as you close the page they're very

243
00:12:32,510 --> 00:12:34,190
you know jumps back into the book so

244
00:12:34,190 --> 00:12:36,170
that's a really delightful use of that

245
00:12:36,170 --> 00:12:37,850
that type of design you know and the

246
00:12:37,850 --> 00:12:39,740
fact that the v-fold folds down in the

247
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:43,190
way it's pointing so now I'll show you

248
00:12:43,190 --> 00:12:50,060
how to make the acute angle v-fold so

249
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:53,210
you get get your base sheet and fold it

250
00:12:53,210 --> 00:13:03,670
in half crease it really thoroughly

251
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:12,380
again and again right here's the piece

252
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:16,070
we're going to make the the piece we're

253
00:13:16,070 --> 00:13:18,200
gonna make the pop-up with so fold this

254
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:25,250
in half crease it really well and then

255
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:29,030
whereas with the right angle V fold we

256
00:13:29,030 --> 00:13:31,160
just folded straight across third from

257
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:33,530
the bottom edge in this case we're going

258
00:13:33,530 --> 00:13:36,350
to fold it up at an angle so starting

259
00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:38,420
about half an inch up above the bottom

260
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:41,570
corner this is the folded side fold it

261
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:44,900
up at an angle and the angle you fold is

262
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:46,520
that will determine the shape of the

263
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:49,339
pop-up that you that you make fold it

264
00:13:49,339 --> 00:13:55,400
back on itself when you open this up the

265
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:57,680
creases should be giving you a downward

266
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:00,320
pointing arrow it's really important

267
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:02,930
that the arrow points down then if the

268
00:14:02,930 --> 00:14:04,640
arrow points up less an obtuse angle

269
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:08,120
v-fold anyway we'll cut these cut the

270
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:18,850
bottom in to gluing tacks

271
00:14:18,850 --> 00:14:23,120
right this is this is going to be your

272
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:25,280
pop-up this is going to stand like this

273
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:28,430
on the page look at how it is when it's

274
00:14:28,430 --> 00:14:30,860
on the page whether the tabs are

275
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:33,140
actually going to overlap like if you're

276
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:34,670
going quite tight like this they're

277
00:14:34,670 --> 00:14:41,890
overlapping so just trim a bit more off

278
00:14:41,890 --> 00:14:46,280
so with these you can decide how how

279
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:49,130
close you want the the tabs to be

280
00:14:49,130 --> 00:14:50,690
sticking to the spine they've both got

281
00:14:50,690 --> 00:14:52,190
to stick the same distance from the

282
00:14:52,190 --> 00:14:55,640
spine but or quite wide the wider you go

283
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:58,340
the more the the pop-up will lie down

284
00:14:58,340 --> 00:15:00,980
and then the closer tighter you make the

285
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:03,340
angle the more the pop-up will stand up

286
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:07,610
so just again to make sure these the

287
00:15:07,610 --> 00:15:10,250
angles on the page match we start by

288
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:21,050
gluing one side so this is glowing up

289
00:15:21,050 --> 00:15:23,450
near the top of your page so you stick

290
00:15:23,450 --> 00:15:26,180
down one side make sure the central

291
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:28,880
crease is lined up with the gully of the

292
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:34,790
base so here it is fold it into its

293
00:15:34,790 --> 00:15:39,880
close position put glue on the other

294
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:54,690
other tab making a mess here

295
00:15:54,690 --> 00:16:04,230
and then close the place

296
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:07,360
there is the acute angle v-fold so the

297
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,610
thing to understand with these to

298
00:16:09,610 --> 00:16:11,590
control it if you want the v-fold to

299
00:16:11,590 --> 00:16:14,680
stand up more either you make the angles

300
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:17,530
on the base smaller or you make the

301
00:16:17,530 --> 00:16:20,590
angles on the pot that bigger if you

302
00:16:20,590 --> 00:16:22,600
want it to lie down more either you make

303
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:24,880
the angles on the base bigger or you

304
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:26,620
make the angles on the popups smaller

305
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:32,170
and that's really that's really key so

306
00:16:32,170 --> 00:16:34,780
now we just look at a few examples of

307
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:37,870
how these how these pop-ups are used

308
00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:42,160
here's here's one this is the red bit

309
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:46,060
the red bit is an acute angle v-fold and

310
00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:48,190
it's got a couple of tabs cut into the

311
00:16:48,190 --> 00:16:51,520
top and that's holding this is raising

312
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:53,290
up this Bluebird so the whole thing

313
00:16:53,290 --> 00:16:57,120
folds down forwards as you close it

314
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:01,900
here's another example this is a this is

315
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:03,550
an acute angle v-fold

316
00:17:03,550 --> 00:17:06,220
raising a figure we've got a couple of

317
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:09,430
counter faults built into the into the

318
00:17:09,430 --> 00:17:11,680
gullies where it where it joins the page

319
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:13,480
and those are what what raised up the

320
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:16,660
arms and we'll just have a look at a

321
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:20,890
couple of a couple of books so this one

322
00:17:20,890 --> 00:17:25,630
is Sergeant charge and in this one if

323
00:17:25,630 --> 00:17:28,590
you look at this this is the the V folds

324
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:31,510
are here you can see there's a V fold

325
00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:34,270
underneath maybe looking at it sideways

326
00:17:34,270 --> 00:17:36,700
on you can see there's a pair of v folds

327
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:39,070
and they're actually raising a whole

328
00:17:39,070 --> 00:17:42,700
series of of parallelograms and the V

329
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:45,010
fold folds away in the direction it's

330
00:17:45,010 --> 00:17:47,860
pointing so the V fold is pointing up

331
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:50,950
the page so as you open it it's pretty

332
00:17:50,950 --> 00:17:52,420
good the way it makes all the figures

333
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:56,530
come down so this is some v-folds used

334
00:17:56,530 --> 00:17:59,950
to raise parallelograms is another

335
00:17:59,950 --> 00:18:04,000
example here this is planes of the Aces

336
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,760
designed by I think it's Keith Mosely

337
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:13,930
and this is a this is that this is the V

338
00:18:13,930 --> 00:18:15,130
fold and

339
00:18:15,130 --> 00:18:17,620
it's raising up this Center plane that

340
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:19,900
the plane is completely made of

341
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:23,169
parallelograms so this is the this is

342
00:18:23,169 --> 00:18:26,490
the v-fold this is the galley the

343
00:18:26,490 --> 00:18:28,630
parallelograms are built into that gully

344
00:18:28,630 --> 00:18:31,150
is a whole array of parallelograms being

345
00:18:31,150 --> 00:18:33,970
raised up up vertically as there as the

346
00:18:33,970 --> 00:18:36,970
page opens and great bit of design that

347
00:18:36,970 --> 00:18:41,980
one and then finally there's a couple

348
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:45,490
here there's some monster islands this

349
00:18:45,490 --> 00:18:48,640
is I think from 1979 or 1980 it's one of

350
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:51,610
the really early sort of second wave of

351
00:18:51,610 --> 00:18:56,549
pop-up books and so this one this is a

352
00:18:56,549 --> 00:19:00,460
this is a spread based on the right

353
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:02,350
angle v-folds and you've got a couple of

354
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:04,390
counter folds at the top here so this

355
00:19:04,390 --> 00:19:06,730
whole bit it could be like that and by

356
00:19:06,730 --> 00:19:10,030
putting these extra extra creases in it

357
00:19:10,030 --> 00:19:12,250
comes down and gives you this extra bit

358
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:15,190
of dimension that's a right angle refold

359
00:19:15,190 --> 00:19:18,070
and then on the next page this is a

360
00:19:18,070 --> 00:19:20,409
acute angle default giving you this

361
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:23,770
monster and the way these arms work

362
00:19:23,770 --> 00:19:25,840
that's all to do with slots we do that

363
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:28,500
in adult another tutorial

364
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:32,230
finally and there's a little book called

365
00:19:32,230 --> 00:19:38,530
pop fill pop fill and the first first

366
00:19:38,530 --> 00:19:41,380
spread it's got a whole lot of these are

367
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:44,049
really tiny v-folds with just one side

368
00:19:44,049 --> 00:19:46,659
projected up to give these these some

369
00:19:46,659 --> 00:19:49,780
tree tops so as you are going to close

370
00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:53,770
