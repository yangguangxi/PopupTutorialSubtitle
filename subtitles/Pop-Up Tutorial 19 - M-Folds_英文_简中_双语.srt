and it's all just a question of design
粘住它的标签已经放好了

34
00:01:27,599 --> 00:01:27,609
and it's all just a question of design
在它后面，这样他们就不会弄乱

35
00:01:27,609 --> 00:01:29,399
and it's all just a question of design
mechanically it doesn't matter which you
设计这是一个EM折叠

36
00:01:29,399 --> 00:01:29,409
mechanically it doesn't matter which you
曾经举起另一架飞机，所以这是

37
00:01:29,409 --> 00:01:35,099
mechanically it doesn't matter which you
do in this example this just shows you
实际上是平行折叠，是弯曲的

38
00:01:35,099 --> 00:01:35,109
do in this example this just shows you
折叠所有的云都做成一个结局

39
00:01:35,109 --> 00:01:37,469
do in this example this just shows you
what you can start doing you can turn
折叠，所以我们拿一张底纸

40
00:01:37,469 --> 00:01:37,479
what you can start doing you can turn
把它弄好一半，然后把一半

41
00:01:37,479 --> 00:01:40,529
what you can start doing you can turn
thee the em fold generates a whole
折叠成两半

series of planes there's six planes but
而我们在这里所做的是

44
00:01:43,319 --> 00:01:43,329
series of planes there's six planes but
我们在教程中看到的基本V折

45
00:01:43,329 --> 00:01:45,719
series of planes there's six planes but
there's also a whole array of gullies as
2，但不同之处在于

46
00:01:45,719 --> 00:01:45,729
there's also a whole array of gullies as
刚开始在底角附近

47
00:01:45,729 --> 00:01:48,690
there's also a whole array of gullies as
well and the gullies you can add counter
并制作两个小的粘合标签

48
00:01:48,690 --> 00:01:48,700
well and the gullies you can add counter
将开始约​​三分之一的方式

49
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:51,270
well and the gullies you can add counter
folds to them like this you can you can
所以这是第一个折痕开始

50
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:51,280
folds to them like this you can you can
大约三分之一

51
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:54,209
folds to them like this you can you can
cut lemons and push pieces through so
向外折痕

52
00:01:54,209 --> 00:01:54,219
cut lemons and push pieces through so
边缘，什么都没关系

53
00:01:54,219 --> 00:01:56,999
cut lemons and push pieces through so
you can use those mountain folds and
角度，你做不同的角度会

54
00:01:56,999 --> 00:01:57,009
you can use those mountain folds and
给你不同的形状，所以如果你想

55
00:01:57,009 --> 00:01:59,160
you can use those mountain folds and
gullies to create a whole lot of more
想玩一个特定的形状

56
00:01:59,160 --> 00:01:59,170
gullies to create a whole lot of more

59
00:02:01,899 --> 00:02:08,309
planes that you can then play around
with this is this bird's this is made
指向箭头那里有折痕

60
00:02:08,309 --> 00:02:08,319
with this is this bird's this is made
现在将它对折，然后切一个楔子

61
00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:10,020
with this is this bird's this is made
with an n-fold it's just a
所有折痕相遇的地方

62
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:10,030
with an n-fold it's just a
之后楔入，所以现在您有了这个

63
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:11,400
with an n-fold it's just a
straightforward n phone
形状，所以现在只需向上折叠一面

64
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:11,410
straightforward n phone
你要增加另一个折痕

65
00:02:11,410 --> 00:02:14,940
straightforward n phone
the tabs that glue it down have been put
这是您的首折，现在

66
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:14,950
the tabs that glue it down have been put
这样上来绝不能从这里开始

67
00:02:14,950 --> 00:02:17,160
the tabs that glue it down have been put
behind it so they don't mess up the
在这一点上，它必须在某个地方

68
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:17,170
behind it so they don't mess up the
沿着这个折线，所以说三分之一

69
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:24,900
behind it so they don't mess up the
design this one this is an EM fold being
的方式，然后将其折叠

70
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:24,910
design this one this is an EM fold being
必须倾斜，所以这是你的

71
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:27,270
design this one this is an EM fold being
used to raise another plane so this is
首先是这种脊椎

72
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:27,280
used to raise another plane so this is
然后

73
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:31,740
used to raise another plane so this is
actually a parallel fold it's a curved
如果倾斜的话要倾斜

74
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:31,750
actually a parallel fold it's a curved
这样就无法工作，然后折叠

75
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:34,560
actually a parallel fold it's a curved
fold all the clouds are made with an end
回到自己那是现在的一侧

现在可以打开它

93
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:13,410
of just starting near the bottom corner
and making two small gluing tabs we're
坚持这样的事情

94
00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:13,420
and making two small gluing tabs we're
必须把这个中央折痕排好

95
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:14,970
and making two small gluing tabs we're
going to start about a third of the way
与中央沟整个事情

96
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:14,980
going to start about a third of the way
当它关闭时，它将向前折叠

97
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:17,490
going to start about a third of the way
up so this is the first crease start
所以你想要的那一边

98
00:03:17,490 --> 00:03:17,500
up so this is the first crease start
页面，您可以在

99
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:19,860

about a third of the way up and you have
返回，如果你想取决于你

100
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:19,870
about a third of the way up and you have
设计，也可以在附近

101
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:22,620
about a third of the way up and you have
a crease coming up towards the outer
前面你也可以很紧

102
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:22,630
a crease coming up towards the outer
所以你有一个非常狭窄的山脊

103
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:24,990
a crease coming up towards the outer
edges and it doesn't really matter what
中间也可以宽一点

104
00:03:24,990 --> 00:03:25,000
edges and it doesn't really matter what
你走得越多，它就会躺下，然后

105
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,170
edges and it doesn't really matter what
angle you do the different angles will
这些是与山褶皱

106
00:03:28,170 --> 00:03:28,180
angle you do the different angles will
他们后面可以玩的沟壑

107
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:29,790
angle you do the different angles will
give you different shapes so if you want
因此，我们可能会尝试

108
00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:29,800
give you different shapes so if you want
在我们坚持之前

109
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:32,460
give you different shapes so if you want
to want to a specific shape just play
所以他们拿第一名，我们就转

110
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:32,470
to want to a specific shape just play
把它放到柜台电话里，以便我们折叠

111
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:34,050
to want to a specific shape just play
around with it till you find the angle
然后将其推回现在

112
00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:34,060
around with it till you find the angle
我们又产生了两架飞机

113
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:39,120
around with it till you find the angle
that you were so here it is open it up
将能够与我们一起玩

114
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:39,130
that you were so here it is open it up
接下来的两个相同，我们可以

115
00:03:39,130 --> 00:03:42,030
that you were so here it is open it up
the creases all make a big downward
将它们折叠起来，你必须这样做

116
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:42,040
the creases all make a big downward
在你坚持下去之前，有很多

117
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:44,180
the creases all make a big downward
pointing arrow there's the creases there
更容易，所以我们在那里

118
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:44,190
pointing arrow there's the creases there
我还有两架飞机，我们可以做

119
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:47,780
pointing arrow there's the creases there
now fold it in half and just cut a wedge
同样在这里，你可以做这些褶皱

120
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:47,790
now fold it in half and just cut a wedge
无论从哪个角度来看都没关系

121
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:50,670
now fold it in half and just cut a wedge
where all the creases meet just cut a
这全都取决于什么

122
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:50,680
where all the creases meet just cut a
塑造你想要的

123
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:54,720
where all the creases meet just cut a
wedge after that so now you have this
幸运的是我们可以离开

124
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:54,730
wedge after that so now you have this
在那，现在把它粘在你身上

125
00:03:54,730 --> 00:03:59,100
wedge after that so now you have this
shape so now just fold up one side and
首先你要决定什么

126
00:03:59,100 --> 00:03:59,110
shape so now just fold up one side and
你想要的角度你有多紧

127
00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:00,570
shape so now just fold up one side and
you're going to add another crease so
想要它站起来你想要多少

128
00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:00,580
you're going to add another crease so
躺着我要去找东西

129
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:03,690
you're going to add another crease so
here's your initial fold now you're
这样，所以前两个折痕

130
00:04:03,690 --> 00:04:03,700
here's your initial fold now you're
到脊椎大约45度

131
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:06,330
here's your initial fold now you're
coming up like this mustn't start here
然后把胶水涂在一侧

132
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:06,340
coming up like this mustn't start here
像这样粘下来就可以了

133
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:08,160
coming up like this mustn't start here
at this point it's got to be somewhere
它关闭把胶水粘在另一个

134
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:08,170
at this point it's got to be somewhere
然后您跟随Shutts折叠

135
00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:11,010
at this point it's got to be somewhere
along this fold line so say a third of
整个基础射击，使其自然

136
00:04:11,010 --> 00:04:11,020
along this fold line so say a third of
粘住位置确实用力按

137
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:14,970
along this fold line so say a third of
the way and then fold it up this fold it
确保你儿子的胶水打开

138
00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:14,980
the way and then fold it up this fold it
它有，我刚刚有你的M折

139
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:17,970
the way and then fold it up this fold it
has to be leaning away so here's your
列举了一些商业案例
