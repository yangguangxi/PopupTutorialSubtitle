00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:39,420
this tutorial is about how to make a

4
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:39,430
this tutorial is about how to make a

5
00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:42,279
this tutorial is about how to make a
moving piece a pull strip which when you

6
00:00:42,279 --> 00:00:42,289
moving piece a pull strip which when you

7
00:00:42,289 --> 00:00:44,229
moving piece a pull strip which when you
pull it it makes a vertical piece slide

8
00:00:44,229 --> 00:00:44,239
pull it it makes a vertical piece slide

9
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:46,209
pull it it makes a vertical piece slide
across the page well I'll show you my

10
00:00:46,209 --> 00:00:46,219
across the page well I'll show you my

version first which is quite simple and

12
00:00:48,430 --> 00:00:48,440
version first which is quite simple and

13
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:52,540
version first which is quite simple and
basic here it is you've got a v-fold and

14
00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:52,550
basic here it is you've got a v-fold and

15
00:00:52,550 --> 00:00:55,779
basic here it is you've got a v-fold and
as you pull the strip it makes a piece

16
00:00:55,779 --> 00:00:55,789
as you pull the strip it makes a piece

17
00:00:55,789 --> 00:00:57,700
as you pull the strip it makes a piece
glide across the page so it's quite

18
00:00:57,700 --> 00:00:57,710
glide across the page so it's quite

19
00:00:57,710 --> 00:00:59,229
glide across the page so it's quite
useful then it's quite a simple

20
00:00:59,229 --> 00:00:59,239
useful then it's quite a simple

63
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:07,680
I've made it with the is going to

00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:07,690
I've made it with the is going to

65
00:02:07,690 --> 00:02:09,090
I've made it with the is going to
be in front of the v-fold

66
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:09,100
be in front of the v-fold

67
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:12,180

you might want to do the behind the

68
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:12,190
you might want to do the behind the

69
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:14,850
you might want to do the behind the
v-fold in which case you'd probably need

70
00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:14,860
v-fold in which case you'd probably need

71
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:17,010

these two tabs to go forwards instead of

72
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:17,020
these two tabs to go forwards instead of

73
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:19,670
these two tabs to go forwards instead of
backwards but I decided to make them go

74
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:19,680
backwards but I decided to make them go

75
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:23,820
backwards but I decided to make them go
backwards out of you so there it is it's

76
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:23,830
backwards out of you so there it is it's

77
00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:25,920
backwards out of you so there it is it's
aligned with that that I've already

78
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:25,930
aligned with that that I've already

79
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:31,010
aligned with that that I've already
cut is about two millimeters wide

80
00:02:31,010 --> 00:02:31,020
cut is about two millimeters wide

81
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:34,380
cut is about two millimeters wide
then we can shut this down close the

82
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:34,390
then we can shut this down close the

83
00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:36,480
then we can shut this down close the
page so it finds its natural sticking

84
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:36,490
page so it finds its natural sticking

85

tutorial one there's that now we're

88
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:44,260
tutorial one there's that now we're

89
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:47,100
tutorial one there's that now we're
going to need a piece in front which is

90
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:47,110
going to need a piece in front which is

91
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:49,530
going to need a piece in front which is
going to hold the moving piece upright

92
00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:49,540
going to hold the moving piece upright

93
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:52,140
going to hold the moving piece upright
so maybe I'll put that on after the

94
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:52,150
so maybe I'll put that on after the

95
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:53,460
so maybe I'll put that on after the
movement this is going to be the moving

that moves it I'll glue this into place

100
00:02:59,370 --> 00:02:59,380
that moves it I'll glue this into place

101
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:01,590
that moves it I'll glue this into place
first so a little bit of glue on the

102
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:01,600
first so a little bit of glue on the

the middle to give it extra strength and

110
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:19,840
the middle to give it extra strength and

111
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:30,060

when you glue these things to put them

116
00:03:35,130 --> 00:03:35,140
when you glue these things to put them

117
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:36,990
when you glue these things to put them
flat and then smooth them out otherwise

118
00:03:36,990 --> 00:03:37,000
flat and then smooth them out otherwise

119
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:42,360
flat and then smooth them out otherwise
they can end up slightly buckled anyway

120
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:42,370
they can end up slightly buckled anyway

121
00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:45,620
they can end up slightly buckled anyway
that's that's now we can slop this

122
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:45,630
that's that's now we can slop this

123
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:52,020
that's that's now we can slop this
through there through the slots in the

just staying upright of its own accord

130
00:03:59,670 --> 00:03:59,680
just staying upright of its own accord

131
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:02,670
just staying upright of its own accord
but just to make sure we'll put another

132
00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:02,680
but just to make sure we'll put another

133
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:07,110
but just to make sure we'll put another
piece in front so I've put a little tab

134
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:07,120
piece in front so I've put a little tab

135
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:10,860
piece in front so I've put a little tab
on one end and then this other end it's

136
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:10,870
on one end and then this other end it's

137
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:13,349
on one end and then this other end it's
going to fit tight into that it doesn't

138
00:04:13,349 --> 00:04:13,359
going to fit tight into that it doesn't

139
00:04:13,359 --> 00:04:16,560
going to fit tight into that it doesn't
need to be this long so I'm going to cut

140
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:16,570
need to be this long so I'm going to cut

141
00:04:16,570 --> 00:04:18,150
need to be this long so I'm going to cut
it off you might want to leave it as

put a little bit of glue there and some

148
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:25,280
put a little bit of glue there and some

149
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:31,330
put a little bit of glue there and some
glue on there be careful with these tabs

150
00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:31,340
glue on there be careful with these tabs

if it's too long it could get in the way

152
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:33,560
if it's too long it could get in the way

153
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:36,490
if it's too long it could get in the way
and start cramping the style at the

154
00:04:36,490 --> 00:04:36,500
and start cramping the style at the

155
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:39,400
and start cramping the style at the
moving piece but I think that would be

156
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:39,410
moving piece but I think that would be

157
00:04:39,410 --> 00:04:43,960
moving piece but I think that would be
okay so now if we pull this you can see

158
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:43,970
okay so now if we pull this you can see

159
00:04:43,970 --> 00:04:45,400
okay so now if we pull this you can see
it moves up and down nicely

160
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:45,410
it moves up and down nicely

161
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:48,580
it moves up and down nicely
you still need another piece behind it

162
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:48,590
you still need another piece behind it

163
00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:51,430
you still need another piece behind it
so keep the strip out flush against the

164
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:51,440
so keep the strip out flush against the

165
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,200
so keep the strip out flush against the
page so I've just got a big piece like

166
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:53,210
page so I've just got a big piece like

167
00:04:53,210 --> 00:05:02,590
page so I've just got a big piece like
this it's slightly too big so that's

168
00:05:02,590 --> 00:05:02,600
this it's slightly too big so that's

169
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,629
this it's slightly too big so that's
going to stick on like that so you just

170
00:05:04,629 --> 00:05:04,639
going to stick on like that so you just

171
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:07,840
going to stick on like that so you just
need a thin bead of glue along each edge

172
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:07,850
need a thin bead of glue along each edge

173
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:09,909
need a thin bead of glue along each edge
to be careful but it doesn't lose

174
00:05:09,909 --> 00:05:09,919
to be careful but it doesn't lose

175
00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:12,159
to be careful but it doesn't lose
underneath the strip and gum everything

176
00:05:12,159 --> 00:05:12,169
underneath the strip and gum everything

177
00:05:12,169 --> 00:05:14,890
underneath the strip and gum everything
up so just put a very little boost on

178
00:05:14,890 --> 00:05:14,900
up so just put a very little boost on

179
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:19,689
up so just put a very little boost on
each side of it there like that smear it

180
00:05:19,689 --> 00:05:19,699
each side of it there like that smear it

181
00:05:19,699 --> 00:05:35,260
each side of it there like that smear it
nicely let's see yeah you might want to

182
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:35,270
nicely let's see yeah you might want to

183
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:36,820
nicely let's see yeah you might want to
play around with the end you could

184
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:36,830
play around with the end you could

185
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:39,580
play around with the end you could
either cut it off or you might you could

186
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:39,590
either cut it off or you might you could

187
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:41,950
either cut it off or you might you could
cut it off anyway cut it off like that

188
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:41,960
cut it off anyway cut it off like that

189
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:44,860
cut it off anyway cut it off like that
so you might want to a little curve

190
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:44,870
so you might want to a little curve

191
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:48,610
so you might want to a little curve
there so you can cut it off flush with

192
00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:48,620
there so you can cut it off flush with

193
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:52,360
there so you can cut it off flush with
the page and and still be able to get

194
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:52,370
the page and and still be able to get

195
00:05:52,370 --> 00:05:56,070
the page and and still be able to get
hold of it

196
00:05:56,070 --> 00:05:56,080


197
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:59,680
there is the the sliding vertical image

198
00:05:59,680 --> 00:05:59,690
there is the the sliding vertical image

199
00:05:59,690 --> 00:06:02,200
there is the the sliding vertical image
of course you could put out Suzy's one

200
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:02,210
of course you could put out Suzy's one

201
00:06:02,210 --> 00:06:03,790
of course you could put out Suzy's one
one behind the other and you can

202
00:06:03,790 --> 00:06:03,800
one behind the other and you can

203
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,200
one behind the other and you can
probably if you're clever enough you can

204
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:05,210
probably if you're clever enough you can

205
00:06:05,210 --> 00:06:07,000
probably if you're clever enough you can
put them all working off one pull strip

206
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:07,010
put them all working off one pull strip

207
00:06:07,010 --> 00:06:08,830
put them all working off one pull strip
but I'll need you to work that out for

208
00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:08,840
but I'll need you to work that out for

209
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:09,410
but I'll need you to work that out for
yourselves

210
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:09,420
yourselves
