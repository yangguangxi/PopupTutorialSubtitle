00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:10,840
which can be built into this one is a
parallel fold again we've got extra

18
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:10,850
parallel fold again we've got extra

19
00:01:10,850 --> 00:01:12,880
parallel fold again we've got extra
creases which create another gully that

20
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:12,890
creases which create another gully that

21
00:01:12,890 --> 00:01:15,219
creases which create another gully that
you can build into also creates extra

22
00:01:15,219 --> 00:01:15,229
you can build into also creates extra

23
00:01:15,229 --> 00:01:20,140

again this is a basic V folds and in

26
00:01:22,899 --> 00:01:22,909
again this is a basic V folds and in

27
00:01:22,909 --> 00:01:25,510
again this is a basic V folds and in
this case the the extra creases rather

28
00:01:25,510 --> 00:01:25,520
this case the the extra creases rather

29
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:27,850
this case the the extra creases rather
than being used to create the gully like

30
00:01:27,850 --> 00:01:27,860
than being used to create the gully like

31
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:29,980
than being used to create the gully like
in this one they've been trimmed down to

32
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:29,990
in this one they've been trimmed down to

33
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:32,469
in this one they've been trimmed down to
create two tabs and that's lifting it

34
00:01:32,469 --> 00:01:32,479
create two tabs and that's lifting it

35
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:36,310
create two tabs and that's lifting it
another hole pair of planes which again

36
00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:36,320
another hole pair of planes which again

37
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:38,560
another hole pair of planes which again
creates another gully that you can think

38
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:38,570
creates another gully that you can think

39
00:01:38,570 --> 00:01:40,990
creates another gully that you can think
of build on so let's just start by

40
00:01:40,990 --> 00:01:41,000
of build on so let's just start by

41
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:46,670
of build on so let's just start by
building one of these

42
00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:46,680


43
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:52,940
so we take a base sheet fold it in half

44
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:52,950


45
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:56,640
no need to measure no need to score with

46
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:56,650
no need to measure no need to score with

47
00:01:56,650 --> 00:02:00,720
no need to measure no need to score with
this type of card this is 160 GSM

48
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:00,730
this type of card this is 160 GSM

49
00:02:00,730 --> 00:02:03,120
this type of card this is 160 GSM
photocopy card so it's really easy to

50
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:03,130
photocopy card so it's really easy to

51
00:02:03,130 --> 00:02:05,490
photocopy card so it's really easy to
fold just crease it really really

52
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:05,500
fold just crease it really really

53
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:08,160
fold just crease it really really
thoroughly fold it back on itself a few

54
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:08,170
thoroughly fold it back on itself a few

55
00:02:08,170 --> 00:02:14,310
thoroughly fold it back on itself a few
times crimp it again and again that's

56
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:14,320
times crimp it again and again that's

57
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:16,820
times crimp it again and again that's
your base sheet that would take a

58
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:16,830
your base sheet that would take a

59
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:23,690
your base sheet that would take a
another piece of card to make the pop-up

60
00:02:23,690 --> 00:02:23,700


61
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:26,820
so we just take about a third of the

62
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:26,830
so we just take about a third of the

63
00:02:26,830 --> 00:02:32,040
so we just take about a third of the
card just just by eye just roughly the

64
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:32,050
card just just by eye just roughly the

65
00:02:32,050 --> 00:02:41,700
card just just by eye just roughly the
folded card fold it in half crease it

66
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:41,710
folded card fold it in half crease it

67
00:02:41,710 --> 00:02:47,040
folded card fold it in half crease it
really thoroughly and then refold you

68
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:47,050
really thoroughly and then refold you

69
00:02:47,050 --> 00:02:49,740
really thoroughly and then refold you
want two creases coming up at an angle

70
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:49,750
want two creases coming up at an angle

71
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:52,050
want two creases coming up at an angle
so we start this is the folded line

72
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:52,060
so we start this is the folded line

73
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:54,860
so we start this is the folded line
start about half an inch above the base

74
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:54,870
start about half an inch above the base

75
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:58,890
start about half an inch above the base
fold it up at an angle crease it really

76
00:02:58,890 --> 00:02:58,900
fold it up at an angle crease it really

77
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:03,800
fold it up at an angle crease it really
well and fold it back on itself

78
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:03,810


79
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:08,610
you can cut cut that corner out cut this

80
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:08,620
you can cut cut that corner out cut this

81
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:14,699
you can cut cut that corner out cut this
to make a couple of tabs trim off those

82
00:03:14,699 --> 00:03:14,709
to make a couple of tabs trim off those

83
00:03:14,709 --> 00:03:17,250
to make a couple of tabs trim off those
corners just for neatness and so here we

84
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:17,260
corners just for neatness and so here we

85
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:22,080
corners just for neatness and so here we
have the basic basic v-fold pop-up shape

86
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:22,090
have the basic basic v-fold pop-up shape

87
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:24,750
have the basic basic v-fold pop-up shape
the the creases all make a downward

88
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:24,760
the the creases all make a downward

89
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:28,050
the the creases all make a downward
pointing arrow now you've got a choice

90
00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:28,060
pointing arrow now you've got a choice

91
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:29,870
pointing arrow now you've got a choice
we're going to add two more creases

92
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:29,880
we're going to add two more creases

93
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:32,610
we're going to add two more creases
basically they they roughly follow the

94
00:03:32,610 --> 00:03:32,620
basically they they roughly follow the

95
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:35,370
basically they they roughly follow the
the line of that one you can make it

96
00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:35,380
the line of that one you can make it

97
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:37,350
the line of that one you can make it
absolutely parallel or you can make it a

98
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:37,360
absolutely parallel or you can make it a

99
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,900
absolutely parallel or you can make it a
bit coming down a bit more steeply this

100
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:39,910
bit coming down a bit more steeply this

101
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:44,060
bit coming down a bit more steeply this
is the original fold so we fold it over

102
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:44,070
is the original fold so we fold it over

103
00:03:44,070 --> 00:03:49,520
is the original fold so we fold it over
crease it well fold it back on itself

104
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:49,530


105
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:52,530
open it up and now this will fold back

106
00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:52,540
open it up and now this will fold back

107
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:53,559
open it up and now this will fold back
down

108
00:03:53,559 --> 00:03:53,569
down

109
00:03:53,569 --> 00:03:57,339
down
so when we stick this onto the page this

110
00:03:57,339 --> 00:03:57,349
so when we stick this onto the page this

111
00:03:57,349 --> 00:03:59,979
so when we stick this onto the page this
is what we're going to get and again as

112
00:03:59,979 --> 00:03:59,989
is what we're going to get and again as

113
00:03:59,989 --> 00:04:03,369
is what we're going to get and again as
we know v40 can play with the play with

114
00:04:03,369 --> 00:04:03,379
we know v40 can play with the play with

115
00:04:03,379 --> 00:04:05,199
we know v40 can play with the play with
the angle of the piece on the page as

116
00:04:05,199 --> 00:04:05,209
the angle of the piece on the page as

117
00:04:05,209 --> 00:04:07,599
the angle of the piece on the page as
you as you make it tighter than the

118
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:07,609
you as you make it tighter than the

119
00:04:07,609 --> 00:04:09,429
you as you make it tighter than the
Guddi that you've created the extra

120
00:04:09,429 --> 00:04:09,439
Guddi that you've created the extra

121
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:12,670
Guddi that you've created the extra
gunny folds points back down low or as

122
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:12,680
gunny folds points back down low or as

123
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:15,369
gunny folds points back down low or as
you go wider the gully lifts up so you

124
00:04:15,369 --> 00:04:15,379
you go wider the gully lifts up so you

125
00:04:15,379 --> 00:04:17,560
you go wider the gully lifts up so you
can play with the angles on these folds

126
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:17,570
can play with the angles on these folds

127
00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:20,650
can play with the angles on these folds
and it it affects the overall shape so

128
00:04:20,650 --> 00:04:20,660
and it it affects the overall shape so

129
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:22,439
and it it affects the overall shape so
we'll start by just gluing this down

130
00:04:22,439 --> 00:04:22,449
we'll start by just gluing this down

131
00:04:22,449 --> 00:04:26,230
we'll start by just gluing this down
I'll just cut these a bit more a little

132
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:26,240
I'll just cut these a bit more a little

133
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,120
I'll just cut these a bit more a little
sharper so they don't overlap on the

134
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:28,130
sharper so they don't overlap on the

135
00:04:28,130 --> 00:04:32,020
sharper so they don't overlap on the
spine and so we've got symmetry on the

136
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:32,030
spine and so we've got symmetry on the

137
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:34,659
spine and so we've got symmetry on the
pop-up the angles between the central

138
00:04:34,659 --> 00:04:34,669
pop-up the angles between the central

139
00:04:34,669 --> 00:04:36,700
pop-up the angles between the central
crease and the creases on the gluing

140
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:36,710
crease and the creases on the gluing

141
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:39,010
crease and the creases on the gluing
tabs they're both the same each side and

142
00:04:39,010 --> 00:04:39,020
tabs they're both the same each side and

143
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:41,980
tabs they're both the same each side and
now we want symmetry on on the base and

144
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:41,990
now we want symmetry on on the base and

145
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:43,960
now we want symmetry on on the base and
being a v-fold this will fold down in

146
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:43,970
being a v-fold this will fold down in

147
00:04:43,970 --> 00:04:45,999
being a v-fold this will fold down in
the direction that the vias pointing so

148
00:04:45,999 --> 00:04:46,009
the direction that the vias pointing so

149
00:04:46,009 --> 00:04:49,120
the direction that the vias pointing so
this will fold down like this so to get

150
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:49,130
this will fold down like this so to get

151
00:04:49,130 --> 00:04:51,490
this will fold down like this so to get
the symmetry we just just glue one side

152
00:04:51,490 --> 00:04:51,500
the symmetry we just just glue one side

153
00:04:51,500 --> 00:05:04,820
the symmetry we just just glue one side
first

00:05:30,110 --> 00:05:30,120
put glue on the other tab smear the glue

169
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:35,510
put glue on the other tab smear the glue
to the the up to the crease and then

170
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:35,520
to the the up to the crease and then

171
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:41,110
to the the up to the crease and then
fold the page shut

172
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:41,120


173
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:44,750
so here here we have this this V fold

174
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:44,760
so here here we have this this V fold

175
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:46,780
so here here we have this this V fold
now has an extra guard created on top

176
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:46,790
now has an extra guard created on top

177
00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:49,670

you like and you're starting to actually

190
00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:12,060
you like and you're starting to actually

191
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:14,480
you like and you're starting to actually
sculpt with this shape so I'll just glue

192
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:14,490
sculpt with this shape so I'll just glue

193
00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:27,019
sculpt with this shape so I'll just glue
that one in

194
00:06:27,019 --> 00:06:27,029


195
00:06:27,029 --> 00:06:30,389
so put it in and as you build with as

196
00:06:30,389 --> 00:06:30,399
so put it in and as you build with as

197
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:32,760
so put it in and as you build with as
you build with pop-ups every time you

198
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:32,770
you build with pop-ups every time you

199
00:06:32,770 --> 00:06:35,639
you build with pop-ups every time you
add a piece close the base and press it

200
00:06:35,639 --> 00:06:35,649
add a piece close the base and press it

201
00:06:35,649 --> 00:06:38,549
add a piece close the base and press it
firmly so as you go step by step you're

202
00:06:38,549 --> 00:06:38,559
firmly so as you go step by step you're

203
00:06:38,559 --> 00:06:40,290
firmly so as you go step by step you're
sure that the whole structure is sound

204
00:06:40,290 --> 00:06:40,300
sure that the whole structure is sound

205
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:42,959
sure that the whole structure is sound
that it's but it's working that it fits

206
00:06:42,959 --> 00:06:42,969
that it's but it's working that it fits

207
00:06:42,969 --> 00:06:46,290
that it's but it's working that it fits
in that the phones work but the that the

208
00:06:46,290 --> 00:06:46,300
in that the phones work but the that the

209
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:48,869
in that the phones work but the that the
gluing is working and this in this case

210
00:06:48,869 --> 00:06:48,879
gluing is working and this in this case

211
00:06:48,879 --> 00:06:50,329
gluing is working and this in this case
we might as well just add another

212
00:06:50,329 --> 00:06:50,339
we might as well just add another

213
00:06:50,339 --> 00:06:53,730
we might as well just add another
another little them parallel fold on top

214
00:06:53,730 --> 00:06:53,740
another little them parallel fold on top

215
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:59,369
another little them parallel fold on top
of that so you can scatter just another

216
00:06:59,369 --> 00:06:59,379
of that so you can scatter just another

217
00:06:59,379 --> 00:07:04,379
of that so you can scatter just another
piece of card fold it in half add a

couple of tabs trim them this is going

220
00:07:18,659 --> 00:07:18,669
couple of tabs trim them this is going

221
00:07:18,669 --> 00:07:20,309
couple of tabs trim them this is going
to fit into that gully that we've just

222
00:07:20,309 --> 00:07:20,319
to fit into that gully that we've just

223
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:26,219
to fit into that gully that we've just
created so she's going to fit in like

224
00:07:26,219 --> 00:07:26,229
created so she's going to fit in like

225
00:07:26,229 --> 00:07:31,079
created so she's going to fit in like
this so you just put a bit of glue on on

226
00:07:31,079 --> 00:07:31,089
this so you just put a bit of glue on on

227
00:07:31,089 --> 00:07:35,639
this so you just put a bit of glue on on
one tab smear it to the edges a little

228
00:07:35,639 --> 00:07:35,649
one tab smear it to the edges a little

229
00:07:35,649 --> 00:07:38,040
one tab smear it to the edges a little
bit this is a parallel fold so it's got

230
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:38,050
bit this is a parallel fold so it's got

231
00:07:38,050 --> 00:07:40,619
bit this is a parallel fold so it's got
everything's got to be parallel with the

232
00:07:40,619 --> 00:07:40,629
everything's got to be parallel with the

233
00:07:40,629 --> 00:07:45,469
everything's got to be parallel with the
crease in the gully stick it into place

234
00:07:45,469 --> 00:07:45,479
crease in the gully stick it into place

235
00:07:45,479 --> 00:07:54,769
crease in the gully stick it into place
put glue on the other tab smear the glue

236
00:07:54,769 --> 00:07:54,779
put glue on the other tab smear the glue

237
00:07:54,779 --> 00:07:57,449
put glue on the other tab smear the glue
fold the whole piece shut so it finds

238
00:07:57,449 --> 00:07:57,459
fold the whole piece shut so it finds

239
00:07:57,459 --> 00:08:04,169
fold the whole piece shut so it finds
its natural natural sticking position so

240
00:08:04,169 --> 00:08:04,179
its natural natural sticking position so

241
00:08:04,179 --> 00:08:06,540
its natural natural sticking position so
here it is it's a basic V fold with

242
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:06,550
here it is it's a basic V fold with

243
00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:08,819
here it is it's a basic V fold with
added creases which is then lifting up

244
00:08:08,819 --> 00:08:08,829
added creases which is then lifting up

245
00:08:08,829 --> 00:08:10,609
added creases which is then lifting up
two more planes which has then got a

246
00:08:10,609 --> 00:08:10,619
two more planes which has then got a

247
00:08:10,619 --> 00:08:13,169
two more planes which has then got a
parallel fold stuck into the top of it

248
00:08:13,169 --> 00:08:13,179
parallel fold stuck into the top of it

249
00:08:13,179 --> 00:08:15,899
parallel fold stuck into the top of it
so you can you can look at this either

250
00:08:15,899 --> 00:08:15,909
so you can you can look at this either

251
00:08:15,909 --> 00:08:19,199
so you can you can look at this either
with the pop-up the base sheet of the

252
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:19,209
with the pop-up the base sheet of the

253
00:08:19,209 --> 00:08:21,839
with the pop-up the base sheet of the
base with the pop-up rising from it or

254
00:08:21,839 --> 00:08:21,849
base with the pop-up rising from it or

255
00:08:21,849 --> 00:08:23,369
base with the pop-up rising from it or
you can look at it like this so this is

256
00:08:23,369 --> 00:08:23,379
you can look at it like this so this is

257
00:08:23,379 --> 00:08:25,199
you can look at it like this so this is
the base sheet as a background did the

258
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:25,209
the base sheet as a background did the

259
00:08:25,209 --> 00:08:27,629
the base sheet as a background did the
pop-up coming forward from it all we've

260
00:08:27,629 --> 00:08:27,639
pop-up coming forward from it all we've

261
00:08:27,639 --> 00:08:29,939
pop-up coming forward from it all we've
made here is an abstract shape it's just

262
00:08:29,939 --> 00:08:29,949
made here is an abstract shape it's just

263
00:08:29,949 --> 00:08:31,879
made here is an abstract shape it's just
playing playing with the sculpture

264
00:08:31,879 --> 00:08:31,889
playing playing with the sculpture

265
00:08:31,889 --> 00:08:34,519
playing playing with the sculpture
and again now you've actually from the

266
00:08:34,519 --> 00:08:34,529
and again now you've actually from the

267
00:08:34,529 --> 00:08:35,810
and again now you've actually from the
original v-fold

268
00:08:35,810 --> 00:08:35,820
original v-fold

269
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:38,149
original v-fold
that was two planes you've now actually

270
00:08:38,149 --> 00:08:38,159
that was two planes you've now actually

271
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:41,449
that was two planes you've now actually
got six planes and so any of these can

272
00:08:41,449 --> 00:08:41,459
got six planes and so any of these can

273
00:08:41,459 --> 00:08:43,790
got six planes and so any of these can
be extended you can come up off the blue

274
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:43,800
be extended you can come up off the blue

275
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:46,100
be extended you can come up off the blue
one you can come up off the second gully

276
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:46,110
one you can come up off the second gully

277
00:08:46,110 --> 00:08:49,190
one you can come up off the second gully
where you can come up come off the of

278
00:08:49,190 --> 00:08:49,200
where you can come up come off the of

279
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:52,430
where you can come up come off the of
the parallel fold this all just abstract

280
00:08:52,430 --> 00:08:52,440
the parallel fold this all just abstract

281
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:54,829
the parallel fold this all just abstract
at this point and it's just yeah use

282
00:08:54,829 --> 00:08:54,839
at this point and it's just yeah use

283
00:08:54,839 --> 00:08:56,930
at this point and it's just yeah use
your imagination see where you want to

284
00:08:56,930 --> 00:08:56,940
your imagination see where you want to

285
00:08:56,940 --> 00:09:00,650
your imagination see where you want to
go the other way you can play with this

286
00:09:00,650 --> 00:09:00,660
go the other way you can play with this

287
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:04,220
go the other way you can play with this
is that rather than creating two planes

288
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:04,230
is that rather than creating two planes

289
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:10,910
is that rather than creating two planes
with a gully you can create flaps so

290
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:10,920
with a gully you can create flaps so

291
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:12,740
with a gully you can create flaps so
I'll just make one of those to show you

292
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:12,750
I'll just make one of those to show you

293
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:16,550
I'll just make one of those to show you
how that works take a piece of card fold

294
00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:16,560
how that works take a piece of card fold

295
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:20,810
how that works take a piece of card fold
it in half crease it really well really

296
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:20,820
it in half crease it really well really

297
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:23,240
it in half crease it really well really
crimp the creases fold them back on

298
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:23,250
crimp the creases fold them back on

299
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:30,710
crimp the creases fold them back on
themselves crimp them again and again so

300
00:09:30,710 --> 00:09:30,720
themselves crimp them again and again so

301
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:33,199
themselves crimp them again and again so
this is your base sheet now we'll build

302
00:09:33,199 --> 00:09:33,209
this is your base sheet now we'll build

303
00:09:33,209 --> 00:09:38,530
this is your base sheet now we'll build
onto that it's pretty cold here so just

304
00:09:38,530 --> 00:09:38,540
onto that it's pretty cold here so just

305
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:43,160
onto that it's pretty cold here so just
take the piece of cards no measuring

306
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:43,170
take the piece of cards no measuring

307
00:09:43,170 --> 00:09:45,980
take the piece of cards no measuring
just cut it by eye you know whatever

308
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:45,990
just cut it by eye you know whatever

309
00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:52,579
just cut it by eye you know whatever
size you month fold it in half crease it

310
00:09:52,579 --> 00:09:52,589
size you month fold it in half crease it

311
00:09:52,589 --> 00:09:56,389
size you month fold it in half crease it
really well fold it back on itself crimp

312
00:09:56,389 --> 00:09:56,399
really well fold it back on itself crimp

313
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:59,449
really well fold it back on itself crimp
it down again and then we're making a

314
00:09:59,449 --> 00:09:59,459
it down again and then we're making a

315
00:09:59,459 --> 00:10:02,000
it down again and then we're making a
basic V fold so this is the fold line

316
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:02,010
basic V fold so this is the fold line

317
00:10:02,010 --> 00:10:04,759
basic V fold so this is the fold line
starting about half an inch up you fold

318
00:10:04,759 --> 00:10:04,769
starting about half an inch up you fold

319
00:10:04,769 --> 00:10:07,040
starting about half an inch up you fold
it up at an angle away from the away

320
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:07,050
it up at an angle away from the away

321
00:10:07,050 --> 00:10:09,410
it up at an angle away from the away
from the central fold fold it back on

322
00:10:09,410 --> 00:10:09,420
from the central fold fold it back on

323
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:12,920
from the central fold fold it back on
itself and you open this up

324
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:12,930
itself and you open this up

325
00:10:12,930 --> 00:10:14,540
itself and you open this up
you've got the basic V fold design

326
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:14,550
you've got the basic V fold design

327
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:17,090
you've got the basic V fold design
you've got the all the creases make it

328
00:10:17,090 --> 00:10:17,100
you've got the all the creases make it

329
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:19,490
you've got the all the creases make it
downward pointing arrow so now we'll

330
00:10:19,490 --> 00:10:19,500
downward pointing arrow so now we'll

331
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:23,180
downward pointing arrow so now we'll
just trim that to make gluing tabs for

332
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:23,190
just trim that to make gluing tabs for

333
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:29,840
just trim that to make gluing tabs for
the v-fold trim that a bit more sharp so

334
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:29,850
the v-fold trim that a bit more sharp so

335
00:10:29,850 --> 00:10:33,050
the v-fold trim that a bit more sharp so
it won't overlap and spine so this is

336
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:33,060
it won't overlap and spine so this is

337
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:35,600
it won't overlap and spine so this is
your basic V fold piece now let's make a

338
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:35,610
your basic V fold piece now let's make a

339
00:10:35,610 --> 00:10:36,790
your basic V fold piece now let's make a
phone at the top

340
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:36,800
phone at the top

341
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:41,380
phone at the top
so come in like this this up this time

342
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:41,390
so come in like this this up this time

343
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:43,360
so come in like this this up this time
I've got more or less parallel with the

344
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:43,370
I've got more or less parallel with the

345
00:10:43,370 --> 00:10:46,300
I've got more or less parallel with the
with the original ones you can come in

346
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:46,310
with the original ones you can come in

347
00:10:46,310 --> 00:10:48,310
with the original ones you can come in
more or less at any angle whatever angle

348
00:10:48,310 --> 00:10:48,320
more or less at any angle whatever angle

349
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,350
more or less at any angle whatever angle
you come in at it'll affect the shape

350
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:50,360
you come in at it'll affect the shape

351
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:52,030
you come in at it'll affect the shape
that you make but there's no right

352
00:10:52,030 --> 00:10:52,040
that you make but there's no right

353
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:54,970
that you make but there's no right
there's no wrong in this case I want the

354
00:10:54,970 --> 00:10:54,980
there's no wrong in this case I want the

355
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:57,069
there's no wrong in this case I want the
top to be slightly narrower so I'm going

356
00:10:57,069 --> 00:10:57,079
top to be slightly narrower so I'm going

357
00:10:57,079 --> 00:11:00,699
top to be slightly narrower so I'm going
to trim this down coming from the corner

358
00:11:00,699 --> 00:11:00,709
to trim this down coming from the corner

359
00:11:00,709 --> 00:11:04,780
to trim this down coming from the corner
I'm going to cut in like that and then

360
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:04,790
I'm going to cut in like that and then

361
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:07,569
I'm going to cut in like that and then
I'm going to trim these into two more

362
00:11:07,569 --> 00:11:07,579
I'm going to trim these into two more

363
00:11:07,579 --> 00:11:13,180
I'm going to trim these into two more
tabs so now we've got a v-fold with tabs

364
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:13,190
tabs so now we've got a v-fold with tabs

365
00:11:13,190 --> 00:11:17,949
tabs so now we've got a v-fold with tabs
at the top so we fold fold fold down in

366
00:11:17,949 --> 00:11:17,959
at the top so we fold fold fold down in

367
00:11:17,959 --> 00:11:19,780
at the top so we fold fold fold down in
the direction they're pointing so we

368
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:19,790
the direction they're pointing so we

369
00:11:19,790 --> 00:11:21,310
the direction they're pointing so we
want this to be up near the top of your

370
00:11:21,310 --> 00:11:21,320
want this to be up near the top of your

371
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:24,310
want this to be up near the top of your
page we've got symmetry so the two

372
00:11:24,310 --> 00:11:24,320
page we've got symmetry so the two

373
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,230
page we've got symmetry so the two
angles on each side of the central fold

374
00:11:26,230 --> 00:11:26,240
angles on each side of the central fold

375
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:28,210
angles on each side of the central fold
are both the same on this pop-up piece

376
00:11:28,210 --> 00:11:28,220
are both the same on this pop-up piece

377
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:32,590
are both the same on this pop-up piece
now we want symmetry on the page so take

378
00:11:32,590 --> 00:11:32,600
now we want symmetry on the page so take

379
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:34,840
now we want symmetry on the page so take
the glue just put glue on one tab to

380
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:34,850
the glue just put glue on one tab to

381
00:11:34,850 --> 00:11:44,680
the glue just put glue on one tab to
start off with then work out when you

382
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:44,690
start off with then work out when you

383
00:11:44,690 --> 00:11:46,840
start off with then work out when you
want a really sharp shape or a wider one

384
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:46,850
want a really sharp shape or a wider one

385
00:11:46,850 --> 00:11:49,750
want a really sharp shape or a wider one
I'm going at roughly 45 degrees but

386
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:49,760
I'm going at roughly 45 degrees but

387
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,639
I'm going at roughly 45 degrees but
again it doesn't matter it just depends

388
00:11:51,639 --> 00:11:51,649
again it doesn't matter it just depends

389
00:11:51,649 --> 00:11:54,750
again it doesn't matter it just depends
depends what shape you want to create

390
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:54,760
depends what shape you want to create

391
00:11:54,760 --> 00:12:04,740
depends what shape you want to create
now put glue on the other tab

392
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:04,750


393
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:16,000
and close it down so here we've got a

394
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:16,010
and close it down so here we've got a

395
00:12:16,010 --> 00:12:18,610
and close it down so here we've got a
v-fold with a pair of tabs on the top

396
00:12:18,610 --> 00:12:18,620
v-fold with a pair of tabs on the top

397
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:21,910
v-fold with a pair of tabs on the top
and you can build into this so you take

398
00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:21,920
and you can build into this so you take

399
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:24,760
and you can build into this so you take
another piece fold it in half

400
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:24,770
another piece fold it in half

401
00:12:24,770 --> 00:12:27,699
another piece fold it in half
I might actually prefer it long way so

402
00:12:27,699 --> 00:12:27,709
I might actually prefer it long way so

403
00:12:27,709 --> 00:12:36,780
I might actually prefer it long way so
now I fold it in half crease it well and

404
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:36,790
now I fold it in half crease it well and

405
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:40,480
now I fold it in half crease it well and
this piece where as in this one we made

406
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:40,490
this piece where as in this one we made

407
00:12:40,490 --> 00:12:43,180
this piece where as in this one we made
before because you are working working

408
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:43,190
before because you are working working

409
00:12:43,190 --> 00:12:46,000
before because you are working working
with a gully you can only make these

410
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:46,010
with a gully you can only make these

411
00:12:46,010 --> 00:12:49,600
with a gully you can only make these
pieces jut out that the angles created

412
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:49,610
pieces jut out that the angles created

413
00:12:49,610 --> 00:12:53,110
pieces jut out that the angles created
by the gully in this case because you've

414
00:12:53,110 --> 00:12:53,120
by the gully in this case because you've

415
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:55,150
by the gully in this case because you've
got tabs you can actually see saris

416
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:55,160
got tabs you can actually see saris

417
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:56,769
got tabs you can actually see saris
around so you may choose to have it

418
00:12:56,769 --> 00:12:56,779
around so you may choose to have it

419
00:12:56,779 --> 00:12:59,350
around so you may choose to have it
coming up really steep or you may choose

420
00:12:59,350 --> 00:12:59,360
coming up really steep or you may choose

421
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:02,769
coming up really steep or you may choose
to have it it can even be pointing down

422
00:13:02,769 --> 00:13:02,779
to have it it can even be pointing down

423
00:13:02,779 --> 00:13:05,769
to have it it can even be pointing down
this way and the tabs and will stick

424
00:13:05,769 --> 00:13:05,779
this way and the tabs and will stick

425
00:13:05,779 --> 00:13:08,590
this way and the tabs and will stick
onto it there so you can just see sorry

426
00:13:08,590 --> 00:13:08,600
onto it there so you can just see sorry

427
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:10,449
onto it there so you can just see sorry
surround and decide what shape you want

428
00:13:10,449 --> 00:13:10,459
surround and decide what shape you want

429
00:13:10,459 --> 00:13:13,120
surround and decide what shape you want
and then in this case you don't glue one

430
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:13,130
and then in this case you don't glue one

431
00:13:13,130 --> 00:13:15,850
and then in this case you don't glue one
tab and then the other you put put glue

432
00:13:15,850 --> 00:13:15,860
tab and then the other you put put glue

433
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:18,610
tab and then the other you put put glue
on both tabs at the same time so we put

434
00:13:18,610 --> 00:13:18,620
on both tabs at the same time so we put

435
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:24,790
on both tabs at the same time so we put
the glue on both the tabs smear it to

436
00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:24,800
the glue on both the tabs smear it to

437
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:34,060
the glue on both the tabs smear it to
the edges

438
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:34,070


439
00:13:34,070 --> 00:13:36,590
beside what angle you want it on really

440
00:13:36,590 --> 00:13:36,600
beside what angle you want it on really

441
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:39,170
beside what angle you want it on really
I'm gonna go more or less horizontal and

442
00:13:39,170 --> 00:13:39,180
I'm gonna go more or less horizontal and

443
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:47,950
I'm gonna go more or less horizontal and
you just fold the whole piece down so

444
00:13:47,950 --> 00:13:47,960
you just fold the whole piece down so

445
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:51,410
you just fold the whole piece down so
there we have it and again you can you

446
00:13:51,410 --> 00:13:51,420
there we have it and again you can you

447
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:53,720

you in terms of making things there's

473
00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:27,860
you in terms of making things there's
quite a nice one here this is the same

474
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:27,870
quite a nice one here this is the same

475
00:14:27,870 --> 00:14:31,310
quite a nice one here this is the same
idea but this is a this is a v-fold the

476
00:14:31,310 --> 00:14:31,320
idea but this is a this is a v-fold the

477

00:14:33,950 --> 00:14:33,960
red v-fold lifting up the Bluebirds so

479
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:36,280
red v-fold lifting up the Bluebirds so
that's just like the piece we just made
