1
00:00:33,929 --> 00:00:36,869
this tutorial is about open top shapes
本教程是关于开顶形状的

2
00:00:36,869 --> 00:00:36,879
this tutorial is about open top shapes
有很多配置，所以

3
00:00:36,879 --> 00:00:40,130
this tutorial is about open top shapes
there are a number of configurations so
这是最基础的

4
00:00:40,130 --> 00:00:40,140
there are a number of configurations so
基于此处的平行折叠

5
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:43,079
there are a number of configurations so
this is the most the most basic it's
在这里，这个姐姐在T型链上折起来

6
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:43,089
this is the most the most basic it's
其实只是

7
00:00:43,089 --> 00:00:45,509
this is the most the most basic it's
based on a parallel fold stuck down here
一端的标签将其粘成一个循环

8
00:00:45,509 --> 00:00:45,519
based on a parallel fold stuck down here
然后在这个下一个例子

9
00:00:45,519 --> 00:00:48,540
based on a parallel fold stuck down here
and here this sister fold at the T chain
如果是同一件事，那是一条

10
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:48,550
and here this sister fold at the T chain
一端带有标签的卡片

11
00:00:48,550 --> 00:00:50,819
and here this sister fold at the T chain
it's really just the strip of card with
进入循环，但在这种情况下，标签

12
00:00:50,819 --> 00:00:50,829
it's really just the strip of card with
将其附加到页面上的孔

13
00:00:50,829 --> 00:00:53,039
it's really just the strip of card with
a tab on one end gluing it into a loop
每边都有一个折痕

14
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:53,049
a tab on one end gluing it into a loop
在每个角落上方，然后您需要

15
00:00:53,049 --> 00:01:00,449
a tab on one end gluing it into a loop
and then stuck down next example in this
另一个折痕上方的两个折痕

16
00:01:00,449 --> 00:01:00,459
and then stuck down next example in this
基本折，所以这是一个

17
00:01:00,459 --> 00:01:02,819
and then stuck down next example in this
case it's the same thing it's a strip of
类似的想法，这是一个正方形，但在

18
00:01:02,819 --> 00:01:02,829
case it's the same thing it's a strip of
这种情况是基于v折

19
00:01:02,829 --> 00:01:05,189
case it's the same thing it's a strip of
card with a tab at one end gluing it
所以是举起平行四边形的V形折叠

20
00:01:05,189 --> 00:01:05,199
card with a tab at one end gluing it
而我们刚刚看过的那个

21
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:08,819
card with a tab at one end gluing it
into a loop but in this case the tabs
虽然是正方形

22
00:01:08,819 --> 00:01:08,829
into a loop but in this case the tabs
这是基于平行折叠不

23
00:01:08,829 --> 00:01:10,859
into a loop but in this case the tabs
that attach it to the page run the hole
退还这一个，这是

24
00:01:10,859 --> 00:01:10,869
that attach it to the page run the hole
基于v折，但有一个折痕

25
00:01:10,869 --> 00:01:13,260
that attach it to the page run the hole
of each side and then there's a crease
v停留在页面上的位置

26
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:13,270
of each side and then there's a crease
另一端的另一个仍然只是

27
00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:15,029
of each side and then there's a crease
above each corner and then you need
带有一个标签的卡环

28
00:01:15,029 --> 00:01:15,039
above each corner and then you need
在一起，我们会在

29
00:01:15,039 --> 00:01:17,580
above each corner and then you need
another crease two creases above the
在这种情况下，我们开始呈锥形

30
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:17,590
another crease two creases above the
因此对于这些，您将需要一个指南针

31
00:01:17,590 --> 00:01:25,349
another crease two creases above the
base fold so that's that one this is a
画画基本图案

32
00:01:25,349 --> 00:01:25,359
base fold so that's that one this is a
网，所以你可以使这种类型的

33
00:01:25,359 --> 00:01:27,569
base fold so that's that one this is a
similar idea this is a square but in
像火山一样，你也可以

34
00:01:27,569 --> 00:01:27,579
similar idea this is a square but in
这种类型就像漏斗形

35
00:01:27,579 --> 00:01:30,690
similar idea this is a square but in
this case this is based on a v-fold
这很容易变成

36
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:30,700
this case this is based on a v-fold
花，所以这里有一个例子

37
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:33,319
this case this is based on a v-fold
so it's a v-fold lifting a parallelogram
花艺设计，所以我们有两层

38
00:01:33,319 --> 00:01:33,329
so it's a v-fold lifting a parallelogram
花瓣，然后我们有一个金字塔

39
00:01:33,329 --> 00:01:37,279
so it's a v-fold lifting a parallelogram
whereas this one we just looked at
金字塔设计的中间

40
00:01:37,279 --> 00:01:37,289
whereas this one we just looked at
在教程21中解释所有

41
00:01:37,289 --> 00:01:41,149
whereas this one we just looked at
although it's square
飞机实际上有六架飞机

42


被提升，所以您可以添加到

43
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:43,889
this one is based on parallel folds not
其中任何一个还有沟壑

44
00:01:43,889 --> 00:01:43,899
this one is based on parallel folds not
在胶粘到的地方创建

45
00:01:43,899 --> 00:01:49,859
this one is based on parallel folds not
refunds this one this again this is
将此页面粘在平行折页上

46
00:01:49,859 --> 00:01:49,869
refunds this one this again this is
这样有两个黏住的地方

47
00:01:49,869 --> 00:01:52,410
refunds this one this again this is
based on v folds but there's one crease
平行于脊椎，所以它们在哪里

48
00:01:52,410 --> 00:01:52,420
based on v folds but there's one crease
胶合你创造一个沟壑，你

49
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:54,870
based on v folds but there's one crease
where the v sticks to the page and
可以内置，所以这是另一个例子

50
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:54,880
where the v sticks to the page and
这是带有金字塔的基本花

51
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,789
where the v sticks to the page and
another at the other end is still just a
在中间键入机制，然后

52
00:01:56,789 --> 00:01:56,799
another at the other end is still just a
这是一个反折的零件装入

53
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:59,279
another at the other end is still just a
loop of card with one tab holding it
沟渠

54
00:01:59,279 --> 00:01:59,289
loop of card with one tab holding it
所以当你打开而不只是一个

55
00:01:59,289 --> 00:02:04,739
loop of card with one tab holding it
together then we get more interesting in
像这样的直件，我们有一个

56
00:02:04,739 --> 00:02:04,749
together then we get more interesting in
在三个维度上举起的那一块

57
00:02:04,749 --> 00:02:06,779
together then we get more interesting in
this case we start getting tapered shape
所以我们只是做一个非常基础的开顶

58
00:02:06,779 --> 00:02:06,789
this case we start getting tapered shape
形状只是一个粘在一起的环，所以

59
00:02:06,789 --> 00:02:09,480
this case we start getting tapered shape
so for these you will need a compass to
拿一张底纸用你的底纸

60
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:09,490
so for these you will need a compass to
所以就给自己剪一条卡

61
00:02:09,490 --> 00:02:11,820
so for these you will need a compass to
draw the draw the basic pattern
好久了

62
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:11,830
draw the draw the basic pattern
将文件夹胶合片一端折叠

63
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:14,700
draw the draw the basic pattern
the net so you can make this type the
好了，现在你带另一端

64
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:14,710
the net so you can make this type the
你可以把它粘在胶上

65
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:18,720
the net so you can make this type the
like a volcano shape you can also make
闭上你可能想要它下面

66
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:18,730
like a volcano shape you can also make
无论如何，胶水并不重要

67
00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:21,570
like a volcano shape you can also make
this type it's like a funnel shape and
这样我们就将其粘贴到一个循环中，

68
00:02:21,570 --> 00:02:21,580
this type it's like a funnel shape and
然后把它压扁，因为你会

69
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:23,700
this type it's like a funnel shape and
this lends itself to being turned into
需要一个你需要像这样

70
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:23,710
this lends itself to being turned into
所以会像这个文件夹一样打开

71
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:27,650
this lends itself to being turned into
flowers so here we have an example of a
将您知道的文件标签粘贴到

72
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:27,660
flowers so here we have an example of a
一路走到尽头

73
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:31,140
flowers so here we have an example of a
flower design so we've got two layers of
双方，你只是一个很大的长折痕

74
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:31,150
flower design so we've got two layers of
把它折起来，现在你

75
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:33,870
flower design so we've got two layers of
petals and then we've got a pyramid in
只想在中间留下一个标签

76
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:33,880
petals and then we've got a pyramid in
两侧，所以你可以沿着

77
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:35,880
petals and then we've got a pyramid in
the middle that the pyramid design will
折痕

78
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:35,890
the middle that the pyramid design will
然后在中间留下一个部分

79
00:02:35,890 --> 00:02:40,620
the middle that the pyramid design will
explain in tutorial 21 all that the
仅用于一点粘合

80
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:40,630
explain in tutorial 21 all that the
所以这是两个循环

81
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:42,480
explain in tutorial 21 all that the
planes there are actually six planes
标签上的标签，确保它们工作正常

82
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:42,490
planes there are actually six planes
带你的基地，看看你为什么想要

83
00:02:42,490 --> 00:02:44,850
planes there are actually six planes
that are lifted so you can add pieces to
它看着你想要什么样的摇动

84
00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:44,860
that are lifted so you can add pieces to
你只想要一个长椭圆形或做

85
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:46,800
that are lifted so you can add pieces to
any of those there's also gullies
你想要它几乎圆到看到多远

86
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:46,810
any of those there's also gullies
远离基地，你想知道我们是否去

87
00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:49,320
any of those there's also gullies
created where where it's glued to the
相当圆，这就是重点

88
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:49,330
created where where it's glued to the
标记从脊柱一侧躺下

89
00:02:49,330 --> 00:02:52,560
created where where it's glued to the
page this is glued down parallel folds
将胶水放在一个标签上，然后

90
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:52,570
page this is glued down parallel folds
将折痕粘在线上

91
00:02:52,570 --> 00:02:54,720
page this is glued down parallel folds
so that there's two sticking places
平行于中央沟

92
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:54,730
so that there's two sticking places
将其他标签向下折平放上胶水

93
00:02:54,730 --> 00:02:56,850
so that there's two sticking places
parallel to the spine and so where they
一折的底座再次关闭了

94
00:02:56,850 --> 00:02:56,860
parallel to the spine and so where they
这需要很大的压力，所以

95
00:02:56,860 --> 00:02:59,160
parallel to the spine and so where they
glue down you create a gully that you
确保您有机会

96
00:02:59,160 --> 00:02:59,170
glue down you create a gully that you
胶水脱落，在那里你会

97
00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:02,270
glue down you create a gully that you
can build into so here's another example
只要找到相当的磨损

98
00:03:02,270 --> 00:03:02,280
can build into so here's another example
墙壁很短，很好，但是

99
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:05,310
can build into so here's another example
this is a basic flower with a pyramid
你走得越高，他们往往会倾向于

100
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:05,320
this is a basic flower with a pyramid
倾斜卡的弯曲开始

101
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:07,920
this is a basic flower with a pyramid
type mechanism in the middle and then
影响形状我现在将制作一个

102
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:07,930
type mechanism in the middle and then
花型设计，使它呈锥形

103
00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:11,640
type mechanism in the middle and then
this is a counter folded piece load into
形状，因此您需要

104
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:11,650
this is a counter folded piece load into
您的指南针，所以从基础表开始

105
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:12,150
this is a counter folded piece load into
the gully
折成两折折得很好

106
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:12,160
the gully
它重新回到自身，再次折起

107
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:14,910
the gully
so as you open rather than just being a
现在拿一张卡，走吧

108
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:14,920
so as you open rather than just being a
换一个黄色的，把指南针放在上面

109
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:17,100
so as you open rather than just being a
straight piece like this one we've got a
一侧，你需要画大一点

110
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:17,110
straight piece like this one we've got a
尽可能以弧线的方式工作

111
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:25,280
straight piece like this one we've got a
piece that lifts up three dimensionally
弧形的平面越多

112


花瓣会站起来

113
00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:28,979
so we just make a really basic open top
方舟越紧，他们越会

114
00:03:28,979 --> 00:03:28,989
so we just make a really basic open top
躺下，如果你拿一个

115
00:03:28,989 --> 00:03:32,310
so we just make a really basic open top
shapes just a loop glued together so
圈成六圈

116
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:32,320
shapes just a loop glued together so
相等的部分将是

117
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:35,150
shapes just a loop glued together so
take a base sheet use your base sheets
像这样的东西我们只是做了

118
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:35,160
take a base sheet use your base sheets
实际上是完全扁平化的

119
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:38,160
take a base sheet use your base sheets
so just cut yourself a strip of card
艺术就是力量，所以现在我们

120
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:38,170
so just cut yourself a strip of card
尽我们所能

121
00:03:38,170 --> 00:03:46,330
so just cut yourself a strip of card
right long
所以用这个罗盘是最宽的

122


它会打开，所以做一个大弧线，然后

123
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:51,830
folder gluing tab onto one end fold it
决定你要花瓣多高

124
00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:51,840
folder gluing tab onto one end fold it
因此，我只是将其随机移动

125
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,650
folder gluing tab onto one end fold it
well now you bring the other end round
并绘制另一个RMS，然后

126
00:03:54,650 --> 00:03:54,660
well now you bring the other end round
标记中心点

127
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:57,140
well now you bring the other end round
and you can just glue that on glue it
指南针很重要，所以

128
00:03:57,140 --> 00:03:57,150
and you can just glue that on glue it
有，现在改变直径

129
00:03:57,150 --> 00:03:58,520
and you can just glue that on glue it
shut you might want it underneath
改变铅笔尖之间的距离

130
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:58,530
shut you might want it underneath
而你不希望的是

131
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:01,700
shut you might want it underneath
doesn't really matter anyway glue on
一样的半径

132
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:01,710
doesn't really matter anyway glue on
这弧是所以我要去做什么

133
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:13,910
doesn't really matter anyway glue on
that so we glue that into a loop and
儿子大约四四厘米，

134
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:13,920
that so we glue that into a loop and
只是从一开始就开始测量

135
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:17,060
that so we glue that into a loop and
then you crush it flat because you will
只是测量出六个部分

136
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:17,070
then you crush it flat because you will
做六件事真的很重要

137
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:19,760
then you crush it flat because you will
need a that you need it to be like this
一二三四五

138
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:19,770
need a that you need it to be like this
六行，现在您需要计分

139
00:04:19,770 --> 00:04:23,050
need a that you need it to be like this
so this will open up like this folder a
实现我正在使用biro，而您

140
00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:23,060
so this will open up like this folder a
从中心点划线

141
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:25,580
so this will open up like this folder a
gluing you know file tabs on to the
你的指南针点放在

142
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:25,590
gluing you know file tabs on to the
