again it's by Mathew Reinhardt this is

52
00:01:44,230 --> 00:01:44,240
again it's by Mathew Reinhardt this is

again it's by Mathew Reinhardt this is
the spread so in this case this is the

54
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:47,030
the spread so in this case this is the

55
00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:49,660
the spread so in this case this is the
structure that's been raised on the one

56
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:49,670
structure that's been raised on the one

57
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:52,410
structure that's been raised on the one
side of this crease here and the

58
00:01:52,410 --> 00:01:52,420
side of this crease here and the

59
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:54,760
side of this crease here and the
asymmetric V pod is actually hidden

60
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:54,770
asymmetric V pod is actually hidden

61
00:01:54,770 --> 00:01:58,660
asymmetric V pod is actually hidden
underneath this floating plane so here

62
00:01:58,660 --> 00:01:58,670
underneath this floating plane so here

63
00:01:58,670 --> 00:02:00,370
underneath this floating plane so here
you can see this is the floating plane

64
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:00,380
you can see this is the floating plane

65
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:04,780
you can see this is the floating plane
this is the asymmetric V fold which has

66
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:04,790
this is the asymmetric V fold which has

67
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:07,929
this is the asymmetric V fold which has
been used to raise this structure if you

68
00:02:07,929 --> 00:02:07,939
been used to raise this structure if you

69
00:02:07,939 --> 00:02:10,240
been used to raise this structure if you
look at this structure end on you can

70
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:10,250
look at this structure end on you can

71
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:12,699
look at this structure end on you can
see it's all parallelograms all being

72
00:02:12,699 --> 00:02:12,709
see it's all parallelograms all being

73
00:02:12,709 --> 00:02:13,370
see it's all parallelograms all being
raised by

74
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:13,380
raised by

75
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:15,020
raised by
one plane which is lifted by the

76
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:15,030
one plane which is lifted by the

77
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:17,750
one plane which is lifted by the
asymmetric v-fold so now I'll just run

78
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:17,760
asymmetric v-fold so now I'll just run

79
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,520
asymmetric v-fold so now I'll just run
through some angles for the isometric

80
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:19,530
through some angles for the isometric

the angle between the spine and where it

88
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:32,040
the angle between the spine and where it

89
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:34,550
the angle between the spine and where it
sticks down that's 30 and the angle

90
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:34,560
sticks down that's 30 and the angle

91
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,440
sticks down that's 30 and the angle
between the spine or it sticks down here

92
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:36,450
between the spine or it sticks down here

93
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:38,990
between the spine or it sticks down here
that's 90 when the whole thing is flat

94
00:02:38,990 --> 00:02:39,000
that's 90 when the whole thing is flat

95
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,270
that's 90 when the whole thing is flat
the whole single life left and as you

96
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:41,280
the whole single life left and as you

97
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,430
the whole single life left and as you
can see as it closes like this the whole

98
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:43,440
can see as it closes like this the whole

99
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,050
can see as it closes like this the whole
thing moves forward so you can build

100
00:02:45,050 --> 00:02:45,060
thing moves forward so you can build

101
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:49,070
thing moves forward so you can build
parallelograms onto this flap here in

102
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:49,080
parallelograms onto this flap here in

103
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:52,340
parallelograms onto this flap here in
this version the angle and the base is

104
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:52,350
this version the angle and the base is

105
00:02:52,350 --> 00:02:54,770
this version the angle and the base is
still 30 but the small angle and the

106
00:02:54,770 --> 00:02:54,780
still 30 but the small angle and the

107
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:58,160
still 30 but the small angle and the
asymmetric v-fold is 35 and the angle on

108
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:58,170
asymmetric v-fold is 35 and the angle on

109
00:02:58,170 --> 00:03:00,500
asymmetric v-fold is 35 and the angle on
the base is 90 and the angle on the

110
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:00,510
the base is 90 and the angle on the

111
00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:03,890
the base is 90 and the angle on the
asymmetric v-fold is 95 so I've made one

112
00:03:03,890 --> 00:03:03,900
asymmetric v-fold is 95 so I've made one

113
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:07,250
asymmetric v-fold is 95 so I've made one
of those here here's the piece you've

114
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:07,260
of those here here's the piece you've

115
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:09,380
of those here here's the piece you've
got the big angle on the asymmetric

116
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:09,390
got the big angle on the asymmetric

117
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:12,170
got the big angle on the asymmetric
piece is 95 and the small angle on it is

118
00:03:12,170 --> 00:03:12,180
piece is 95 and the small angle on it is

119
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:16,150
piece is 95 and the small angle on it is
40 degrees on the base you've got 90 and

120
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:16,160
40 degrees on the base you've got 90 and

121
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:18,800
40 degrees on the base you've got 90 and
35 so I'll just stick that band so you

122
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:18,810
35 so I'll just stick that band so you

123
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:23,650
35 so I'll just stick that band so you
can see how it goes with all these

124
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:23,660
can see how it goes with all these

125
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:26,510
can see how it goes with all these
asymmetric so you have a the small angle

126
00:03:26,510 --> 00:03:26,520
asymmetric so you have a the small angle

127
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:28,970
asymmetric so you have a the small angle
on the pop-up goes over the big angle on

128
00:03:28,970 --> 00:03:28,980
on the pop-up goes over the big angle on

129
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:31,040
on the pop-up goes over the big angle on
the page the big angle on the pop-up

130
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:31,050
the page the big angle on the pop-up

131
00:03:31,050 --> 00:03:33,110
the page the big angle on the pop-up
goes over the small angle on the page so

132
00:03:33,110 --> 00:03:33,120
goes over the small angle on the page so

133
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,950
goes over the small angle on the page so
it's going to stick though like that

134
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:35,960
it's going to stick though like that

135
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:39,110
it's going to stick though like that
I'll just glue this and stick it on as

136
00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:39,120
I'll just glue this and stick it on as

137
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,540
I'll just glue this and stick it on as
I've measured the positions on the base

138
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:41,550
I've measured the positions on the base

139
00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:45,170
I've measured the positions on the base
and on the pop-up I can just do it all

140
00:03:45,170 --> 00:03:45,180
and on the pop-up I can just do it all

141
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:46,880
and on the pop-up I can just do it all
rather than sticking down one side and

142
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:46,890
rather than sticking down one side and

143
00:03:46,890 --> 00:03:54,680
rather than sticking down one side and
letting it find its natural position

144
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:54,690


145
00:03:54,690 --> 00:04:00,930
stick that down there and that down

146
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:00,940
stick that down there and that down

147
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:06,630
stick that down there and that down
there there it is close it down I've

148
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:06,640
there there it is close it down I've

149
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,670
there there it is close it down I've
left this flap on the top just so you

150
00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:08,680
left this flap on the top just so you

151
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:12,259
left this flap on the top just so you
can build parallelograms onto it and

152
00:04:12,259 --> 00:04:12,269
can build parallelograms onto it and

153
00:04:12,269 --> 00:04:15,150
can build parallelograms onto it and
that's it really the useful tip for

154
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:15,160
that's it really the useful tip for

155
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:18,600
that's it really the useful tip for
building things on one side of the base
