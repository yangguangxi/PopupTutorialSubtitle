00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:05,760
converging creases so all the all four
每一面都有这些小柜台

143
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,720
converging creases so all the all four
creases the spine folds the spoke fold
用来作为肌肉的褶皱

144
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:08,730
creases the spine folds the spoke fold
抬起这两个小机器人，这样

145
00:04:08,730 --> 00:04:10,220
creases the spine folds the spoke fold
in the middle and the two on each side
该页面打开和关闭，您可以看到

146
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:10,230
in the middle and the two on each side
肌肉的反折

147
00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:15,680
in the middle and the two on each side
all converge at the same point the other
移动这两个两个小型机器人，但是

148
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:15,690
all converge at the same point the other
这些基本的弹出式窗口

149
00:04:15,690 --> 00:04:18,470
all converge at the same point the other
type of pop-up is parallel creases so we
页面平坦时弹出窗口

150
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:18,480
type of pop-up is parallel creases so we
是平坦的，实际上不是真的

151
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:21,380
type of pop-up is parallel creases so we
take another card fold it in half fold
弹出窗口，它们更像是你的东西

152
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:21,390
take another card fold it in half fold
可以添加到弹出窗口，所以我将展示

153
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:23,590
take another card fold it in half fold
it thoroughly as usual
您如何制作两个弹出窗口

154
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:23,600
it thoroughly as usual
收敛折痕平行折痕

155
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:26,170
it thoroughly as usual
if time make two cuts again this is the
有三个校长三个

156
00:04:26,170 --> 00:04:26,180
if time make two cuts again this is the
适用于所有人的重要原则

157
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:28,000
if time make two cuts again this is the
folded edge I'm cutting in from the
弹出第一个是，每个

158
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:28,010
folded edge I'm cutting in from the
弹出窗口必须跨越厨房，所以这是一个

159
00:04:28,010 --> 00:04:30,670
folded edge I'm cutting in from the
folded edge you don't even actually need
我们将它折成两半

160
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:30,680
folded edge you don't even actually need
眼睛真的折皱了

161
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:32,800
folded edge you don't even actually need
to use scissors you can actually tear it
回到自身折痕这是

162
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:32,810
to use scissors you can actually tear it
你的底片是厨房

163
00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:35,590
to use scissors you can actually tear it
the lines don't have to be straight they
是厨房的开口，将提供动力

164
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:35,600
the lines don't have to be straight they
弹出窗口，我将制作一块

165
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,650
the lines don't have to be straight they
can be they can be Wiggly jagged at an
弹出窗口

166
00:04:38,650 --> 00:04:38,660
can be they can be Wiggly jagged at an
所以再做一次，一切都是

167
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:41,770
can be they can be Wiggly jagged at an
angle whatever you like again fold it
用眼睛做，你只需要切

168
00:04:41,770 --> 00:04:41,780
angle whatever you like again fold it
将卡片对折成半折

169
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:45,910
angle whatever you like again fold it
back so you get this shape fold it back
真的很彻底，第二

170
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:45,920
back so you get this shape fold it back
原则是弹出窗口必须

171
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:50,170
back so you get this shape fold it back
on itself to enhance the creases open it
厨房两侧的平衡

172
00:04:50,170 --> 00:04:50,180
on itself to enhance the creases open it
所以弹出式数学Panigale他们必须

173
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:53,140
on itself to enhance the creases open it
up push it through so you get a kind of
粘在厨房的两侧

174
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:53,150
up push it through so you get a kind of
然后他们必须在每一侧保持平衡

175
00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:56,880
up push it through so you get a kind of
step these two these two pieces
的沟壑，所以在这种情况下，我们

176
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:56,890
step these two these two pieces
产生V折的收敛折痕

177
00:04:56,890 --> 00:04:59,710
step these two these two pieces
demonstrate the basic underlying
带有v形折叠的角度

178
00:04:59,710 --> 00:04:59,720
demonstrate the basic underlying
平衡，这是我们的弹出窗口

179
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:02,470
demonstrate the basic underlying
principles of all pop ups all pop ups
将标签折叠到底部

180
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:02,480
principles of all pop ups all pop ups
这样做会粘到页面上

181
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:05,530
principles of all pop ups all pop ups
either all the creases meet at the same
我们将两个角度

182
00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:05,540
either all the creases meet at the same
弹出窗口的每一侧都在同一位置

183
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:08,280
either all the creases meet at the same
points they're converging creases
他们都是九十度

184
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:08,290
points they're converging creases
再次加强那些褶皱

185
00:05:08,290 --> 00:05:10,660
points they're converging creases
meeting at the same point on the spine
我们到了弹出窗口的角度

186
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:10,670
meeting at the same point on the spine
现在要保持平衡

187
00:05:10,670 --> 00:05:13,570
meeting at the same point on the spine
the other type of parallel creases so
页面和底座上的两个角度

188
00:05:13,570 --> 00:05:13,580
the other type of parallel creases so
我们必须保持平衡，以便获得胶水

189
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:15,970
the other type of parallel creases so
all the creases are parallel to the
我用胶水的秘密是把胶水

190
00:05:15,970 --> 00:05:15,980
all the creases are parallel to the
在一侧，然后我总是

191
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:17,890
all the creases are parallel to the
spine and these are the two underlying
用我的小手指我用我的小手指

192
00:05:17,890 --> 00:05:17,900
spine and these are the two underlying
手指，以便我可以涂胶

193
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:21,820
spine and these are the two underlying
principles in all pop ups so this type
真的很均匀但是我的手指仍然

194
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:21,830
principles in all pop ups so this type
dextra，这样我就可以处理其他事情了

195
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:23,770
principles in all pop ups so this type
of proper mechanism is called counter
没有他们被卡住，这是真的

196
00:05:23,770 --> 00:05:23,780
of proper mechanism is called counter
重要的是胶水一直上升到

197
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:26,590
of proper mechanism is called counter
folds and here's an example that I did
折痕弹出折痕是

198
00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:26,600
folds and here's an example that I did
胶水真的很重要

199
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:29,110
folds and here's an example that I did
with some school kids and so this is
增加所有测量到

200
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:29,120
with some school kids and so this is
折痕，所以这里我们去中央折痕

201
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:32,920
with some school kids and so this is
counter folds it's it's this type with
与沟壑和棍子对齐

202
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:32,930
counter folds it's it's this type with
那面朝下，现在你把整个

203
00:05:32,930 --> 00:05:36,070
counter folds it's it's this type with
converging creases and it's made made
件关闭，在另一侧放胶

204
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:36,080
converging creases and it's made made
再次涂抹胶水直到折痕

205
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:38,560
converging creases and it's made made
into a face and it's just glued on to a
关好底座，然后按一下

206
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:38,570
into a face and it's just glued on to a
第一个弹出窗口，因此在这种情况下，每个

207
00:05:38,570 --> 00:05:41,500
into a face and it's just glued on to a
background so this is really basic
弹出跨越一个沟壑，然后

208
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:41,510
background so this is really basic
第二个原则是每个弹出窗口

209
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:44,710
background so this is really basic
simple stuff there is a book with some
沟渠两侧的失衡

210
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:44,720
simple stuff there is a book with some
有折痕的V形折叠

211
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:49,140
simple stuff there is a book with some
in it this is this is dinner time by
在同一点收敛

212
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:49,150
in it this is this is dinner time by
是平衡的角度，所以角度

213
00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:52,780
in it this is this is dinner time by
champion Kowski look at the first spread
在这两个底座上都是一样大小

214
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:52,790
champion Kowski look at the first spread
弹出的角度都是

215
00:05:52,790 --> 00:05:57,220
champion Kowski look at the first spread
and it's one of these v-folds converging
相同的大小，所以如果我们称这个为a和this

216
00:05:57,220 --> 00:05:57,230
and it's one of these v-folds converging
B我们一侧有加号B

217
00:05:57,230 --> 00:06:01,960
and it's one of these v-folds converging
crease converging creases pop-ups we can
另一边有加号B，所以

218
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:01,970
crease converging creases pop-ups we can
角度平衡，这是基本的V形折叠

219
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:03,670
crease converging creases pop-ups we can
also look at the last spread in this
[音乐]

220
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:03,680
also look at the last spread in this
这些有五种配置

221
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:08,020
also look at the last spread in this
book and here it is this bottom jaw of
文件夹，所以我将向您展示

222
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:08,030
book and here it is this bottom jaw of
其他五个，所以这是类型

223
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:10,240
book and here it is this bottom jaw of
this shark is converging creases this is
我们只是使这是正确的角度

224
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:10,250
this shark is converging creases this is
v折叠弹出窗口上的角度为

225
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:12,340
this shark is converging creases this is
the V fold and the top drawer of the
两者都是90度这是锐角

226
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:12,350
the V fold and the top drawer of the
v折叠它们所在的弹出窗口上的角度

227
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:15,700
the V fold and the top drawer of the
shark is a parallel fold you can always
仍然是相同的，但角度是

228
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:15,710
shark is a parallel fold you can always
两者都小于90度

229
00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:17,590
shark is a parallel fold you can always
tell parallel folds if you look at the
尖的v形褶皱，这是一个变化

230
00:06:17,590 --> 00:06:17,600
tell parallel folds if you look at the
在这个锐角上，但在这种情况下

231
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:20,770
tell parallel folds if you look at the
book end on you can look down the spine
更极端的是，这是

232
00:06:20,770 --> 00:06:20,780
book end on you can look down the spine
钝角默认为

233
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:23,050
book end on you can look down the spine
and you can see that although all the
弹出式窗口上都超过90

234
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:23,060
and you can see that although all the
他们每个人的度数仍然相同

235
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:27,550
and you can see that although all the
creases are parallel this type of
侧面和底座上的角度

236
00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:27,560
creases are parallel this type of
双方仍然一样

237
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:30,610
creases are parallel this type of
mechanism can be applied to any folds in
你有平衡，然后这就是

238
00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:30,620
mechanism can be applied to any folds in
最后最吸引人的

239
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:33,220
mechanism can be applied to any folds in
any pop-up and so you can use this type
v形折叠真的是不对称的

240
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:33,230
any pop-up and so you can use this type
V形折叠，因此

241
00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:35,950
any pop-up and so you can use this type
of mechanism as actual part of the
弹出窗口是不同的，并且角度

242
00:06:35,950 --> 00:06:35,960
of mechanism as actual part of the
基础不同，你有四个

243
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:37,240
of mechanism as actual part of the
sculpting of the
不同的角度，但在

244
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:37,250
sculpting of the
在一侧的基础上加上在

245
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:39,610
sculpting of the
the sculpture or it can be used as just
弹出窗口等于

246
00:06:39,610 --> 00:06:39,620
the sculpture or it can be used as just
另一边加上角度

247
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:41,890
the sculpture or it can be used as just
the muscle to raise a larger piece of
弹出窗口，因此您仍然可以保持平衡

248
00:06:41,890 --> 00:06:41,900
the muscle to raise a larger piece of
虽然所有四个角度都不一样

249
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:44,890
the muscle to raise a larger piece of
card so if we look at this book and this
[音乐]

250
00:06:44,890 --> 00:06:44,900
card so if we look at this book and this
现在我将弹出一个

251
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:48,400
card so if we look at this book and this
is jungle days by Helen bomber and this
平行折叠采取另一种基础，

252
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:48,410
is jungle days by Helen bomber and this
这是一个弹出的片段，所以这是

253
00:06:48,410 --> 00:06:52,150
is jungle days by Helen bomber and this
is an example of a counter fold being
平行折叠

254
00:06:52,150 --> 00:06:52,160
is an example of a counter fold being
所以在这种情况下，我们在

255
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:55,150
is an example of a counter fold being
used to scalp the actual pop-up so this
当你做的时候你的外边缘

256
00:06:55,150 --> 00:06:55,160
used to scalp the actual pop-up so this
制作粘贴标签，他们永远都不会

257
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:59,230
used to scalp the actual pop-up so this
here this is the counter fold as the
小于半英寸或一厘米

258
00:06:59,230 --> 00:06:59,240
here this is the counter fold as the
因为弹出窗口往往会产生

259
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:02,620
here this is the counter fold as the
book closes as it opens you can see how
标签上的压力很大，所以您

260
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:02,630
book closes as it opens you can see how
需要他们相当广泛才能接受

261
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:04,180
book closes as it opens you can see how
it moves and yet this is all made from
打开和关闭的压力，所以这是

262
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:04,190
it moves and yet this is all made from
将成为平行折叠，而你

263
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:06,100
it moves and yet this is all made from
one flat piece of card you can actually
真的可以和你一起玩

264
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:06,110
one flat piece of card you can actually
可以使它在页面上真正宽，或者

265
00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:08,680
one flat piece of card you can actually
close the book and just open and close
你可以把它弄得很近我倾向于

266
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:08,690
close the book and just open and close
实际切断了胶合的角落

267
00:07:08,690 --> 00:07:10,840
close the book and just open and close
it like that so this is the counter fold
标签，我只是想当他们在

268
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:10,850
it like that so this is the counter fold
尖锐程度会降低

269
00:07:10,850 --> 00:07:13,450
it like that so this is the counter fold
being used as part of the sculpture of
不管是否

270
00:07:13,450 --> 00:07:13,460
being used as part of the sculpture of
他们在里面是这样还是

271
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:20,800
being used as part of the sculpture of
the design this book this is robot by
他们在外面这样你可以吗

272
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:20,810
the design this book this is robot by
知道标签的位置

273
00:07:20,810 --> 00:07:24,960
the design this book this is robot by
champion Kowski in this pop-up spread
无关紧要的唯一事情

274
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:24,970
champion Kowski in this pop-up spread
重要的是折痕的位置，所以

275
00:07:24,970 --> 00:07:28,300
champion Kowski in this pop-up spread
these counter folds he's used these type
这是把它对折

276
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:28,310
these counter folds he's used these type
然后折叠选项卡

277
00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:31,090
these counter folds he's used these type
of converging crease counter folds these
平衡弹出框的长度

278
00:07:31,090 --> 00:07:31,100
of converging crease counter folds these
双方都是一样的，所以我们再次

279
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:33,930
of converging crease counter folds these
are the muscles to move larger pieces so
将胶水放在一侧上

pop-ups when the page is flat the pop-up
在底座上有一点点

299
00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:03,460
pop-ups when the page is flat the pop-up
is flat and they're not actually true
在弹出窗口中，这是第二个

300
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:03,470
is flat and they're not actually true
平行折叠的类型是

301
00:08:03,470 --> 00:08:05,200
is flat and they're not actually true
pop-ups they're more like something you
平行四边形，你这样看

302
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:05,210
pop-ups they're more like something you
您可以在左侧的一侧看到

303
00:08:05,210 --> 00:08:07,659
pop-ups they're more like something you
can add to pop-ups so I'm going to show
弹出窗口的长度很短

304
00:08:07,659 --> 00:08:07,669
can add to pop-ups so I'm going to show
他们在基础上很长

305
00:08:07,669 --> 00:08:10,180
can add to pop-ups so I'm going to show
you how to make two pop-ups one
右边的长度很短

00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:10,190
you how to make two pop-ups one
弹出窗口的底部和较长的长度

307
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:15,900
you how to make two pop-ups one
converging creases one parallel creases
再次，您已经平衡了长度

308


平衡，最后一个是

309
00:08:15,910 --> 00:08:18,280
there are three principals three
这是不对称的平行折叠

310
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:18,290
there are three principals three
四个长度都不同，所以

311
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:20,020
there are three principals three
important principles that apply to all
离开时，您在

312
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:20,030
important principles that apply to all
基地和短的弹出窗口

313
00:08:20,030 --> 00:08:22,240
important principles that apply to all
pop-ups the first one is that every
右边的那一点

314
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:22,250
pop-ups the first one is that every
在弹出窗口上停留很长时间

315
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:25,120
pop-ups the first one is that every
pop-up must span a galley so this is a
所以当整个事情结束时，您可以看到

316
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:25,130
pop-up must span a galley so this is a
从脊椎褶皱到领先

317
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:28,570
pop-up must span a galley so this is a
base sheet we fold it in half do it by
领先的褶皱双方是相同的

318
00:08:28,570 --> 00:08:28,580
base sheet we fold it in half do it by
弹出式窗口在V形折叠上处于平衡状态

319
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:32,649
base sheet we fold it in half do it by
eye crease it really thoroughly fold it
平行折叠处平衡的角度

320
00:08:32,649 --> 00:08:32,659
eye crease it really thoroughly fold it
这是平衡的长度，

321
00:08:32,659 --> 00:08:37,480
eye crease it really thoroughly fold it
back on itself crease it again this is
第三

322
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:37,490
back on itself crease it again this is
第三个原则是每个弹出窗口

323
00:08:37,490 --> 00:08:41,709
back on itself crease it again this is
your base sheet this is the galley
创造沟壑，所以第一个原则

324
00:08:41,709 --> 00:08:41,719
your base sheet this is the galley
每次弹出我的扳手时，

325
00:08:41,719 --> 00:08:43,690
your base sheet this is the galley
it's the galley opening that will power
第一沟是脊柱褶皱

326
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:43,700
it's the galley opening that will power
原则上每个弹出窗口必须保持平衡

327
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:47,260
it's the galley opening that will power
the pop-up I'll take a piece to make the
每个部位V形折弯

328
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:47,270
the pop-up I'll take a piece to make the
平衡的平行褶皱就是长度

329
00:08:47,270 --> 00:08:53,319
the pop-up I'll take a piece to make the
pop-ups with
平衡，然后是第三原则

330


是每个弹出窗口都会创建沟渠，

331
00:08:53,329 --> 00:08:55,819
so do it again everything everything is
您可以将弹出窗口粘贴到这些沟渠中

332
00:08:55,819 --> 00:08:55,829
so do it again everything everything is
所以这是一条平行折叠的沟

333
00:08:55,829 --> 00:08:57,980
so do it again everything everything is
done by eye you just cut the piece of
可以像这样坚持下去

334
00:08:57,980 --> 00:08:57,990
done by eye you just cut the piece of
可以像这样坚持这个

335
00:08:57,990 --> 00:09:07,189
done by eye you just cut the piece of
card in half fold it in half crease it
然后再在V形折叠上

336
00:09:07,189 --> 00:09:07,199
card in half fold it in half crease it
你有这些可以粘的沟壑

337
00:09:07,199 --> 00:09:10,249
card in half fold it in half crease it
really thoroughly and the second
页面关闭时将其放入背面

338
00:09:10,249 --> 00:09:10,259
really thoroughly and the second
该弹出窗口将关闭，或者您也

339
00:09:10,259 --> 00:09:13,730
really thoroughly and the second
principle is that pop-ups must must
有一个沟壑，你可以贴在那里

340
00:09:13,730 --> 00:09:13,740
principle is that pop-ups must must
可以将弹出窗口粘贴到您的沟渠中

341
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:15,620
principle is that pop-ups must must
balance on each side of the galleys
可以将它贴在您喜欢的任何高度

342
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:15,630
balance on each side of the galleys
我有一个例子的方式是这样的

343
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:18,199
balance on each side of the galleys
so pop-ups maths Panigale they must
是一个V形折叠，蓝色是

344
00:09:18,199 --> 00:09:18,209
so pop-ups maths Panigale they must
V形折叠

345
00:09:18,209 --> 00:09:19,730
so pop-ups maths Panigale they must
stick down to both sides of the galley
并弹出堆栈这是一个

346
00:09:19,730 --> 00:09:19,740
stick down to both sides of the galley
平行的折痕卡在这条沟里

347
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:21,590
stick down to both sides of the galley
and then they must balance on each side
这是收敛的折痕或卡在

348
00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:21,600
and then they must balance on each side
这些都是不同的形式

349
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:24,259
and then they must balance on each side
of the gully so in this case we're
的弹出窗口卡在不同的窗口中

350
00:09:24,259 --> 00:09:24,269
of the gully so in this case we're
沟渠在这里，你有一个例子

351
00:09:24,269 --> 00:09:27,769
of the gully so in this case we're
making a converging crease of V folds so
像这样的柜台折

352
00:09:27,769 --> 00:09:27,779
making a converging crease of V folds so
这是一个很大的反折

353
00:09:27,779 --> 00:09:30,050
making a converging crease of V folds so
with v-folds it's the angles that
同样的原则适用于这件作品

354
00:09:30,050 --> 00:09:30,060
with v-folds it's the angles that
弹出窗口，您可以使用三种方式

355
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:33,379
with v-folds it's the angles that
balance so here's the pop-up piece we're
基地基地可以是一个

356
00:09:33,379 --> 00:09:33,389
balance so here's the pop-up piece we're
从中弹出的基础可以

357
00:09:33,389 --> 00:09:36,379
balance so here's the pop-up piece we're
folding the tabs onto the bottom which
是弹出窗口出现的背景

358
00:09:36,379 --> 00:09:36,389
folding the tabs onto the bottom which
从它前进，也可以是一个基地和一个

359
00:09:36,389 --> 00:09:44,329
folding the tabs onto the bottom which
will glue to the page by doing it this
背景并且弹出窗口卡住了

360
00:09:44,329 --> 00:09:44,339
will glue to the page by doing it this
进软糖，所以我想要的第一个

361
00:09:44,339 --> 00:09:46,699
will glue to the page by doing it this
way we've made the two the two angles on
告诉你，这就是克里斯托弗

362
00:09:46,699 --> 00:09:46,709
way we've made the two the two angles on
哥伦布再见subasta，这是一个弹出窗口

363
00:09:46,709 --> 00:09:48,559
way we've made the two the two angles on
each side of the pop-up at the same in
50年代

364
00:09:48,559 --> 00:09:48,569
each side of the pop-up at the same in
这是使用这是使用基地作为

365
00:09:48,569 --> 00:09:53,379
each side of the pop-up at the same in
this case they're both ninety degrees
以a为基础，弹出窗口从

它

367
00:09:53,389 --> 00:09:58,449
again reinforce those those folds so
有，这是如果你实际上

368
00:09:58,449 --> 00:09:58,459
again reinforce those those folds so
从顶部看它，你会发现它是

369
00:09:58,459 --> 00:10:01,939
again reinforce those those folds so
we've got there the angles on the pop-up
基于v-fold，尽管它在哪里

370
00:10:01,939 --> 00:10:01,949
we've got there the angles on the pop-up
将所有折痕粘贴到页面上

371
00:10:01,949 --> 00:10:05,030
we've got there the angles on the pop-up
a balancing now we've got to stick it to
在同一点收敛，所以这是

372
00:10:05,030 --> 00:10:05,040
a balancing now we've got to stick it to
这是一个使用base作为

373
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:08,780
a balancing now we've got to stick it to
the page and the two angles on the base
从中弹出的基础

374
00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:08,790
the page and the two angles on the base
第二种方法可以使用

375
00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:12,999
the page and the two angles on the base
we've got to balance so we get the glue
基地是以基地为背景的

376
00:10:12,999 --> 00:10:13,009
we've got to balance so we get the glue
弹出窗口随之而来

377
00:10:13,009 --> 00:10:18,230
we've got to balance so we get the glue
my secret with glue is to put the glue
这是哭鲨的小鱼

378
00:10:18,230 --> 00:10:18,240
my secret with glue is to put the glue
因此，如果我们打开这个，这就是

379
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:21,379
my secret with glue is to put the glue
on on just on one side and then I always
基础作为背景，所以您已经

00:10:21,379 --> 00:10:21,389
on on just on one side and then I always
从它弹出的弹出窗口

381
00:10:21,389 --> 00:10:24,079
on on just on one side and then I always
use my little finger I use my little
而且在这种情况下，两个都减半

382

use my little finger I use my little
基于V折的设计

383
00:10:24,089 --> 00:10:26,540
use my little finger I use my little
finger so that I can spread the glue
他们在我看来像是对称的

384
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:26,550
finger so that I can spread the glue
v形折叠，所以两个角度都弹出

385
00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:29,769
finger so that I can spread the glue
really evenly but my fingers remain
弹出窗口的每一侧都不同，因此

386
00:10:29,769 --> 00:10:29,779
really evenly but my fingers remain
这是使用弹出窗口作为

387
00:10:29,779 --> 00:10:32,809
really evenly but my fingers remain

那是我想做的最后一件事

391
00:10:34,949 --> 00:10:36,530
without them getting stuck it's really
important that the glue goes right up to
谈论真正的技术，然后

important that the glue goes right up to
我想说的最后一件事是

393
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:38,600
important that the glue goes right up to

整个平行四边形系列

400
00:10:46,129 --> 00:10:46,139
crease so here we go the central crease
是这个设计的组合

converge at the same point
V型折叠又是一个可爱的角度V型折叠

422
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:20,010
converge at the same point
它提高了平行四边形，所以你看起来

423
00:11:20,010 --> 00:11:23,090
converge at the same point
it's the angles at balance so the angles
这样就可以看到

424
00:11:23,090 --> 00:11:23,100
it's the angles at balance so the angles
它是V形折叠产生的平行四边形

425
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:25,040
it's the angles at balance so the angles
on the base here are both the same size
还有另外一个是这个

你有这个，这是非常不寻常的

429
00:11:27,510 --> 00:11:31,160
the angles on the pop up are both the
same size so if we call this a and this
建设这是v折的

盒是V型折叠，实际上是一个

431
00:11:31,170 --> 00:11:34,250

B we've got a plus B on one side we've
是盒子后面的平行四边形

432
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:34,260
B we've got a plus B on one side we've
但这是盒子的前半部分

433
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:36,230
B we've got a plus B on one side we've
got a plus B on the other side so the
V形褶皱提高了整体

434
00:11:36,230 --> 00:11:36,240

你这样看的结构

435
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:41,260
got a plus B on the other side so the
angles balanced this is the basic v-fold
你可以看到梯子和

436
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:41,270
angles balanced this is the basic v-fold
其他一切都是平行折叠

437
00:11:41,270 --> 00:11:42,820
angles balanced this is the basic v-fold
