00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:27,920
you see how you can play with it these
are just examples where any of these
不同的长度，所以我们将有

142
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:27,930
are just examples where any of these
一侧倾斜的台阶将其折回

143
00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:30,260
are just examples where any of these
techniques can be applied to other pop
本身，然后在这一方面，我们将

144
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:30,270
techniques can be applied to other pop
只是有一个常规步骤，所以我们做了两个

145
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:32,870
techniques can be applied to other pop
up shapes other mechanisms any mountain
削减相同的长度

146
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:32,880

fold or Valley fold you can cut these
将像这样工作，我们已经

148
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:35,160
fold or Valley fold you can cut these
也得到了这个山折

149
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:38,180
fold or Valley fold you can cut these
into them and then these any of these
中间，所以我们做了一些削减

150
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:38,190
into them and then these any of these
一顶帽子可能就好了

151
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:40,279
into them and then these any of these
planes they can be used you can stick
把它折下来这么少

152
00:04:40,279 --> 00:04:40,289
planes they can be used you can stick
让我们在顶部再添加一个

153
00:04:40,289 --> 00:04:42,969
planes they can be used you can stick
pieces onto them to make pieces stand up
或只是在其中折叠一点

154
00:04:42,969 --> 00:04:42,979
pieces onto them to make pieces stand up
产生更多的飞机，我们

155
00:04:42,979 --> 00:04:47,150
pieces onto them to make pieces stand up
stick out do what do what you want so
可能很消耗，所以这里可以开始了

156
00:04:47,150 --> 00:04:47,160
stick out do what do what you want so
现在有了所有这些默认机制

157

being cut into this there's a cut there
and that piece is being pushed forward
成为折痕，这将是一个

216
00:06:15,290 --> 00:06:15,300
and that piece is being pushed forward
折痕，然后我们可以升高

217

and that piece is being pushed forward
it looks as though there's actually a
根据我们的喜好，我们将再添加一个折痕

there raising this image there's another
one there raising this image so that's
距离，我们将其称为a，因此这两个

226
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:28,710
one there raising this image so that's
是在这里和在这里的切割线

227
00:06:28,710 --> 00:06:30,140
one there raising this image so that's
quite a nicely science done
