1
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:36,930
this tutorial is about curved shapes

2
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:36,940
this tutorial is about curved shapes

3
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:40,709
this tutorial is about curved shapes
that is the taking the crease around the

4
00:00:40,709 --> 00:00:40,719
that is the taking the crease around the

5
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:43,079
that is the taking the crease around the
bend so this is at its most simple it

6
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:43,089
bend so this is at its most simple it

7
00:00:43,089 --> 00:00:46,919
bend so this is at its most simple it
gives you a beak or a nose this is a

8
00:00:46,919 --> 00:00:46,929
gives you a beak or a nose this is a

9
00:00:46,929 --> 00:00:51,209
gives you a beak or a nose this is a
more more extreme example so in this

10
00:00:51,209 --> 00:00:51,219
more more extreme example so in this

11
00:00:51,219 --> 00:00:53,700
more more extreme example so in this
case you're taking the the crease all

12
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:53,710
case you're taking the the crease all

13
00:00:53,710 --> 00:00:57,329
case you're taking the the crease all
the way around a complete curve and here

14
00:00:57,329 --> 00:00:57,339
the way around a complete curve and here

15
00:00:57,339 --> 00:01:01,049
the way around a complete curve and here
isn't another example again it's taking

16
00:01:01,049 --> 00:01:01,059
isn't another example again it's taking

17
00:01:01,059 --> 00:01:02,789
isn't another example again it's taking
it all the way around the curve

18
00:01:02,789 --> 00:01:02,799
it all the way around the curve

19
00:01:02,799 --> 00:01:06,209
it all the way around the curve
the difference between these two this

20
00:01:06,209 --> 00:01:06,219
the difference between these two this

21
00:01:06,219 --> 00:01:08,819
the difference between these two this
one is based on parallel folds this one

22
00:01:08,819 --> 00:01:08,829
one is based on parallel folds this one

23
00:01:08,829 --> 00:01:11,340
one is based on parallel folds this one
is based on refold the difference

24
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:11,350
is based on refold the difference

25
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:12,959
is based on refold the difference
between these two is explained in

26
00:01:12,959 --> 00:01:12,969
between these two is explained in

27
00:01:12,969 --> 00:01:16,260
between these two is explained in
tutorial 1 the introduction so I'll just

28
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:16,270
tutorial 1 the introduction so I'll just

29
00:01:16,270 --> 00:01:18,120
tutorial 1 the introduction so I'll just
show you a couple of examples

30
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:18,130
show you a couple of examples

31
00:01:18,130 --> 00:01:23,090
show you a couple of examples
obviously in action this is a very

32
00:01:23,090 --> 00:01:23,100
obviously in action this is a very

33
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:27,060
obviously in action this is a very
simple simple one it's just again it's

34
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:27,070
simple simple one it's just again it's

35
00:01:27,070 --> 00:01:29,639
simple simple one it's just again it's
just going around one curve and the

36
00:01:29,639 --> 00:01:29,649
just going around one curve and the

37
00:01:29,649 --> 00:01:31,410
just going around one curve and the
other this is a point of view fold

38
00:01:31,410 --> 00:01:31,420
other this is a point of view fold

39
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:36,209
other this is a point of view fold
that's in tutorial 3 this example this

40
00:01:36,209 --> 00:01:36,219
that's in tutorial 3 this example this

41
00:01:36,219 --> 00:01:39,419
that's in tutorial 3 this example this
is the parallel fold curved shape giving

42
00:01:39,419 --> 00:01:39,429
is the parallel fold curved shape giving

43
00:01:39,429 --> 00:01:41,039
is the parallel fold curved shape giving
you the fish it comes all the way around

44
00:01:41,039 --> 00:01:41,049
you the fish it comes all the way around

45
00:01:41,049 --> 00:01:45,389
you the fish it comes all the way around
you can see here we've got a small piece

46
00:01:45,389 --> 00:01:45,399
you can see here we've got a small piece

47
00:01:45,399 --> 00:01:47,580
you can see here we've got a small piece
added to make the tail with these curved

48
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:47,590
added to make the tail with these curved

49
00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:49,950
added to make the tail with these curved
shapes you can stick pieces on any point

50
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:49,960
shapes you can stick pieces on any point

51
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:52,050
shapes you can stick pieces on any point
on the curve and they'll stick out at a

52
00:01:52,050 --> 00:01:52,060
on the curve and they'll stick out at a

53
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:54,389
on the curve and they'll stick out at a
different angle so it's quite fun to

54
00:01:54,389 --> 00:01:54,399
different angle so it's quite fun to

55
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:57,690
different angle so it's quite fun to
play with there's another example here

56
00:01:57,690 --> 00:01:57,700
play with there's another example here

57
00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:01,469
play with there's another example here
in this case this is based on the v-fold

58
00:02:01,469 --> 00:02:01,479
in this case this is based on the v-fold

59
00:02:01,479 --> 00:02:04,109
in this case this is based on the v-fold
and in this case the ears these are the

60
00:02:04,109 --> 00:02:04,119
and in this case the ears these are the

61
00:02:04,119 --> 00:02:06,779
and in this case the ears these are the
tabs that glue the piece to the page and

62
00:02:06,779 --> 00:02:06,789
tabs that glue the piece to the page and

63
00:02:06,789 --> 00:02:09,270
tabs that glue the piece to the page and
the whole thing is quite a solid rigid

64
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:09,280
the whole thing is quite a solid rigid

65
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,580
the whole thing is quite a solid rigid
structure so you can cut chunks away

66
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:11,590
structure so you can cut chunks away

67
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:12,460
structure so you can cut chunks away
like the

68
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:12,470
like the

69
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:21,940
like the
the math of the dog has been cut away so

70
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:21,950
the math of the dog has been cut away so

71
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:23,440
the math of the dog has been cut away so
I'll just start by showing you how to

really well and make this into a V fold

84
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:48,050
really well and make this into a V fold

85
00:02:48,050 --> 00:02:51,880
really well and make this into a V fold
as we did in tutorial 2 so you make a

86
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:51,890
as we did in tutorial 2 so you make a

87
00:02:51,890 --> 00:02:54,490
as we did in tutorial 2 so you make a
crease like this this is the first

88
00:02:54,490 --> 00:02:54,500
crease like this this is the first

89
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:56,950
crease like this this is the first
crease up this side what you're making

90
00:02:56,950 --> 00:02:56,960
crease up this side what you're making

91
00:02:56,960 --> 00:03:01,150
crease up this side what you're making
here is a pair of folds that give you a

92
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:01,160
here is a pair of folds that give you a

93
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:03,640
here is a pair of folds that give you a
sort of downward pointing arrow and just

94
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:03,650
sort of downward pointing arrow and just

95
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:09,810
sort of downward pointing arrow and just
cut that to make a couple of gluing tabs

96
00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:09,820


97
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:13,960
so here's the piece now make another

98
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:13,970
so here's the piece now make another

99
00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:17,560
so here's the piece now make another
fold it can be any angle really

100
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:17,570
fold it can be any angle really

101
00:03:17,570 --> 00:03:19,420
fold it can be any angle really
depending on what shape you want to

102
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:19,430
depending on what shape you want to

103
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:24,430
depending on what shape you want to
create so make something like this fold

104
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:24,440
create so make something like this fold

105
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:29,590
create so make something like this fold
that back on itself open it up so now

106
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:29,600
that back on itself open it up so now

107
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:30,880
that back on itself open it up so now
you've got another downward pointing

108
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:30,890
you've got another downward pointing

109
00:03:30,890 --> 00:03:36,460
you've got another downward pointing
arrow cut out one side of it so you're

110
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:36,470
arrow cut out one side of it so you're

111
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:41,410
arrow cut out one side of it so you're
cutting a longer crease so here you've

112
00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:41,420
cutting a longer crease so here you've

113
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:44,320
cutting a longer crease so here you've
got a cottage that is matching this this

114
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:44,330
got a cottage that is matching this this

115
00:03:44,330 --> 00:03:46,509
got a cottage that is matching this this
folded edge the other side you make that

116
00:03:46,509 --> 00:03:46,519
folded edge the other side you make that

117
00:03:46,519 --> 00:03:54,370
folded edge the other side you make that
into a gluing tab and fold that down and

118
00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:54,380
into a gluing tab and fold that down and

119
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:58,870
into a gluing tab and fold that down and
crease it well so this is now just going

120
00:03:58,870 --> 00:03:58,880
crease it well so this is now just going

121
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:07,960
crease it well so this is now just going
to fold shut like that put your glue

122
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:07,970


123
00:04:07,970 --> 00:04:11,330
put it on the put it on the tab here we

124
00:04:11,330 --> 00:04:11,340
put it on the put it on the tab here we

125
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:14,920
put it on the put it on the tab here we
are

126
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:14,930


127
00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:17,420
fold it shut and now the whole piece

128
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:17,430
fold it shut and now the whole piece

129
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:21,290
fold it shut and now the whole piece
should just go flat and according to how

130
00:04:21,290 --> 00:04:21,300
should just go flat and according to how

131
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:23,510
should just go flat and according to how
you stick it down that will affect what

132
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:23,520
you stick it down that will affect what

133
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:25,670
you stick it down that will affect what
shape you create and so we're going to

134
00:04:25,670 --> 00:04:25,680
shape you create and so we're going to

135
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:28,430
shape you create and so we're going to
stick it here into this gully created on

136
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:28,440
stick it here into this gully created on

137
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:31,880
stick it here into this gully created on

to centimeters two and a half

193
00:06:25,030 --> 00:06:27,000
to centimeters two and a half
centimeters something like that so you

194
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:27,010
centimeters something like that so you

195
00:06:27,010 --> 00:06:32,220
centimeters something like that so you
can cut cut away the bulk of what you

196
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:32,230
can cut cut away the bulk of what you

197
00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:36,180
can cut cut away the bulk of what you
folded so you have a piece like this

198
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:36,190
folded so you have a piece like this

199
00:06:36,190 --> 00:06:38,610
folded so you have a piece like this
open up you've got a tab on each side

200
00:06:38,610 --> 00:06:38,620
open up you've got a tab on each side

201
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:44,990
open up you've got a tab on each side
you can reinforce those individually now

202
00:06:44,990 --> 00:06:45,000


203
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:51,660
now take a pencil and starting you make

204
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:51,670
now take a pencil and starting you make

205
00:06:51,670 --> 00:06:55,430
now take a pencil and starting you make
a mark on the top this is the top crease

206
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:55,440
a mark on the top this is the top crease

207
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:59,940
a mark on the top this is the top crease
so make two marks that are in line with

208
00:06:59,940 --> 00:06:59,950
so make two marks that are in line with

209
00:06:59,950 --> 00:07:01,950
so make two marks that are in line with
deep with the corners of the tab so

210
00:07:01,950 --> 00:07:01,960
deep with the corners of the tab so

211
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:04,650
deep with the corners of the tab so
you've got two marks like this make two

212
00:07:04,650 --> 00:07:04,660
you've got two marks like this make two

213
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:07,800
you've got two marks like this make two
more marks about a third of the way up

214
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:07,810
more marks about a third of the way up

215
00:07:07,810 --> 00:07:12,780
more marks about a third of the way up
the outer edges so this is going to be

216
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:12,790
the outer edges so this is going to be

217
00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:15,690
the outer edges so this is going to be
your curve so you can draw your curve on

218
00:07:15,690 --> 00:07:15,700
your curve so you can draw your curve on

219
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:21,150
your curve so you can draw your curve on
to it something like this and then you

220
00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:21,160
to it something like this and then you

221
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:24,360
to it something like this and then you
you break this curve down into a series

222
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:24,370
you break this curve down into a series

223
00:07:24,370 --> 00:07:27,030
you break this curve down into a series
of short straight edges so I'll just go

224
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:27,040
of short straight edges so I'll just go

225
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:30,090
of short straight edges so I'll just go
for two so you make a mark like this and

226
00:07:30,090 --> 00:07:30,100
for two so you make a mark like this and

227
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:32,730
for two so you make a mark like this and
this now these are going to be straight

228
00:07:32,730 --> 00:07:32,740
this now these are going to be straight

229
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:38,940
this now these are going to be straight
edges here so you start by just cutting

230
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:38,950
edges here so you start by just cutting

231
00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:41,430
edges here so you start by just cutting
out this is crucial you just cut it on

232
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:41,440
out this is crucial you just cut it on

233
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:49,080
out this is crucial you just cut it on
one side so cut out here and cut these

234
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:49,090
one side so cut out here and cut these

235
00:07:49,090 --> 00:07:56,790
one side so cut out here and cut these
straight lines

236
00:07:56,790 --> 00:07:56,800


237
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:10,600
and the same on this side okay so you

238
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:10,610
and the same on this side okay so you

239
00:08:10,610 --> 00:08:14,739
and the same on this side okay so you
have a piece like this now fold it into

240
00:08:14,739 --> 00:08:14,749
have a piece like this now fold it into

241
00:08:14,749 --> 00:08:18,089
have a piece like this now fold it into
its closed position and mark where those

242
00:08:18,089 --> 00:08:18,099
its closed position and mark where those

243
00:08:18,099 --> 00:08:28,300
its closed position and mark where those
those cup lines lie so here they are so

244
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:28,310
those cup lines lie so here they are so

245
00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:30,730
those cup lines lie so here they are so
when you open this up now you can see

246
00:08:30,730 --> 00:08:30,740
when you open this up now you can see

247
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:32,380
when you open this up now you can see
you've got lines that exactly match the

248
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:32,390
you've got lines that exactly match the

249
00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:35,649
you've got lines that exactly match the
cut lines so these are going to be tabs

250
00:08:35,649 --> 00:08:35,659
cut lines so these are going to be tabs

251
00:08:35,659 --> 00:08:51,390
cut lines so these are going to be tabs
built onto those so cut away

252
00:08:51,390 --> 00:08:51,400


253
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:54,430
now you can fold ice to make the tabs

254
00:08:54,430 --> 00:08:54,440
now you can fold ice to make the tabs

255
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:57,220
now you can fold ice to make the tabs
fold along those lines fold them back on

256
00:08:57,220 --> 00:08:57,230
fold along those lines fold them back on

257
00:08:57,230 --> 00:08:59,640
fold along those lines fold them back on
themselves

258
00:08:59,640 --> 00:08:59,650


259
00:08:59,650 --> 00:09:02,800
there we go make sure the creases are

260
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:02,810
there we go make sure the creases are

261
00:09:02,810 --> 00:09:05,740
there we go make sure the creases are
pretty good and then in this case you

262
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:05,750
pretty good and then in this case you

263
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:09,220
pretty good and then in this case you
put glue on all four tabs at the same

264
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:09,230
put glue on all four tabs at the same

265
00:09:09,230 --> 00:09:27,540
put glue on all four tabs at the same
time and then you can just fold it down

266
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:27,550
time and then you can just fold it down

267
00:09:27,550 --> 00:09:37,320
time and then you can just fold it down
and fold the whole piece right

268
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:37,330


269
00:09:37,330 --> 00:09:39,690
so just make sure that it's all all

270
00:09:39,690 --> 00:09:39,700
so just make sure that it's all all

271
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:42,889
so just make sure that it's all all
working okay that it opens up nicely now

272
00:09:42,889 --> 00:09:42,899
working okay that it opens up nicely now

273
00:09:42,899 --> 00:09:46,710
working okay that it opens up nicely now

00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:48,640
something like this but you'll see

277
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:51,990
something like this but you'll see
because these corners are still there it

278
00:09:51,990 --> 00:09:52,000
because these corners are still there it

279
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,120
because these corners are still there it
bags into the page so you're going to

280
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:54,130
bags into the page so you're going to

281
00:09:54,130 --> 00:09:57,269
bags into the page so you're going to
have to cut these off in a curve to

282
00:09:57,269 --> 00:09:57,279
have to cut these off in a curve to

283
00:09:57,279 --> 00:09:59,610
have to cut these off in a curve to
match the page and it all depends what

00:09:59,610 --> 00:09:59,620
match the page and it all depends what

285
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:01,860
match the page and it all depends what
angle you cut it out all depends on how

286
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:01,870
angle you cut it out all depends on how

287
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:05,190
angle you cut it out all depends on how
wide you going with the the basic shape

288
00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:05,200
wide you going with the the basic shape

289
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:17,819

so let's just try it right like that no

290
00:10:17,819 --> 00:10:17,829
so let's just try it right like that no

291
00:10:17,829 --> 00:10:20,370
so let's just try it right like that no

from the spine stick down one side so

302
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:39,670
from the spine stick down one side so

303
00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:43,650
from the spine stick down one side so
it's about there put glue on the other

304
00:10:43,650 --> 00:10:43,660
it's about there put glue on the other

305
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:54,940
it's about there put glue on the other
side close it down

307
00:10:54,950 --> 00:10:58,580
takes quite a lot of strain this so you

308
00:10:58,580 --> 00:10:58,590
takes quite a lot of strain this so you

309
00:10:58,590 --> 00:11:00,710
takes quite a lot of strain this so you
know make sure it's it's glue really

310
