00:00:34,199 --> 00:00:37,020
this is about how to make a lion card

4
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:37,030
this is about how to make a lion card

5
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:39,059
this is about how to make a lion card
which is very good for birthdays so this

6
00:00:39,059 --> 00:00:39,069
which is very good for birthdays so this

00:00:41,829 --> 00:00:44,939
is a birthday lion card it's based on
curved shapes which is tutorial 13 I've

10
00:00:44,939 --> 00:00:44,949
curved shapes which is tutorial 13 I've

11
00:00:44,949 --> 00:00:47,939
curved shapes which is tutorial 13 I've
got some pre-cut pieces here with all

12
00:00:47,939 --> 00:00:47,949
got some pre-cut pieces here with all

13
00:00:47,949 --> 00:00:50,219
got some pre-cut pieces here with all
the dimensions on them to make one

14
00:00:50,219 --> 00:00:50,229
the dimensions on them to make one

15
00:00:50,229 --> 00:00:53,849

exactly like this you can actually do it

16
00:00:53,849 --> 00:00:53,859
exactly like this you can actually do it

17
00:00:53,859 --> 00:00:55,619
exactly like this you can actually do it
by eye in which case you might get

18
00:00:55,619 --> 00:00:55,629
by eye in which case you might get

19
00:00:55,629 --> 00:00:57,239
by eye in which case you might get
slightly different shapes you might want

20
00:00:57,239 --> 00:00:57,249
slightly different shapes you might want

21
00:00:57,249 --> 00:00:58,709
slightly different shapes you might want
to play around with it but if you want

22
00:00:58,709 --> 00:00:58,719
to play around with it but if you want

23
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:03,180
to play around with it but if you want
one just like this this is the top jaw

24
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:03,190
one just like this this is the top jaw

25
00:01:03,190 --> 00:01:06,420
one just like this this is the top jaw
and this is the bottom jaw and so the

26
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:06,430
and this is the bottom jaw and so the

27
00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:10,080
and this is the bottom jaw and so the
dimensions are the length along here

28
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:10,090
dimensions are the length along here

29
00:01:10,090 --> 00:01:13,080
dimensions are the length along here
along here this is eight so this is

30
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:13,090
along here this is eight so this is

31
00:01:13,090 --> 00:01:15,420
along here this is eight so this is
eight centimeters this length here eight

32
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:15,430
eight centimeters this length here eight

33
00:01:15,430 --> 00:01:17,969
eight centimeters this length here eight

00:01:20,849 --> 00:01:20,859
this is six centimeters and then this is

37
00:01:20,859 --> 00:01:23,459
this is six centimeters and then this is
another six centimeters you need three

38
00:01:23,459 --> 00:01:23,469
another six centimeters you need three

it is you just fold it in half like this

60
00:01:52,349 --> 00:01:52,359
it is you just fold it in half like this

61
00:01:52,359 --> 00:01:55,080
it is you just fold it in half like this
and then you can measure this 130 and

62
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:55,090
and then you can measure this 130 and

63
00:01:55,090 --> 00:01:57,630
and then you can measure this 130 and
then you've just cut out one side and

64
00:01:57,630 --> 00:01:57,640
then you've just cut out one side and

65
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:59,819
then you've just cut out one side and
leave a tab on the other side it's all

just stick this onto here so you can

104
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:49,470
just stick this onto here so you can

105
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:54,140
just stick this onto here so you can
just see how it's going to look because

106
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:54,150
just see how it's going to look because

107
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:56,630
just see how it's going to look because
I measured it you can actually stick all

108
00:02:56,630 --> 00:02:56,640
I measured it you can actually stick all

109
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:59,360
I measured it you can actually stick all
the tabs at the same time I'll stick and

110
00:02:59,360 --> 00:02:59,370
the tabs at the same time I'll stick and

111
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:09,050
the tabs at the same time I'll stick and
Dan sticking out normally we stick down

112
00:03:09,050 --> 00:03:09,060
Dan sticking out normally we stick down

113
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:11,599
Dan sticking out normally we stick down
one sides fold it closed put glue on the

114
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:11,609
one sides fold it closed put glue on the

115
00:03:11,609 --> 00:03:13,039
one sides fold it closed put glue on the
other side and fold the whole base

116
00:03:13,039 --> 00:03:13,049
other side and fold the whole base

117
00:03:13,049 --> 00:03:14,780
other side and fold the whole base
closed so they find their natural place

118
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:14,790
closed so they find their natural place

119
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:16,819
closed so they find their natural place
but in this case because it's all

120
00:03:16,819 --> 00:03:16,829
but in this case because it's all

121
00:03:16,829 --> 00:03:19,039
but in this case because it's all
measured we can stick both sides down at

122
00:03:19,039 --> 00:03:19,049
measured we can stick both sides down at

123
00:03:19,049 --> 00:03:28,460
measured we can stick both sides down at
the same time

124
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:28,470


125
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:30,800
that's the first one and just to make

126
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:30,810
that's the first one and just to make

127
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:33,710
that's the first one and just to make
sure it sounds we will close it down in

128
00:03:33,710 --> 00:03:33,720
sure it sounds we will close it down in

129
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:38,120
sure it sounds we will close it down in
case my measurings been a bit dodgy yeah

130
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:38,130
case my measurings been a bit dodgy yeah

131
00:03:38,130 --> 00:03:42,280
case my measurings been a bit dodgy yeah
so that's the bottom jaw the top jaw

132
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:42,290
so that's the bottom jaw the top jaw

133
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:45,290
so that's the bottom jaw the top jaw
glue it closed first so you get the

134
00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:45,300
glue it closed first so you get the

135
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:47,810
glue it closed first so you get the
rounded shape so we just put glue on

136
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:47,820
rounded shape so we just put glue on

137
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:51,170
rounded shape so we just put glue on
that tap smear the glue right up to the

138
00:03:51,170 --> 00:03:51,180
that tap smear the glue right up to the

139
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:53,650
that tap smear the glue right up to the
crease that's the important thing

140
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:53,660
crease that's the important thing

141
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:57,890
crease that's the important thing
fold it shut when it's glued this piece

142
00:03:57,890 --> 00:03:57,900
fold it shut when it's glued this piece

143
00:03:57,900 --> 00:03:59,630
fold it shut when it's glued this piece
should just be able to be completely

144
00:03:59,630 --> 00:03:59,640
should just be able to be completely

145
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:04,550
should just be able to be completely
flat so then again we can stick that to

146
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:04,560
flat so then again we can stick that to

147
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:09,500
flat so then again we can stick that to
these lines we can put glue on both tabs

148
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:09,510
these lines we can put glue on both tabs

149
00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:11,600
these lines we can put glue on both tabs
at the same time I'll just turn it round

150
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:11,610
at the same time I'll just turn it round

151
00:04:11,610 --> 00:04:15,230
at the same time I'll just turn it round
so I can actually see the lines from the

152
00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:15,240
so I can actually see the lines from the

153
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:24,380
so I can actually see the lines from the
inside so put glue on these two again

154
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:24,390
inside so put glue on these two again

155
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:26,180
inside so put glue on these two again
right up to the crease that's the

156
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:26,190
right up to the crease that's the

157
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:33,830
right up to the crease that's the
important thing so stuck that down to

158
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:33,840
important thing so stuck that down to

159
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:36,860
important thing so stuck that down to
the lines I'll just close it down just

160
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:36,870
the lines I'll just close it down just

161
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:44,240
the lines I'll just close it down just
to make sure it all goes flat so this is

162
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:44,250
to make sure it all goes flat so this is

163
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:46,970
to make sure it all goes flat so this is
your basic head shape using the curved

164
00:04:46,970 --> 00:04:46,980
your basic head shape using the curved
