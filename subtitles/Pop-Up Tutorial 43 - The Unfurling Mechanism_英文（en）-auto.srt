3
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:39,380
this tutorial is about the unfurling

4
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:39,390
this tutorial is about the unfurling

5
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:42,440
this tutorial is about the unfurling
mechanism it's a quite an unusual little

6
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:42,450
mechanism it's a quite an unusual little

7
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:45,640
mechanism it's a quite an unusual little
mechanism that I took from this book by

8
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:45,650
mechanism that I took from this book by

9
00:00:45,650 --> 00:00:49,070
mechanism that I took from this book by
David Pellom called the Raven really

10
00:00:49,070 --> 00:00:49,080
David Pellom called the Raven really

11
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:50,840
David Pellom called the Raven really
fantastic but really beautiful

12
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:50,850
fantastic but really beautiful

13
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:53,810
fantastic but really beautiful
illustration and very clever pop-ups so

14
00:00:53,810 --> 00:00:53,820
illustration and very clever pop-ups so

15
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:55,880
illustration and very clever pop-ups so
I'll just run through it so you can see

16
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:55,890
I'll just run through it so you can see

17
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:59,180
I'll just run through it so you can see
just how great it is really and then

18
00:00:59,180 --> 00:00:59,190
just how great it is really and then

19
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:02,180
just how great it is really and then
I'll explain the unfurling mechanism at

20
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:02,190
I'll explain the unfurling mechanism at

21
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:15,380
I'll explain the unfurling mechanism at
the end these are the spreads so this is

22
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:15,390
the end these are the spreads so this is

23
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:17,300
the end these are the spreads so this is
the unfolding mechanism this is the one

24
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:17,310
the unfolding mechanism this is the one

25
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:19,670
the unfolding mechanism this is the one
I'm going to explain in this tutorial

26
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:19,680
I'm going to explain in this tutorial

27
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:23,740
I'm going to explain in this tutorial
and then this is the end of the book

28
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:23,750
and then this is the end of the book

29
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:27,260
and then this is the end of the book
this is the unfurling mechanism I think

30
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:27,270
this is the unfurling mechanism I think

31
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:30,260
this is the unfurling mechanism I think
the best way to understand it is to look

32
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:30,270
the best way to understand it is to look

33
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:33,260
the best way to understand it is to look
at it from behind you'll see that the

34
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:33,270
at it from behind you'll see that the

35
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:37,550
at it from behind you'll see that the
whole thing is powered by a v-fold in

36
00:01:37,550 --> 00:01:37,560
whole thing is powered by a v-fold in

37
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:40,250
whole thing is powered by a v-fold in
here and the v-fold is the type of

38
00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:40,260
here and the v-fold is the type of

39
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:42,170
here and the v-fold is the type of
v-fold where the angles on the v-fold

40
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:42,180
v-fold where the angles on the v-fold

41
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:44,270
v-fold where the angles on the v-fold
are the same as the angles on the page

42
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:44,280
are the same as the angles on the page

43
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:47,810
are the same as the angles on the page
so when the page is flat the v-fold lies

44
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:47,820
so when the page is flat the v-fold lies

45
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:50,300
so when the page is flat the v-fold lies
flat the v-fold is extended up and

46
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:50,310
flat the v-fold is extended up and

47
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:52,399
flat the v-fold is extended up and
there's a piece that pushes up the back

48
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:52,409
there's a piece that pushes up the back

49
00:01:52,409 --> 00:01:55,250
there's a piece that pushes up the back
of the fingers easiest to show you on

50
00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:55,260
of the fingers easiest to show you on

51
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:58,310
of the fingers easiest to show you on
this one that I've made so I'll put that

52
00:01:58,310 --> 00:01:58,320
this one that I've made so I'll put that

53
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:03,760
this one that I've made so I'll put that
there so here it is this is the V fault

54
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:03,770
there so here it is this is the V fault

55
00:02:03,770 --> 00:02:06,980
there so here it is this is the V fault
this would be the front of the hand this

56
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:06,990
this would be the front of the hand this

57
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:09,139
this would be the front of the hand this
is the piece that pushes up the fingers

58
00:02:09,139 --> 00:02:09,149
is the piece that pushes up the fingers

59
00:02:09,149 --> 00:02:13,240
is the piece that pushes up the fingers
it pushes up at the back here and the

60
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:13,250
it pushes up at the back here and the

61
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:15,610
it pushes up at the back here and the
the finger is actually hinged on the top

62
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:15,620
the finger is actually hinged on the top

63
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:18,310
the finger is actually hinged on the top
of this extension to the v-fold so as it

64
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:18,320
of this extension to the v-fold so as it

65
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:21,880
of this extension to the v-fold so as it
opens and closes you can see how that

66
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:21,890
opens and closes you can see how that

67
00:02:21,890 --> 00:02:27,250
opens and closes you can see how that
works in the book rather than to just

68
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:27,260
works in the book rather than to just

69
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:29,830
works in the book rather than to just
being one flat level here yellow as I've

70
00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:29,840
being one flat level here yellow as I've

71
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,510
being one flat level here yellow as I've
made there's a whole series of different

72
00:02:31,510 --> 00:02:31,520
made there's a whole series of different

73
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:34,900
made there's a whole series of different
heights for the different fingers so if

74
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:34,910
heights for the different fingers so if

75
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:37,690
heights for the different fingers so if
we look at it sideways on here there's a

76
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:37,700
we look at it sideways on here there's a

77
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:40,210
we look at it sideways on here there's a
whole lot of different heights to all

78
00:02:40,210 --> 00:02:40,220
whole lot of different heights to all

79
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:42,070
whole lot of different heights to all
different shapes but all pushed up by

80
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:42,080
different shapes but all pushed up by

81
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:45,310
different shapes but all pushed up by
the the piece that's pushing it has all

82
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:45,320
the the piece that's pushing it has all

83
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:47,470
the the piece that's pushing it has all
these different levels and the piece

84
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:47,480
these different levels and the piece

85
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:49,720
these different levels and the piece
that it's pushing against has different

86
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:49,730
that it's pushing against has different

87
00:02:49,730 --> 00:02:51,880
that it's pushing against has different
levels so when you look at this it would

88
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:51,890
levels so when you look at this it would

89
00:02:51,890 --> 00:02:54,400
levels so when you look at this it would
be really the yellow piece would have

90
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:54,410
be really the yellow piece would have

91
00:02:54,410 --> 00:02:57,130
be really the yellow piece would have
different levels and also the red piece

92
00:02:57,130 --> 00:02:57,140
different levels and also the red piece

93
00:02:57,140 --> 00:02:58,810
different levels and also the red piece
would have different levels but I've

94
00:02:58,810 --> 00:02:58,820
would have different levels but I've

95
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:01,750
would have different levels but I've
just made one to make it clear so you

96
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:01,760
just made one to make it clear so you

97
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,350
just made one to make it clear so you
can understand it so now I'll make one

98
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:04,360
can understand it so now I'll make one

99
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:07,510
can understand it so now I'll make one
I've cut out all the pieces in advance

100
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:07,520
I've cut out all the pieces in advance

101
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,949
I've cut out all the pieces in advance
so I'll explain them all they're all

102
00:03:08,949 --> 00:03:08,959
so I'll explain them all they're all

103
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:12,270
so I'll explain them all they're all
quite simple this is the base sheet

104
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:12,280
quite simple this is the base sheet

105
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:17,460
quite simple this is the base sheet
folded in half folded really thoroughly

106
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:17,470


107
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:21,250
this is the V fold both these angles are

108
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:21,260
this is the V fold both these angles are

109
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:24,699
this is the V fold both these angles are
45 degrees I have increased it yes I'll

110
00:03:24,699 --> 00:03:24,709
45 degrees I have increased it yes I'll

111
00:03:24,709 --> 00:03:30,070
45 degrees I have increased it yes I'll
just crease that now so that crease

112
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:30,080
just crease that now so that crease

113
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:33,610
just crease that now so that crease
really thoroughly you look at this you

114
00:03:33,610 --> 00:03:33,620
really thoroughly you look at this you

115
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:36,340
really thoroughly you look at this you
can see where it's positioned on the

116
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:36,350
can see where it's positioned on the

117
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:41,920
can see where it's positioned on the
page so that piece is going to be the V

118
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:41,930
page so that piece is going to be the V

119
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:44,440
page so that piece is going to be the V
it'll be near the top of the page

120
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:44,450
it'll be near the top of the page

121
00:03:44,450 --> 00:03:49,229
it'll be near the top of the page
pointing down it something like this

122
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:49,239
pointing down it something like this

123
00:03:49,239 --> 00:03:53,500
pointing down it something like this
that's about right so I'll just put the

124
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:53,510
that's about right so I'll just put the

125
00:03:53,510 --> 00:03:57,699
that's about right so I'll just put the
glue on there and as it's flat when the

126
00:03:57,699 --> 00:03:57,709
glue on there and as it's flat when the

127
00:03:57,709 --> 00:03:59,710
glue on there and as it's flat when the
pop-up is flat you can glue both sides

128
00:03:59,710 --> 00:03:59,720
pop-up is flat you can glue both sides

129
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:06,309
pop-up is flat you can glue both sides
at the same time

130
00:04:06,309 --> 00:04:06,319


131
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:08,610
I'll position it on there make sure the

132
00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:08,620
I'll position it on there make sure the

133
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:12,819
I'll position it on there make sure the
central crease of the pop-up is

134
00:04:12,819 --> 00:04:12,829
central crease of the pop-up is

135
00:04:12,829 --> 00:04:14,999
central crease of the pop-up is
with the central crease of the base

136
00:04:14,999 --> 00:04:15,009
with the central crease of the base

137
00:04:15,009 --> 00:04:18,849
with the central crease of the base
stick it down fold it shut just to make

138
00:04:18,849 --> 00:04:18,859
stick it down fold it shut just to make

139
00:04:18,859 --> 00:04:21,129
stick it down fold it shut just to make
sure that everything is working smoothly

140
00:04:21,129 --> 00:04:21,139
sure that everything is working smoothly

141
00:04:21,139 --> 00:04:24,850
sure that everything is working smoothly
oh yeah

142
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:24,860
oh yeah

143
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:27,960
oh yeah
so now you'll see that this yellow piece

144
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:27,970
so now you'll see that this yellow piece

145
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:31,540
so now you'll see that this yellow piece
is stuck to one side of the v-fold so

146
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:31,550
is stuck to one side of the v-fold so

147
00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:33,820
is stuck to one side of the v-fold so
here's the yellow piece I'm going to add

148
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:33,830
here's the yellow piece I'm going to add

149
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:36,760
here's the yellow piece I'm going to add
on and you can see that that yellow

150
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:36,770
on and you can see that that yellow

151
00:04:36,770 --> 00:04:39,159
on and you can see that that yellow
piece is glued to one side of the v-fold

152
00:04:39,159 --> 00:04:39,169
piece is glued to one side of the v-fold

153
00:04:39,169 --> 00:04:42,969
piece is glued to one side of the v-fold
so here's the yellow piece that low

154
00:04:42,969 --> 00:04:42,979
so here's the yellow piece that low

155
00:04:42,979 --> 00:04:46,740
so here's the yellow piece that low
yellow piece and it's going to be glued

156
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:46,750
yellow piece and it's going to be glued

157
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:50,800
yellow piece and it's going to be glued
to this side of the v-fold make sure the

158
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:50,810
to this side of the v-fold make sure the

159
00:04:50,810 --> 00:04:53,490
to this side of the v-fold make sure the
corner is right in the corner otherwise

160
00:04:53,490 --> 00:04:53,500
corner is right in the corner otherwise

161
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:56,020
corner is right in the corner otherwise
well it obviously won't won't close

162
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:56,030
well it obviously won't won't close

163
00:04:56,030 --> 00:04:59,920
well it obviously won't won't close
properly so put some glue on this

164
00:04:59,920 --> 00:04:59,930
properly so put some glue on this

165
00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:09,640
properly so put some glue on this
triangle here bit too much glue there

166
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:09,650
triangle here bit too much glue there

167
00:05:09,650 --> 00:05:11,950
triangle here bit too much glue there
I'll just give it a moment to dry off

168
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:11,960
I'll just give it a moment to dry off

169
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:17,409
I'll just give it a moment to dry off
I'll close it make sure it's working and

170
00:05:17,409 --> 00:05:17,419
I'll close it make sure it's working and

171
00:05:17,419 --> 00:05:20,460
I'll close it make sure it's working and
give that a minute now the second piece

172
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:20,470
give that a minute now the second piece

173
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:23,350
give that a minute now the second piece
this is a piece here with the slot in it

174
00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:23,360
this is a piece here with the slot in it

175
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:26,680
this is a piece here with the slot in it
that the red piece goes through so

176
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:26,690
that the red piece goes through so

177
00:05:26,690 --> 00:05:30,760
that the red piece goes through so
that's going to go on here the slot is

178
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:30,770
that's going to go on here the slot is

179
00:05:30,770 --> 00:05:33,610
that's going to go on here the slot is
going to be just above the level here

180
00:05:33,610 --> 00:05:33,620
going to be just above the level here

181
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:35,439
going to be just above the level here
you could probably make it all out of

182
00:05:35,439 --> 00:05:35,449
you could probably make it all out of

183
00:05:35,449 --> 00:05:38,080
you could probably make it all out of
one card but I think it's also quite

184
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:38,090
one card but I think it's also quite

185
00:05:38,090 --> 00:05:40,149
one card but I think it's also quite
good to keep it tough so it's several

186
00:05:40,149 --> 00:05:40,159
good to keep it tough so it's several

187
00:05:40,159 --> 00:05:42,909
good to keep it tough so it's several
thicknesses so I've marked slots it's

188
00:05:42,909 --> 00:05:42,919
thicknesses so I've marked slots it's

189
00:05:42,919 --> 00:05:44,409
thicknesses so I've marked slots it's
going to be parallel with the crease at

190
00:05:44,409 --> 00:05:44,419
going to be parallel with the crease at

191
00:05:44,419 --> 00:05:59,040
going to be parallel with the crease at
the bottom I've just cut it out

192
00:05:59,040 --> 00:05:59,050


193
00:05:59,050 --> 00:06:00,370
okay

194
00:06:00,370 --> 00:06:00,380
okay

195
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:03,909
okay
that needs to be just above the top

196
00:06:03,909 --> 00:06:03,919
that needs to be just above the top

197
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:07,540
that needs to be just above the top
edge and I'll just glue that one on as

198
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:07,550
edge and I'll just glue that one on as

199
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:17,469
edge and I'll just glue that one on as
well right again I'll just close it make

200
00:06:17,469 --> 00:06:17,479
well right again I'll just close it make

201
00:06:17,479 --> 00:06:20,650
well right again I'll just close it make
sure it all works this is obviously a

202
00:06:20,650 --> 00:06:20,660
sure it all works this is obviously a

203
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:22,510
sure it all works this is obviously a
dummy you can see it sticking out of the

204
00:06:22,510 --> 00:06:22,520
dummy you can see it sticking out of the

205
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:24,400
dummy you can see it sticking out of the
edge but it doesn't matter it's just

206
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:24,410
edge but it doesn't matter it's just

207
00:06:24,410 --> 00:06:26,499
edge but it doesn't matter it's just
explaining the mechanisms so there we

208
00:06:26,499 --> 00:06:26,509
explaining the mechanisms so there we

209
00:06:26,509 --> 00:06:29,620
explaining the mechanisms so there we
are that's moving like that now the red

210
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:29,630
are that's moving like that now the red

211
00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:31,540
are that's moving like that now the red
piece this is going to be pushing up the

212
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:31,550
piece this is going to be pushing up the

213
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:33,670
piece this is going to be pushing up the
whole thing this is what actually makes

214
00:06:33,670 --> 00:06:33,680
whole thing this is what actually makes

215
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:36,180
whole thing this is what actually makes
the mechanism moving the way it does so

216
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:36,190
the mechanism moving the way it does so

217
00:06:36,190 --> 00:06:39,670
the mechanism moving the way it does so
here's the strip I've made it's got a

218
00:06:39,670 --> 00:06:39,680
here's the strip I've made it's got a

219
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:42,249
here's the strip I've made it's got a
crease down the middle I'm going to glue

220
00:06:42,249 --> 00:06:42,259
crease down the middle I'm going to glue

221
00:06:42,259 --> 00:06:43,120
crease down the middle I'm going to glue
it in a minute

222
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:43,130
it in a minute

223
00:06:43,130 --> 00:06:47,740
it in a minute
but first we'll just make a tab at one

224
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:47,750
but first we'll just make a tab at one

225
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:50,559
but first we'll just make a tab at one
end so I'll cut a little piece off there

226
00:06:50,559 --> 00:06:50,569
end so I'll cut a little piece off there

227
00:06:50,569 --> 00:06:55,600
end so I'll cut a little piece off there
so that's going to be a tab that's going

228
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:55,610
so that's going to be a tab that's going

229
00:06:55,610 --> 00:07:00,129
so that's going to be a tab that's going
to glue it onto the page now if we look

230
00:07:00,129 --> 00:07:00,139
to glue it onto the page now if we look

231
00:07:00,139 --> 00:07:03,070
to glue it onto the page now if we look
at this you'll see there's a tab at the

232
00:07:03,070 --> 00:07:03,080
at this you'll see there's a tab at the

233
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:06,459
at this you'll see there's a tab at the
bottom in the book this red piece is all

234
00:07:06,459 --> 00:07:06,469
bottom in the book this red piece is all

235
00:07:06,469 --> 00:07:08,790
bottom in the book this red piece is all
made in one piece but because of the

236
00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:08,800
made in one piece but because of the

237
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,990
made in one piece but because of the
complications with measuring and stuff

238
00:07:10,990 --> 00:07:11,000
complications with measuring and stuff

239
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,640
complications with measuring and stuff
I'm going to make it out of two pieces

240
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:12,650
I'm going to make it out of two pieces

241
00:07:12,650 --> 00:07:15,689
I'm going to make it out of two pieces
this piece that the piece that comes up

242
00:07:15,689 --> 00:07:15,699
this piece that the piece that comes up

243
00:07:15,699 --> 00:07:19,450
this piece that the piece that comes up
that needs to be the same height as the

244
00:07:19,450 --> 00:07:19,460
that needs to be the same height as the

245
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:23,589
that needs to be the same height as the
total yellow so now having made the tab

246
00:07:23,589 --> 00:07:23,599
total yellow so now having made the tab

247
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:27,040
total yellow so now having made the tab
on one end I just need to measure how

248
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:27,050
on one end I just need to measure how

249
00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:30,309
on one end I just need to measure how
high the whole thing needs to come this

250
00:07:30,309 --> 00:07:30,319
high the whole thing needs to come this

251
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:35,830
high the whole thing needs to come this
time so I'll just mark that so that's

252
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:35,840
time so I'll just mark that so that's

253
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:39,159
time so I'll just mark that so that's
flush with the bottom this is where the

254
00:07:39,159 --> 00:07:39,169
flush with the bottom this is where the

255
00:07:39,169 --> 00:07:44,620
flush with the bottom this is where the
other tab is going to be so I'm going to

256
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:44,630
other tab is going to be so I'm going to

257
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:51,939
other tab is going to be so I'm going to
cut that to make a tab on it and cut

258
00:07:51,939 --> 00:07:51,949
cut that to make a tab on it and cut

259
00:07:51,949 --> 00:07:57,920
cut that to make a tab on it and cut
that off

260
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:57,930


261
00:07:57,930 --> 00:08:00,360
right so this is going to be the other

262
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:00,370
right so this is going to be the other

263
00:08:00,370 --> 00:08:05,250
right so this is going to be the other
time now I can glue the two sides

264
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:05,260
time now I can glue the two sides

265
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:07,550
time now I can glue the two sides
together just to make it a really strong

266
00:08:07,550 --> 00:08:07,560
together just to make it a really strong

267
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:17,060
together just to make it a really strong
pushing strut there we go

268
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:17,070
pushing strut there we go

269
00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:22,290
pushing strut there we go
and just while that dries you see here

270
00:08:22,290 --> 00:08:22,300
and just while that dries you see here

271
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:24,540
and just while that dries you see here
because I've made this red piece out of

272
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:24,550
because I've made this red piece out of

273
00:08:24,550 --> 00:08:27,360
because I've made this red piece out of
two pieces I've put a little hinge on

274
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:27,370
two pieces I've put a little hinge on

275
00:08:27,370 --> 00:08:29,700
two pieces I've put a little hinge on
the top of the yellow that's so you can

276
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:29,710
the top of the yellow that's so you can

277
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:33,150
the top of the yellow that's so you can
attach it all so this is the hinge it's

278
00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:33,160
attach it all so this is the hinge it's

279
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:35,190
attach it all so this is the hinge it's
just a small piece with a fold in the

280
00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:35,200
just a small piece with a fold in the

281
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,830
just a small piece with a fold in the
middle needs to be lined up with the

282
00:08:37,830 --> 00:08:37,840
middle needs to be lined up with the

283
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:39,170
middle needs to be lined up with the
slot

284
00:08:39,170 --> 00:08:39,180
slot

285
00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:43,050
slot
put a bit of glue on that and that's

286
00:08:43,050 --> 00:08:43,060
put a bit of glue on that and that's

287
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:53,760
put a bit of glue on that and that's
gonna go there okay now we're gonna

288
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:53,770
gonna go there okay now we're gonna

289
00:08:53,770 --> 00:08:55,710
gonna go there okay now we're gonna
thread this through this is going to

290
00:08:55,710 --> 00:08:55,720
thread this through this is going to

291
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:59,160
thread this through this is going to
stick down it's going to go up

292
00:08:59,160 --> 00:08:59,170
stick down it's going to go up

293
00:08:59,170 --> 00:09:04,230
stick down it's going to go up
through the slot and stick them in the

294
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:04,240
through the slot and stick them in the

295
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:06,840
through the slot and stick them in the
front of the whole thing in line with

296
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:06,850
front of the whole thing in line with

297
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:09,030
front of the whole thing in line with
the hinge I've put on so I'll just put

298
00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:09,040
the hinge I've put on so I'll just put

299
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:17,220
the hinge I've put on so I'll just put
some glue on that tab there stick it

300
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:17,230
some glue on that tab there stick it

301
00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:22,170
some glue on that tab there stick it
down just make sure that's all still

302
00:09:22,170 --> 00:09:22,180
down just make sure that's all still

303
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:26,310
down just make sure that's all still
working nicely clicks as I'm slightly

304
00:09:26,310 --> 00:09:26,320
working nicely clicks as I'm slightly

305
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:33,660
working nicely clicks as I'm slightly
off up there and it's straighter now

306
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:33,670
off up there and it's straighter now

307
00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:37,590
off up there and it's straighter now
when they when the base is flat this is

308
00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:37,600
when they when the base is flat this is

309
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:41,850
when they when the base is flat this is
the whole finger is flat so I'm going to

310
00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:41,860
the whole finger is flat so I'm going to

311
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:44,400
the whole finger is flat so I'm going to
make this flat this is the piece I'm

312
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:44,410
make this flat this is the piece I'm

313
00:09:44,410 --> 00:09:46,890
make this flat this is the piece I'm
going to add on it's going to stick on

314
00:09:46,890 --> 00:09:46,900
going to add on it's going to stick on

315
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:52,020
going to add on it's going to stick on
to this urn this let's close it down so

316
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:52,030
to this urn this let's close it down so

317
00:09:52,030 --> 00:09:55,320
to this urn this let's close it down so
this is going to stick on there and I've

318
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:55,330
this is going to stick on there and I've

319
00:09:55,330 --> 00:09:59,550
this is going to stick on there and I've
just put glue on the two tabs this top

320
00:09:59,550 --> 00:09:59,560
just put glue on the two tabs this top

321
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:01,860
just put glue on the two tabs this top
one on the Reds that should be pointing

322
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:01,870
one on the Reds that should be pointing

323
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:07,860
one on the Reds that should be pointing
this way when you add the finger to it

324
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:07,870
this way when you add the finger to it

325
00:10:07,870 --> 00:10:11,170
this way when you add the finger to it
the end of this strip goes on to that

326
00:10:11,170 --> 00:10:11,180
the end of this strip goes on to that

327
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:15,700
the end of this strip goes on to that
crease as it lies down you can see it's

328
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:15,710
crease as it lies down you can see it's

329
00:10:15,710 --> 00:10:18,280
crease as it lies down you can see it's
going to be too long this is going to

330
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:18,290
going to be too long this is going to

331
00:10:18,290 --> 00:10:21,190
going to be too long this is going to
come down here so I'm going to trim some

332
00:10:21,190 --> 00:10:21,200
come down here so I'm going to trim some

333
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:24,730
come down here so I'm going to trim some
of that off immediately and then fold

334
00:10:24,730 --> 00:10:24,740
of that off immediately and then fold

335
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:29,230
of that off immediately and then fold
this down and that you can see I'm

336
00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:29,240
this down and that you can see I'm

337
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:33,250
this down and that you can see I'm
actually slightly off there so now you

338
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:33,260
actually slightly off there so now you

339
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:37,090
actually slightly off there so now you
can see this is unfurling possibly it's

340
00:10:37,090 --> 00:10:37,100
can see this is unfurling possibly it's

341
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:39,460
can see this is unfurling possibly it's
still slightly long tending to dag into

342
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:39,470
still slightly long tending to dag into

343
00:10:39,470 --> 00:10:41,980
still slightly long tending to dag into
the page a little bit so I could cut off

344
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:41,990
the page a little bit so I could cut off

345
00:10:41,990 --> 00:10:48,370
the page a little bit so I could cut off
a bit more might help then it so this is

346
00:10:48,370 --> 00:10:48,380
a bit more might help then it so this is

347
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:51,730
a bit more might help then it so this is
the this is the unfurling mechanism and

348
00:10:51,730 --> 00:10:51,740
the this is the unfurling mechanism and

349
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:55,360
the this is the unfurling mechanism and
if you want to make multiple fingers

350
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:55,370
if you want to make multiple fingers

351
00:10:55,370 --> 00:10:57,700
if you want to make multiple fingers
like in the hands then you can make the

352
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:57,710
like in the hands then you can make the

353
00:10:57,710 --> 00:11:00,220
like in the hands then you can make the
yellow at lots of different levels and

354
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:00,230
yellow at lots of different levels and

355
00:11:00,230 --> 00:11:02,230
yellow at lots of different levels and
you can make this red piece that's

356
00:11:02,230 --> 00:11:02,240
you can make this red piece that's

357
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,900
you can make this red piece that's
pushing up at lots of different levels

358
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:03,910
pushing up at lots of different levels

359
00:11:03,910 --> 00:11:10,110
pushing up at lots of different levels
the other clever thing with this book is

360
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:10,120


361
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:13,810
this mechanism is hidden in David

362
00:11:13,810 --> 00:11:13,820
this mechanism is hidden in David

363
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:15,940
this mechanism is hidden in David
Pelham's design so I'll just show you

364
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:15,950
Pelham's design so I'll just show you

365
00:11:15,950 --> 00:11:22,030
Pelham's design so I'll just show you
how he's done that when the page opens

366
00:11:22,030 --> 00:11:22,040
how he's done that when the page opens

367
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:24,250
how he's done that when the page opens
you see that the hand is actually

368
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:24,260
you see that the hand is actually

369
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:28,360
you see that the hand is actually
holding a locket and so actually this

370
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:28,370
holding a locket and so actually this

371
00:11:28,370 --> 00:11:31,450
holding a locket and so actually this
locket is attached to the top of the

372
00:11:31,450 --> 00:11:31,460
locket is attached to the top of the

373
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:33,720
locket is attached to the top of the
yellow up here and it slides up and down

374
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:33,730
yellow up here and it slides up and down

375
00:11:33,730 --> 00:11:37,390
yellow up here and it slides up and down
this is a separate piece so if we lift

376
00:11:37,390 --> 00:11:37,400
this is a separate piece so if we lift

377
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:40,660
this is a separate piece so if we lift
that up you'll see that this piece with

378
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:40,670
that up you'll see that this piece with

379
00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:43,300
that up you'll see that this piece with
the thumb is one piece and this is

380
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:43,310
the thumb is one piece and this is

381
00:11:43,310 --> 00:11:45,640
the thumb is one piece and this is
another so that locket actually hides

382
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:45,650
another so that locket actually hides

383
00:11:45,650 --> 00:11:49,390
another so that locket actually hides
that so in effect there's one piece

384
00:11:49,390 --> 00:11:49,400
that so in effect there's one piece

385
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:52,270
that so in effect there's one piece
stuck on here that's coming up and

386
00:11:52,270 --> 00:11:52,280
stuck on here that's coming up and

387
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:53,950
stuck on here that's coming up and
there's another piece stuck on here

388
00:11:53,950 --> 00:11:53,960
there's another piece stuck on here

389
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:56,700
there's another piece stuck on here
that's coming down over and hiding it

390
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:56,710
that's coming down over and hiding it

391
00:11:56,710 --> 00:12:00,070
that's coming down over and hiding it
I'll just make that so you can see how

392
00:12:00,070 --> 00:12:00,080
I'll just make that so you can see how

393
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:01,270
I'll just make that so you can see how
it's hidden I'll make that with a

394
00:12:01,270 --> 00:12:01,280
it's hidden I'll make that with a

395
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:02,890
it's hidden I'll make that with a
different color I'll make that with some

396
00:12:02,890 --> 00:12:02,900
different color I'll make that with some

397
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:06,250
different color I'll make that with some
green so I'll just make it very

398
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:06,260
green so I'll just make it very

399
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:16,580
green so I'll just make it very
basically so

400
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:16,590


401
00:12:16,590 --> 00:12:19,200
so this is going to stick onto the red

402
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:19,210
so this is going to stick onto the red

403
00:12:19,210 --> 00:12:30,960
so this is going to stick onto the red
piece there put a bit of glue on

404
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:30,970


405
00:12:30,970 --> 00:12:37,540
that sticks on there and now there's

406
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:37,550
that sticks on there and now there's

407
00:12:37,550 --> 00:12:47,820
that sticks on there and now there's
another overlapping piece of green

408
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:47,830


409
00:12:47,830 --> 00:12:50,350
there's an overlapping piece of green

410
00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:50,360
there's an overlapping piece of green

411
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:53,410
there's an overlapping piece of green
there so that will hide the the

412
00:12:53,410 --> 00:12:53,420
there so that will hide the the

413
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:59,140
there so that will hide the the
mechanism really just put a small amount

414
00:12:59,140 --> 00:12:59,150
mechanism really just put a small amount

415
00:12:59,150 --> 00:13:04,360
mechanism really just put a small amount
of glue on to stick it on there so stuck

416
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:04,370
of glue on to stick it on there so stuck

417
00:13:04,370 --> 00:13:06,100
of glue on to stick it on there so stuck
nice piece on the top there this is

418
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:06,110
nice piece on the top there this is

419
00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:08,800
nice piece on the top there this is
hiding the mechanism I need to cast it

420
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:08,810
hiding the mechanism I need to cast it

421
00:13:08,810 --> 00:13:12,790
hiding the mechanism I need to cast it
down so that it's long enough to go over

422
00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:12,800
down so that it's long enough to go over

423
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:15,790
down so that it's long enough to go over
the top edge but it's short enough that

424
00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:15,800
the top edge but it's short enough that

425
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:18,190
the top edge but it's short enough that
it doesn't crash into the alley down

426
00:13:18,190 --> 00:13:18,200
it doesn't crash into the alley down

427
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:22,660
it doesn't crash into the alley down
there there it is in the book

428
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:22,670
there there it is in the book

429
00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:24,370
there there it is in the book
obviously you know it's clever it's a

430
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:24,380
obviously you know it's clever it's a

431
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:26,320
obviously you know it's clever it's a
it's a locket so the fact that it's

432
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:26,330
it's a locket so the fact that it's

433
00:13:26,330 --> 00:13:28,740
it's a locket so the fact that it's
moving is it's fine

434
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:28,750
moving is it's fine

435
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:31,820
moving is it's fine
that is the unfolding mechanism

436
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:31,830
that is the unfolding mechanism

437
00:13:31,830 --> 00:13:47,410
that is the unfolding mechanism
