10
00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:44,140
might think of it's based on the right
这就是你的平行四边形

11
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:48,540
might think of it's based on the right

actually use a piece of card as a set
是的，您将有两个标签

57
00:01:50,499 --> 00:01:53,719
actually use a piece of card as a set
square and I'll explain that in a minute
在这里，所以你需要为此评分

here's the template the measurements are
用一张纸牌的一个角

61
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:59,520
here's the template the measurements are
I've drawn it up again here I'm going to
90度角，所以当你来

62
00:01:59,520 --> 00:01:59,530
I've drawn it up again here I'm going to
要测量，您将需要标尺

63
00:01:59,530 --> 00:02:01,529
I've drawn it up again here I'm going to
cut this one out in a minute so you can
在这里测量这些距离，但是你

64
00:02:01,529 --> 00:02:01,539
cut this one out in a minute so you can

walls they're four and a half
以及，所以我会把它切掉

68
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:05,590
walls they're four and a half
快速，您可以使用一对

69
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:11,020
walls they're four and a half
centimeters
剪刀，或者你可以用手工生活

70


像这样，我发现工艺刀是

71
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:18,320
the long walls are 7 centimeters
最快的方法我就剪掉

72


出来真的很快

73
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:20,270
you've got a 1 centimetre tab and
所以这是房子的基本件

74
00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:20,280
you've got a 1 centimetre tab and
确保所有这些角落都是真的

75
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:22,790
you've got a 1 centimetre tab and
another one on the end here that pulls
好

76
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:22,800
another one on the end here that pulls
一如既往地皱折

77
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,610
another one on the end here that pulls
it round and turns it into a rectangle

I've drawn it up here this is the bottom
line you will need to score so I suppose
并确实折起标签

82
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:30,720
line you will need to score so I suppose
彻底地，然后我就把它全部打了

83
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,540
line you will need to score so I suppose
that's another tool you'll need is a
理想的是用墨斗

84
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:32,550
that's another tool you'll need is a
你会用圆珠笔知道

85
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:35,000
that's another tool you'll need is a
ballpoint pen or something similar and
但是随着墨水的渗入，

86
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:35,010
ballpoint pen or something similar and
这些线，所以当您将其折叠成

87
00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:38,420
ballpoint pen or something similar and
so you'll need to score along here where
半形确保那些折线

88
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:38,430
so you'll need to score along here where
在里面，这个标签是

89
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:39,680
so you'll need to score along here where
the two tabs go
把所有东西都放在一起

90
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:39,690
the two tabs go
里面只是放一些胶水

91
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:42,170
the two tabs go
you'll also need to score up here where
胶合后，请确保

92
00:02:42,170 --> 00:02:42,180
you'll also need to score up here where
整个东西实际上会放平，所以

93
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:44,120
you'll also need to score up here where
the tab pulling the whole thing into a
您可以尝试两种方式，然后

94
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:44,130
the tab pulling the whole thing into a
需要一张底纸，将其对折

95
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:45,430
the tab pulling the whole thing into a
rectangle goes
再次彻底地彻底折皱

96
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:45,440
rectangle goes
这需要确保选项卡

97
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:49,550
rectangle goes
you'll also need a roof beam so this
两者都与脊椎成45度角

98
00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:49,560
you'll also need a roof beam so this
不要将它贴在角落上

99
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:51,140
you'll also need a roof beam so this
roof beam I've actually made it three
您必须将它与

100
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:51,150
roof beam I've actually made it three
脊椎所以你可以使用一套

101
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:52,700
roof beam I've actually made it three
centimetres high but it doesn't really
广场给你的指导方针

102
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:52,710
centimetres high but it doesn't really
像这样把它们画出来，所以你知道

103
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:54,620
centimetres high but it doesn't really
matter and again you'll need to score
你要坚持的地方

104
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:54,630
matter and again you'll need to score
向下或再次，您可以使用像

105
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:57,890
matter and again you'll need to score
here because this is a tab and here this
这是一张卡片上的，这样你

106
00:02:57,890 --> 00:02:57,900
here because this is a tab and here this
知道这是90度的折痕

107
00:02:57,900 --> 00:02:59,360
here because this is a tab and here this
is a tab these are going to stick onto
一半，所以边缘在旁边

108
00:02:59,360 --> 00:02:59,370
is a tab these are going to stick onto
彼此会给你两个

109
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:01,760
is a tab these are going to stick onto
the gable ends and then along the top
45度极点，然后您可以将其

110
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:01,770
the gable ends and then along the top
与中央对齐

111
00:03:01,770 --> 00:03:03,680
the gable ends and then along the top
here yeah you're going to have two tabs
折痕，您可以用它来标记

112
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:03,690
here yeah you're going to have two tabs
你要去哪里

113
00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:06,110
here yeah you're going to have two tabs
here and so you'll need to score this
因为一切都经过测量，您可以

114
00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:06,120
here and so you'll need to score this
实际上将双方都朝下

115
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:10,400
here and so you'll need to score this
line so that those fold down nicely so
同时确保选项卡

116
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:10,410
line so that those fold down nicely so
当它进入时按住它

117
00:03:10,410 --> 00:03:12,470
line so that those fold down nicely so
if you haven't got a set square you can
他们不重叠的位置，所以在此

118
00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:12,480
if you haven't got a set square you can
你可以看到它们有点大，所以我

119
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:15,320
if you haven't got a set square you can
use a corner of a sheet of card this is
只是要剪掉额外的一块

120
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:15,330
use a corner of a sheet of card this is
那些不会在脊柱上重叠

121
00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:17,600
use a corner of a sheet of card this is
a 90 degree angle and so when you come
现在我们可以把它们都压在

122
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:17,610
a 90 degree angle and so when you come
一如既往地用胶水

123
00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:19,790
a 90 degree angle and so when you come
to measuring up you will need the ruler
折痕很重要，所以你

124
00:03:19,790 --> 00:03:19,800
to measuring up you will need the ruler
确保胶水正确

125
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,980
to measuring up you will need the ruler
to measure these distances here but you
折痕，然后可以将其定位

126
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:21,990
to measure these distances here but you
所以那些折痕都在那些

127
00:03:21,990 --> 00:03:24,259
to measure these distances here but you
can then use a the corner of a piece of
准则，然后像所有弹出窗口一样

128
00:03:24,259 --> 00:03:24,269
can then use a the corner of a piece of

00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:26,070
cards just to give you these right
它被牢固地压住了，所以有

131
00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:28,910
cards just to give you these right
angles where the uprights come and here
现在房子的开始

132
00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:28,920
angles where the uprights come and here
拿到屋顶梁，确保所有

133
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:31,640
angles where the uprights come and here
as well so I'll just cut this out really
折痕确实得到很好的加固

134
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:31,650
as well so I'll just cut this out really
前后折叠然后

135
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:33,949
as well so I'll just cut this out really
quickly you can either use a pair of

垂直的，所以您可以将它们都粘在

139
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:39,320
scissors or you can use a craft life
like this so I find craft knives are the
同时，只要确保

140
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:39,330
like this so I find craft knives are the
折痕垂直上升到

141
00:03:39,330 --> 00:03:42,290
like this so I find craft knives are the
the quickest way to go I'll just cut it
山墙末端的最尖端

142
