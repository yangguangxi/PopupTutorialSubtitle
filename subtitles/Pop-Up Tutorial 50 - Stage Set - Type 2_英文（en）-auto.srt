00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:38,260
this tutorial is about this type of card

4
00:00:38,260 --> 00:00:38,270
this tutorial is about this type of card

5
00:00:38,270 --> 00:00:40,840
this tutorial is about this type of card
I call a stage set as you pull the tabs

6
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:40,850
I call a stage set as you pull the tabs

7
00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:42,729
I call a stage set as you pull the tabs
on each side it opens up and you get a

8
00:00:42,729 --> 00:00:42,739
on each side it opens up and you get a

9
00:00:42,739 --> 00:00:45,700
on each side it opens up and you get a
3d Vista so this was one made it's a

10
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:45,710
3d Vista so this was one made it's a

11
00:00:45,710 --> 00:00:48,360
3d Vista so this was one made it's a
birthday card then I've got one here

12
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:48,370
birthday card then I've got one here

13
00:00:48,370 --> 00:00:52,180
birthday card then I've got one here
which was made as a Christmas card pull

14
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:52,190
which was made as a Christmas card pull

15
00:00:52,190 --> 00:00:56,080
which was made as a Christmas card pull
the tabs bit more simple inside and then

16
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:56,090
the tabs bit more simple inside and then

17
00:00:56,090 --> 00:00:59,560
the tabs bit more simple inside and then
I've got one I made myself just checking

18
00:00:59,560 --> 00:00:59,570
I've got one I made myself just checking

19
00:00:59,570 --> 00:01:04,750
I've got one I made myself just checking
how it all works is you pull the tabs

20
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:04,760
how it all works is you pull the tabs

21
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:08,320
how it all works is you pull the tabs
and it opens up its two main pieces one

22
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:08,330
and it opens up its two main pieces one

23
00:01:08,330 --> 00:01:11,560
and it opens up its two main pieces one
is the frame and then the other side is

24
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:11,570
is the frame and then the other side is

25
00:01:11,570 --> 00:01:14,050
is the frame and then the other side is
really one long strip this is the back

26
00:01:14,050 --> 00:01:14,060
really one long strip this is the back

27
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:15,910
really one long strip this is the back
of the scene the two sides and then the

28
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:15,920
of the scene the two sides and then the

29
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:18,609
of the scene the two sides and then the
two bits that you pull the measuring is

30
00:01:18,609 --> 00:01:18,619
two bits that you pull the measuring is

31
00:01:18,619 --> 00:01:21,010
two bits that you pull the measuring is
slightly complicated because the pieces

32
00:01:21,010 --> 00:01:21,020
slightly complicated because the pieces

33
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:23,920
slightly complicated because the pieces
that you pull because they come in like

34
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:23,930
that you pull because they come in like

35
00:01:23,930 --> 00:01:26,859
that you pull because they come in like
this they need to be each of those pulls

36
00:01:26,859 --> 00:01:26,869
this they need to be each of those pulls

37
00:01:26,869 --> 00:01:29,380
this they need to be each of those pulls
pieces has to be half the size of the

38
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:29,390
pieces has to be half the size of the

39
00:01:29,390 --> 00:01:33,789
pieces has to be half the size of the
whole frontage and the two wall bits

40
00:01:33,789 --> 00:01:33,799
whole frontage and the two wall bits

41
00:01:33,799 --> 00:01:37,030
whole frontage and the two wall bits
these bits because they fill in the gap

42
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:37,040
these bits because they fill in the gap

43
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:39,550
these bits because they fill in the gap
they need to be half the size of the gap

44
00:01:39,550 --> 00:01:39,560
they need to be half the size of the gap

45
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:42,940
they need to be half the size of the gap
so I've made all the pieces in advance

46
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:42,950
so I've made all the pieces in advance

47
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:44,679
so I've made all the pieces in advance
with all the measurements marked up on

48
00:01:44,679 --> 00:01:44,689
with all the measurements marked up on

49
00:01:44,689 --> 00:01:47,050
with all the measurements marked up on
it so you can see what they are this is

50
00:01:47,050 --> 00:01:47,060
it so you can see what they are this is

51
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:49,959
it so you can see what they are this is
the main frontage this is half a piece

52
00:01:49,959 --> 00:01:49,969
the main frontage this is half a piece

53
00:01:49,969 --> 00:01:53,830
the main frontage this is half a piece
of a4 card the 21 centimetres across and

54
00:01:53,830 --> 00:01:53,840
of a4 card the 21 centimetres across and

55
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:56,080
of a4 card the 21 centimetres across and
the height is half a sheet of a4 the

56
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:56,090
the height is half a sheet of a4 the

57
00:01:56,090 --> 00:01:58,929
the height is half a sheet of a4 the
important thing is this window so that's

58
00:01:58,929 --> 00:01:58,939
important thing is this window so that's

59
00:01:58,939 --> 00:02:02,370
important thing is this window so that's
ten centimetres by eight centimetres

60
00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:02,380
ten centimetres by eight centimetres

61
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:04,749
ten centimetres by eight centimetres
this is the piece that goes at the back

62
00:02:04,749 --> 00:02:04,759
this is the piece that goes at the back

63
00:02:04,759 --> 00:02:06,399
this is the piece that goes at the back
of the room that you're looking into so

64
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:06,409
of the room that you're looking into so

65
00:02:06,409 --> 00:02:09,160
of the room that you're looking into so
that's 10 by 10 as you can see it's a

66
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:09,170
that's 10 by 10 as you can see it's a

67
00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:11,770
that's 10 by 10 as you can see it's a
little bit it's the same width as the

68
00:02:11,770 --> 00:02:11,780
little bit it's the same width as the

69
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:14,230
little bit it's the same width as the
window but it's a little bit higher than

70
00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:14,240
window but it's a little bit higher than

71
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:14,680
window but it's a little bit higher than
the whole

72
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:14,690
the whole

73
00:02:14,690 --> 00:02:17,770
the whole
window and then these are the two side

74
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:17,780
window and then these are the two side

75
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:20,740
window and then these are the two side
pieces that are going to glue on so if

76
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:20,750
pieces that are going to glue on so if

77
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:23,260
pieces that are going to glue on so if
we look at how this whole long piece the

78
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:23,270
we look at how this whole long piece the

79
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:25,210
we look at how this whole long piece the
two sides the back and the two bits that

80
00:02:25,210 --> 00:02:25,220
two sides the back and the two bits that

81
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:27,580
two sides the back and the two bits that
you pull you'll see that the sides have

82
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:27,590
you pull you'll see that the sides have

83
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:30,700
you pull you'll see that the sides have
these slots cut in them and then the

84
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:30,710
these slots cut in them and then the

85
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:34,000
these slots cut in them and then the
images are on bars that go through the

86
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:34,010
images are on bars that go through the

87
00:02:34,010 --> 00:02:36,760
images are on bars that go through the
slots here's a couple of bars that I've

88
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:36,770
slots here's a couple of bars that I've

89
00:02:36,770 --> 00:02:40,630
slots here's a couple of bars that I've
cut out these are the sides that will

90
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:40,640
cut out these are the sides that will

91
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:43,090
cut out these are the sides that will
stick on to the the back of the room so

92
00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:43,100
stick on to the the back of the room so

93
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:45,640
stick on to the the back of the room so
this will be the back of the room these

94
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:45,650
this will be the back of the room these

95
00:02:45,650 --> 00:02:48,130
this will be the back of the room these
are going to stick on like this so these

96
00:02:48,130 --> 00:02:48,140
are going to stick on like this so these

97
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:51,820
are going to stick on like this so these
are the measurements the whole piece is

98
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:51,830
are the measurements the whole piece is

99
00:02:51,830 --> 00:02:55,540
are the measurements the whole piece is
21 across so each of these has to be ten

100
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:55,550
21 across so each of these has to be ten

101
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:58,750
21 across so each of these has to be ten
and a half and then the width of the

102
00:02:58,750 --> 00:02:58,760
and a half and then the width of the

103
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:02,920
and a half and then the width of the
window is ten so these have to be half

104
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:02,930
window is ten so these have to be half

105
00:03:02,930 --> 00:03:05,740
window is ten so these have to be half
of that so these are five so when it's

106
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:05,750
of that so these are five so when it's

107
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:08,740
of that so these are five so when it's
in position it'll be like that and then

108
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:08,750
in position it'll be like that and then

109
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:10,630
in position it'll be like that and then
it has these slots that the bars go

110
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:10,640
it has these slots that the bars go

111
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:13,900
it has these slots that the bars go
through the one nearest the front of the

112
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:13,910
through the one nearest the front of the

113
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:16,120
through the one nearest the front of the
window that'll be one and a half

114
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:16,130
window that'll be one and a half

115
00:03:16,130 --> 00:03:19,240
window that'll be one and a half
centimeters high from the bottom and the

116
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:19,250
centimeters high from the bottom and the

117
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:20,800
centimeters high from the bottom and the
one behind it will be two and a half

118
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:20,810
one behind it will be two and a half

119
00:03:20,810 --> 00:03:22,930
one behind it will be two and a half
centimeters high they're both two

120
00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:22,940
centimeters high they're both two

121
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:26,380
centimeters high they're both two
centimeters deep and they're one and a

122
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:26,390
centimeters deep and they're one and a

123
00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:29,710
centimeters deep and they're one and a
half centimeters in from the edges so

124
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:29,720
half centimeters in from the edges so

125
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:31,750
half centimeters in from the edges so
there are two of these pieces they go

126
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:31,760
there are two of these pieces they go

127
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:35,380
there are two of these pieces they go
one on each side of the back so now I'll

128
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:35,390
one on each side of the back so now I'll

129
00:03:35,390 --> 00:03:37,780
one on each side of the back so now I'll
just stick these together I'll keep the

130
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:37,790
just stick these together I'll keep the

131
00:03:37,790 --> 00:03:40,630
just stick these together I'll keep the
measurements out of you so when you open

132
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:40,640
measurements out of you so when you open

133
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:43,150
measurements out of you so when you open
the whole cards you won't see all the

134
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:43,160
the whole cards you won't see all the

135
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:45,550
the whole cards you won't see all the
measurements I've got that one room so

136
00:03:45,550 --> 00:03:45,560
measurements I've got that one room so

137
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:48,759
measurements I've got that one room so
it's gonna be like that so I'll stick

138
00:03:48,759 --> 00:03:48,769
it's gonna be like that so I'll stick

139
00:03:48,769 --> 00:03:51,280
it's gonna be like that so I'll stick
these together let's put some glue on

140
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:51,290
these together let's put some glue on

141
00:03:51,290 --> 00:03:57,280
these together let's put some glue on
this tab here I've already pre scored it

142
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:57,290
this tab here I've already pre scored it

143
00:03:57,290 --> 00:04:00,640
this tab here I've already pre scored it
and folded it and creased it so it's all

144
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:00,650
and folded it and creased it so it's all

145
00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:02,199
and folded it and creased it so it's all
going to move nicely but when you're

146
00:04:02,199 --> 00:04:02,209
going to move nicely but when you're

147
00:04:02,209 --> 00:04:04,449
going to move nicely but when you're
actually making your own don't forget to

148
00:04:04,449 --> 00:04:04,459
actually making your own don't forget to

149
00:04:04,459 --> 00:04:06,580
actually making your own don't forget to
really crimp all the creases so they

150
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:06,590
really crimp all the creases so they

151
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:10,470
really crimp all the creases so they
they move really well so that's gonna go

152
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:10,480
they move really well so that's gonna go

153
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:15,759
they move really well so that's gonna go
like that right so stuck one side on and

154
00:04:15,759 --> 00:04:15,769
like that right so stuck one side on and

155
00:04:15,769 --> 00:04:19,870
like that right so stuck one side on and
now I'm going to stick the other side on

156
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:19,880
now I'm going to stick the other side on

157
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:21,970
now I'm going to stick the other side on
to the other side to make this really

158
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:21,980
to the other side to make this really

159
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:25,500
to the other side to make this really
long strip so to put there

160
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:25,510
long strip so to put there

161
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:28,380
long strip so to put there
the tabs go behind the back of the room

162
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:28,390
the tabs go behind the back of the room

163
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:36,830
the tabs go behind the back of the room
as I call it and put the glue on here

164
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:36,840


165
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:39,690
smooth it when you're gluing always

166
00:04:39,690 --> 00:04:39,700
smooth it when you're gluing always

167
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:43,410
smooth it when you're gluing always
smear the glue right up to the crease so

168
00:04:43,410 --> 00:04:43,420
smear the glue right up to the crease so

169
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:44,550
smear the glue right up to the crease so
there it is

170
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:44,560
there it is

171
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:49,530
there it is
well that round to make it go smoothly

172
00:04:49,530 --> 00:04:49,540
well that round to make it go smoothly

173
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:53,400
well that round to make it go smoothly
so that's how the main long piece looks

174
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:53,410
so that's how the main long piece looks

175
00:04:53,410 --> 00:04:57,600
so that's how the main long piece looks
so when it closes down it'll close like

176
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:57,610
so when it closes down it'll close like

177
00:04:57,610 --> 00:05:00,510
so when it closes down it'll close like
this so now we have to add it to the

178
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:00,520
this so now we have to add it to the

179
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:05,300
this so now we have to add it to the
frame for that we have these two sleeves

180
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:05,310
frame for that we have these two sleeves

181
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:08,460
frame for that we have these two sleeves
so we've got these two sleeves they're

182
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:08,470
so we've got these two sleeves they're

183
00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:13,050
so we've got these two sleeves they're
the pieces that go at the back you can

184
00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:13,060
the pieces that go at the back you can

185
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:14,880
the pieces that go at the back you can
see I haven't got them colored but

186
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:14,890
see I haven't got them colored but

187
00:05:14,890 --> 00:05:17,400
see I haven't got them colored but
there's a sleeve here and a sleeve here

188
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:17,410
there's a sleeve here and a sleeve here

189
00:05:17,410 --> 00:05:19,710
there's a sleeve here and a sleeve here
they're the ones that hold these sliding

190
00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:19,720
they're the ones that hold these sliding

191
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:22,860
they're the ones that hold these sliding
pieces in place and make them move the

192
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:22,870
pieces in place and make them move the

193
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:24,780
pieces in place and make them move the
way you want them to move so I've got

194
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:24,790
way you want them to move so I've got

195
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:28,100
way you want them to move so I've got
two of those they're just a fraction

196
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:28,110
two of those they're just a fraction

197
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:30,360
two of those they're just a fraction
longer than the whole height of the

198
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:30,370
longer than the whole height of the

199
00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:33,570
longer than the whole height of the
sliding piece so they are ten point five

200
00:05:33,570 --> 00:05:33,580
sliding piece so they are ten point five

201
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:36,990
sliding piece so they are ten point five
centimeters and they're going to glue on

202
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:37,000
centimeters and they're going to glue on

203
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,360
centimeters and they're going to glue on
the back of this so I've got the

204
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:39,370
the back of this so I've got the

205
00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:40,800
the back of this so I've got the
measurements here but I'll keep the

206
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:40,810
measurements here but I'll keep the

207
00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:42,990
measurements here but I'll keep the
measurements on the back I'm going to

208
00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:43,000
measurements on the back I'm going to

209
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,580
measurements on the back I'm going to
stick these on this they go right up

210
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:46,590
stick these on this they go right up

211
00:05:46,590 --> 00:05:50,310
stick these on this they go right up
flush against the window I put glue on

212
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:50,320
flush against the window I put glue on

213
00:05:50,320 --> 00:06:05,700
flush against the window I put glue on
the two tabs 1 2and these go like this

214
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:05,710
the two tabs 1 2and these go like this

215
00:06:05,710 --> 00:06:09,270
the two tabs 1 2and these go like this
ideally I would have measured it so that

216
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:09,280
ideally I would have measured it so that

217
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:14,100
ideally I would have measured it so that
they're exactly equidistant above and

218
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:14,110
they're exactly equidistant above and

219
00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:18,300
they're exactly equidistant above and
below the window frame so there's one is

220
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:18,310
below the window frame so there's one is

221
00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:21,240
below the window frame so there's one is
the other one and just make sure that's

222
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:21,250
the other one and just make sure that's

223
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:24,570
the other one and just make sure that's
creased well as well but glue on those

224
00:06:24,570 --> 00:06:24,580
creased well as well but glue on those

225
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:30,650
creased well as well but glue on those
two

226
00:06:30,650 --> 00:06:30,660


227
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:32,180
then be careful with this gluing you

228
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:32,190
then be careful with this gluing you

229
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:35,210
then be careful with this gluing you
really don't want it losing too much and

230
00:06:35,210 --> 00:06:35,220
really don't want it losing too much and

231
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:44,180
really don't want it losing too much and
gluing the sleeve closed that's it so

232
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:44,190
gluing the sleeve closed that's it so

233
00:06:44,190 --> 00:06:47,240
gluing the sleeve closed that's it so
there's the two sleeves flush up against

234
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:47,250
there's the two sleeves flush up against

235
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:50,330
there's the two sleeves flush up against
the edges of the the window now we take

236
00:06:50,330 --> 00:06:50,340
the edges of the the window now we take

237
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:55,070
the edges of the the window now we take
this piece and thread it all through so

238
00:06:55,070 --> 00:06:55,080
this piece and thread it all through so

239
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:59,290
this piece and thread it all through so
it's going to go like this so put one

240
00:06:59,290 --> 00:06:59,300
it's going to go like this so put one

241
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:04,760
it's going to go like this so put one
side through there and the other side

242
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:04,770
side through there and the other side

243
00:07:04,770 --> 00:07:13,160
side through there and the other side
through there so now you can see as it

244
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:13,170
through there so now you can see as it

245
00:07:13,170 --> 00:07:19,250
through there so now you can see as it
closes these will come in looks as

246
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:19,260
closes these will come in looks as

247
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:20,930
closes these will come in looks as
though my measuring is ever so slightly

248
00:07:20,930 --> 00:07:20,940
though my measuring is ever so slightly

249
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:23,330
though my measuring is ever so slightly
off because there's a this still a bit

250
00:07:23,330 --> 00:07:23,340
off because there's a this still a bit

251
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:25,970
off because there's a this still a bit
of a gap and then when you pull it it

252
00:07:25,970 --> 00:07:25,980
of a gap and then when you pull it it

253
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:29,830
of a gap and then when you pull it it
opens up now we put these bars in place

254
00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:29,840
opens up now we put these bars in place

255
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:32,510
opens up now we put these bars in place
so the length of the bars a ten point

256
00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:32,520
so the length of the bars a ten point

257
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:35,060
so the length of the bars a ten point
two which is just slightly longer than

258
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:35,070
two which is just slightly longer than

259
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:38,000
two which is just slightly longer than
the width of the window and the height

260
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:38,010
the width of the window and the height

261
00:07:38,010 --> 00:07:40,970
the width of the window and the height
of the bars is one point seven which is

262
00:07:40,970 --> 00:07:40,980
of the bars is one point seven which is

263
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:43,430
of the bars is one point seven which is
just slightly less than the height of

264
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:43,440
just slightly less than the height of

265
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:46,220
just slightly less than the height of
the slots and each bar has these two

266
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:46,230
the slots and each bar has these two

267
00:07:46,230 --> 00:07:48,650
the slots and each bar has these two
tabs on each end these you just fold

268
00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:48,660
tabs on each end these you just fold

269
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:50,630
tabs on each end these you just fold
them down you don't crease them and

270
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:50,640
them down you don't crease them and

271
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:52,670
them down you don't crease them and
score them you just fold them down so

272
00:07:52,670 --> 00:07:52,680
score them you just fold them down so

273
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:55,040
score them you just fold them down so
they'll feed through their slot so I'll

274
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:55,050
they'll feed through their slot so I'll

275
00:07:55,050 --> 00:07:59,780
they'll feed through their slot so I'll
just fold these down like this and feed

276
00:07:59,780 --> 00:07:59,790
just fold these down like this and feed

277
00:07:59,790 --> 00:08:06,290
just fold these down like this and feed
them through the slot oh yeah

278
00:08:06,290 --> 00:08:06,300
them through the slot oh yeah

279
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:08,530
them through the slot oh yeah
once it's through the slot you can

280
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:08,540
once it's through the slot you can

281
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:11,660
once it's through the slot you can
straighten out the tabs again and on the

282
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:11,670
straighten out the tabs again and on the

283
00:08:11,670 --> 00:08:21,910
straighten out the tabs again and on the
other side fiddly

284
00:08:21,910 --> 00:08:21,920


285
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:26,570
right there we go there's the fat bar

286
00:08:26,570 --> 00:08:26,580
right there we go there's the fat bar

287
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:29,060
right there we go there's the fat bar
fitted in I've made a slight mistake

288
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:29,070
fitted in I've made a slight mistake

289
00:08:29,070 --> 00:08:31,070
fitted in I've made a slight mistake
there I put it in with the numbers

290
00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:31,080
there I put it in with the numbers

291
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:34,460
there I put it in with the numbers
showing but not to worry then here's the

292
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:34,470
showing but not to worry then here's the

293
00:08:34,470 --> 00:08:57,860
showing but not to worry then here's the
other one right so now you can see the

294
00:08:57,860 --> 00:08:57,870
other one right so now you can see the

295
00:08:57,870 --> 00:09:00,350
other one right so now you can see the
two bars are in place like that now we

296
00:09:00,350 --> 00:09:00,360
two bars are in place like that now we

297
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:03,260
two bars are in place like that now we
can add the images and stick them onto

298
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:03,270
can add the images and stick them onto

299
00:09:03,270 --> 00:09:05,990
can add the images and stick them onto
them as it closes if you look that way

300
00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:06,000
them as it closes if you look that way

301
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,110
them as it closes if you look that way
you'll see that the slots get closer and

302
00:09:09,110 --> 00:09:09,120
you'll see that the slots get closer and

303
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:12,200
you'll see that the slots get closer and
closer together and so the closer the

304
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:12,210
closer together and so the closer the

305
00:09:12,210 --> 00:09:15,320
closer together and so the closer the
bar is to the front of the stage the

306
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:15,330
bar is to the front of the stage the

307
00:09:15,330 --> 00:09:18,530
bar is to the front of the stage the
smaller the image has to be this is the

308
00:09:18,530 --> 00:09:18,540
smaller the image has to be this is the

309
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:21,020
smaller the image has to be this is the
front image it has to be not more than 3

310
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:21,030
front image it has to be not more than 3

311
00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:22,250
front image it has to be not more than 3
centimeters wide

312
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:22,260
centimeters wide

313
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:24,950
centimeters wide
so I'll just glue that into place of

314
00:09:24,950 --> 00:09:24,960
so I'll just glue that into place of

315
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:28,040
so I'll just glue that into place of
glue it with the blank side showing

316
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:28,050
glue it with the blank side showing

317
00:09:28,050 --> 00:09:30,320
glue it with the blank side showing
because that's slightly more aesthetic

318
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:30,330
because that's slightly more aesthetic

319
00:09:30,330 --> 00:09:33,620
because that's slightly more aesthetic
want the glue on the back so the image

320
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:33,630
want the glue on the back so the image

321
00:09:33,630 --> 00:09:37,720
want the glue on the back so the image
is just standing there rather than

322
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:37,730
is just standing there rather than

323
00:09:37,730 --> 00:09:42,140
is just standing there rather than
behind the bar you can actually glue it

324
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:42,150
behind the bar you can actually glue it

325
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:49,820
behind the bar you can actually glue it
to any point on the bar and as it all

326
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:49,830
to any point on the bar and as it all

327
00:09:49,830 --> 00:09:52,640
to any point on the bar and as it all
closes the bars will slide around at the

328
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:52,650
closes the bars will slide around at the

329
00:09:52,650 --> 00:09:54,410
closes the bars will slide around at the
back so they find their own place

330
00:09:54,410 --> 00:09:54,420
back so they find their own place

331
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:58,070
back so they find their own place
so if you look at it end on you'll see

332
00:09:58,070 --> 00:09:58,080
so if you look at it end on you'll see

333
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:00,680
so if you look at it end on you'll see
how the two slots as it closes they'll

334
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:00,690
how the two slots as it closes they'll

335
00:10:00,690 --> 00:10:02,510
how the two slots as it closes they'll
come closer and closer together and

336
00:10:02,510 --> 00:10:02,520
come closer and closer together and

337
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:05,210
come closer and closer together and
that's why it can't be more than three

338
00:10:05,210 --> 00:10:05,220
that's why it can't be more than three

339
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:07,670
that's why it can't be more than three
centimeters wide known as you pull it

340
00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:07,680
centimeters wide known as you pull it

341
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:12,230
centimeters wide known as you pull it
open there it is now I'll put on the

342
00:10:12,230 --> 00:10:12,240
open there it is now I'll put on the

343
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,240
open there it is now I'll put on the
second image this is going on the back

344
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:14,250
second image this is going on the back

345
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:16,340
second image this is going on the back
bar this is not more than seven

346
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:16,350
bar this is not more than seven

347
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:19,010
bar this is not more than seven
centimeters wide let's now put some glue

348
00:10:19,010 --> 00:10:19,020
centimeters wide let's now put some glue

349
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:28,970
centimeters wide let's now put some glue
on that one and that can go down there

350
00:10:28,970 --> 00:10:28,980


351
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:34,010
just close it up and press it all down

352
00:10:34,010 --> 00:10:34,020


353
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:36,329
so that's the whole thing now there's

354
00:10:36,329 --> 00:10:36,339
so that's the whole thing now there's

355
00:10:36,339 --> 00:10:38,490
so that's the whole thing now there's
one other thing you might feel the

356
00:10:38,490 --> 00:10:38,500
one other thing you might feel the

357
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:41,490
one other thing you might feel the
slides on the side they can actually go

358
00:10:41,490 --> 00:10:41,500
slides on the side they can actually go

359
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:44,190
slides on the side they can actually go
in too far which makes it a bit a bit

360
00:10:44,190 --> 00:10:44,200
in too far which makes it a bit a bit

361
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:47,370
in too far which makes it a bit a bit
tricky so you can just put a bit of card

362
00:10:47,370 --> 00:10:47,380
tricky so you can just put a bit of card

363
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:50,970
tricky so you can just put a bit of card
down each side that will just act as a

364
00:10:50,970 --> 00:10:50,980
down each side that will just act as a

365
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:52,920
down each side that will just act as a
governor and just stop it pushing in too

366
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:52,930
governor and just stop it pushing in too

367
00:10:52,930 --> 00:10:55,769
governor and just stop it pushing in too
far so I'll just cut a quick piece of

368
00:10:55,769 --> 00:10:55,779
far so I'll just cut a quick piece of

369
00:10:55,779 --> 00:11:04,280
far so I'll just cut a quick piece of
this to do that with and this should be

370
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:04,290
this to do that with and this should be

371
00:11:04,290 --> 00:11:06,630
this to do that with and this should be
half of this should be long enough I

372
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:06,640
half of this should be long enough I

373
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:23,760
half of this should be long enough I
think so these need to be ever so

374
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:23,770
think so these need to be ever so

375
00:11:23,770 --> 00:11:27,360
think so these need to be ever so
slightly longer than the width of these

376
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:27,370
slightly longer than the width of these

377
00:11:27,370 --> 00:11:31,370
slightly longer than the width of these
sliding pieces so it goes on like that

378
00:11:31,370 --> 00:11:31,380
sliding pieces so it goes on like that

379
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:40,170
sliding pieces so it goes on like that
cut it off there so you get the sliding

380
00:11:40,170 --> 00:11:40,180
cut it off there so you get the sliding

381
00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:45,780
cut it off there so you get the sliding
piece into its fully closed position and

382
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:45,790
piece into its fully closed position and

383
00:11:45,790 --> 00:11:49,560
piece into its fully closed position and
then put some glue on the on the actual

384
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:49,570
then put some glue on the on the actual

385
00:11:49,570 --> 00:11:54,870
then put some glue on the on the actual
sliding piece I'll position the slides

386
00:11:54,870 --> 00:11:54,880
sliding piece I'll position the slides

387
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:58,079
sliding piece I'll position the slides
at the most in that you want it to be so

388
00:11:58,079 --> 00:11:58,089
at the most in that you want it to be so

389
00:11:58,089 --> 00:12:00,630
at the most in that you want it to be so
there it is the edge of the slide is

390
00:12:00,630 --> 00:12:00,640
there it is the edge of the slide is

391
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:02,790
there it is the edge of the slide is
flush with the edge of the frame and

392
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:02,800
flush with the edge of the frame and

393
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:06,390
flush with the edge of the frame and
then we'll stick this piece across it up

394
00:12:06,390 --> 00:12:06,400
then we'll stick this piece across it up

395
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:09,210
then we'll stick this piece across it up
against the sleeve so it won't slide in

396
00:12:09,210 --> 00:12:09,220
against the sleeve so it won't slide in

397
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:12,090
against the sleeve so it won't slide in
any further when it's pushed and I'll

398
00:12:12,090 --> 00:12:12,100
any further when it's pushed and I'll

399
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:16,500
any further when it's pushed and I'll
just tidy that there so that's that side

400
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:16,510
just tidy that there so that's that side

401
00:12:16,510 --> 00:12:21,360
just tidy that there so that's that side
so that can and I'll do the same on the

402
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:21,370
so that can and I'll do the same on the

403
00:12:21,370 --> 00:12:24,690
so that can and I'll do the same on the
other side but the slide so it's flush

404
00:12:24,690 --> 00:12:24,700
other side but the slide so it's flush

405
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:27,090
other side but the slide so it's flush
with the edge of the frame but a little

406
00:12:27,090 --> 00:12:27,100
with the edge of the frame but a little

407
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:31,019
with the edge of the frame but a little
bit of glue on here and then stick the

408
00:12:31,019 --> 00:12:31,029
bit of glue on here and then stick the

409
00:12:31,029 --> 00:12:34,079
bit of glue on here and then stick the
governing piece again I haven't cut it

410
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:34,089
governing piece again I haven't cut it

411
00:12:34,089 --> 00:12:40,680
governing piece again I haven't cut it
to size beforehand

412
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:40,690


413
00:12:40,690 --> 00:12:44,590
get the sliding piece in position and

414
00:12:44,590 --> 00:12:44,600
get the sliding piece in position and

415
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:48,940
get the sliding piece in position and
stick this governing piece across just

416
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:48,950
stick this governing piece across just

417
00:12:48,950 --> 00:12:56,410
stick this governing piece across just
stop it going in any further so there we

418
00:12:56,410 --> 00:12:56,420
stop it going in any further so there we

419
00:12:56,420 --> 00:12:59,140
stop it going in any further so there we
are now you can see it's like this

420
00:12:59,140 --> 00:12:59,150
are now you can see it's like this

421
00:12:59,150 --> 00:13:02,530
are now you can see it's like this
maybe these extra pieces are looking a

422
00:13:02,530 --> 00:13:02,540
maybe these extra pieces are looking a

423
00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:04,270
maybe these extra pieces are looking a
little bit clunky so you could actually

424
00:13:04,270 --> 00:13:04,280
little bit clunky so you could actually

425
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:06,880
little bit clunky so you could actually
just trim them right down they only need

426
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:06,890
just trim them right down they only need

427
00:13:06,890 --> 00:13:09,850
just trim them right down they only need
to be about half a centimeter longer

428
00:13:09,850 --> 00:13:09,860
to be about half a centimeter longer

429
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:13,480
to be about half a centimeter longer
than the actual sliding piece just

430
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:13,490
than the actual sliding piece just

431
00:13:13,490 --> 00:13:15,850
than the actual sliding piece just
enough to come up against the sleeve and

432
00:13:15,850 --> 00:13:15,860
enough to come up against the sleeve and

433
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:18,040
enough to come up against the sleeve and
stop it going in too fast so I'll cut

434
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:18,050
stop it going in too fast so I'll cut

435
00:13:18,050 --> 00:13:29,050
stop it going in too fast so I'll cut
both of those back a bit oh yeah so

436
00:13:29,050 --> 00:13:29,060
both of those back a bit oh yeah so

437
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:33,010
both of those back a bit oh yeah so
that's it the opening stage set if it

438
00:13:33,010 --> 00:13:33,020
that's it the opening stage set if it

439
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:36,490
that's it the opening stage set if it
was kept flat for longer with a book on

440
00:13:36,490 --> 00:13:36,500
was kept flat for longer with a book on

441
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:38,080
was kept flat for longer with a book on
top of it or something all the creases

442
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:38,090
top of it or something all the creases

443
00:13:38,090 --> 00:13:39,730
top of it or something all the creases
would reinforce and it would tend to

444
00:13:39,730 --> 00:13:39,740
would reinforce and it would tend to

445
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:42,210
would reinforce and it would tend to
hold itself shut the way this one does

446
00:13:42,210 --> 00:13:42,220
hold itself shut the way this one does

447
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:46,840
hold itself shut the way this one does
so that's it quite a fun card the stage

448
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:46,850
so that's it quite a fun card the stage

449
00:13:46,850 --> 00:13:48,490
so that's it quite a fun card the stage
set type to

450
00:13:48,490 --> 00:13:48,500
set type to

00:13:48,500 --> 00:14:05,419
set type to
