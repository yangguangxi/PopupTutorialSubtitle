00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:52,089
if you look at it this way you can see
两个外边缘

13
00:00:52,089 --> 00:00:55,319
if you look at it this way you can see
it's actually 2 parallelograms centered
这就是将整块东西锁住的原因

14
00:00:55,319 --> 00:00:55,329
it's actually 2 parallelograms centered
形状用于无尽的雕塑

15
00:00:55,329 --> 00:00:58,439
it's actually 2 parallelograms centered

00:01:08,819 --> 00:01:08,829
and then you have this piece that joins
整件到位这是一个

23
00:01:08,829 --> 00:01:10,139
and then you have this piece that joins
the two outer edges
稍微花哨一点，这又是

24
00:01:10,139 --> 00:01:10,149
the two outer edges
这是基本的盒子，如果你看的话

25
00:01:10,149 --> 00:01:11,700
the two outer edges
that's what locks the whole piece into
最后，您可以看到有一个支柱

26
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:11,710
that's what locks the whole piece into
粘在推上盖子的脊柱上

27

00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:29,770
see here's the pillow that pushes up the
粘贴标签就可以了

39
00:01:29,770 --> 00:01:32,340
see here's the pillow that pushes up the
lid this is the lid and then these
三遍，所以你得到一二三

40
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:32,350
lid this is the lid and then these
想要脱衣舞娘，所以我们只是做一个

41
00:01:32,350 --> 00:01:34,560
lid this is the lid and then these
curved shapes these are what lock the
非常简单的小盒子，所以这些是

42
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:34,570
curved shapes these are what lock the
将被削减而不是得分

43
00:01:34,570 --> 00:01:38,219
curved shapes these are what lock the
whole piece into position this is a
线

44
00:01:38,219 --> 00:01:38,229
whole piece into position this is a
所以我们就把它画在那里

45
00:01:38,229 --> 00:01:43,260
whole piece into position this is a
slightly more fancy one this is again
一个在那里一个在这里，另外两个在这里

46
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:43,270
slightly more fancy one this is again
不会这么早就一直上升

47
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:46,080
slightly more fancy one this is again
this is the basic box if you look at it
当你把它剪下来的时候

48
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:46,090
this is the basic box if you look at it
用工艺刀代替剪刀

49
00:01:46,090 --> 00:01:48,020
this is the basic box if you look at it
end on you can see there is a pillar
这只是为了提高速度，但您可以使用

50
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:48,030
end on you can see there is a pillar
你可以使用任何一个，所以就切

51
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:51,300
end on you can see there is a pillar
glue to the spine that pushes up the lid
这些行，所以您要制作四个

52
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:51,310
glue to the spine that pushes up the lid
你可能想削减的条

53
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:53,999
glue to the spine that pushes up the lid
the bonnet and the roof and pushes those
金属尺子，但我通常只是这样做

54
00:01:53,999 --> 00:01:54,009
the bonnet and the roof and pushes those
眼睛，然后修剪这些

55
00:01:54,009 --> 00:01:56,489
the bonnet and the roof and pushes those
up that it's the lids that push out the
所以两个像这样，两个像这样

56
00:01:56,489 --> 00:01:56,499
up that it's the lids that push out the
我们有两个短的

57
00:01:56,499 --> 00:01:58,859
up that it's the lids that push out the
sides of the top of the structure and
两个正方形，每个末端都有一个标签

58
00:01:58,859 --> 00:01:58,869
sides of the top of the structure and
你有两个长的三个

59
00:01:58,869 --> 00:02:01,020
sides of the top of the structure and
then you know here's the and the two
标签两端的正方形，我们将

60
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:01,030
then you know here's the and the two
折叠所有那些折叠线

61
00:02:01,030 --> 00:02:02,700
then you know here's the and the two
ends that lock the whole thing into
所以这是您的底片

62
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:02,710
ends that lock the whole thing into
卡完全折痕，然后您

63
00:02:02,710 --> 00:02:07,230
ends that lock the whole thing into
shape
有你的四个步骤

64


将要使盒子，所以你有

65
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:11,260
you will need a ruler as well as a biro
两个长的两个短的，所以拿一个

66
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:11,270
you will need a ruler as well as a biro
这些长胶条中的一端胶水

67
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:13,479
you will need a ruler as well as a biro
or something like that to score with and
你胶水，你这一端冲洗胶水

68
00:02:13,479 --> 00:02:13,489
or something like that to score with and
与脊椎，所以就像那样

69
00:02:13,489 --> 00:02:16,660
or something like that to score with and
glue and scissors so start with a scored
你只要折叠一下就可以了

70
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:16,670
glue and scissors so start with a scored
那里真的很舒服

71
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:18,490
glue and scissors so start with a scored
line this is going to go right across
那就是你现在将其折叠成一个

72
00:02:18,490 --> 00:02:18,500
line this is going to go right across
平仓

73
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:20,229
line this is going to go right across
the paper this is going to be your
把胶水粘到最上面

74
00:02:20,229 --> 00:02:20,239
the paper this is going to be your
折痕很重要

75
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:24,900
the paper this is going to be your
glueing tabs just go right across do it
关上花瓶，把它打开

76
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:24,910
glueing tabs just go right across do it
得到了一个平行四边形

77
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:43,120
glueing tabs just go right across do it
three times so you got one two three you
教程5现在您构建相同的东西

78
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:43,130
three times so you got one two three you
在脊椎的另一边，所以你

79
00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:46,150
three times so you got one two three you
want strips so we're just making a
带上其他三个面板条

80
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:46,160
want strips so we're just making a
一端胶水再次与

81
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:49,059
want strips so we're just making a
really simple small box so these are
脊柱减慢速度然后粘上

82
00:02:49,059 --> 00:02:49,069
really simple small box so these are
该条的另一端放入

83
00:02:49,069 --> 00:02:50,920
really simple small box so these are
going to be cut lines rather than score
它的关闭位置关闭了底座

84
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:50,930
going to be cut lines rather than score
现在你有两个平行四边形

85
00:02:50,930 --> 00:02:51,430
going to be cut lines rather than score
lines
支持这仍然是不稳定的

86
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:51,440
lines
此时的结构，如果您要

87
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:54,250
lines
so we'll just draw it in there there's
想要从中冒出来的东西

88
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:54,260
so we'll just draw it in there there's
中间，如果你想要像

89
00:02:54,260 --> 00:03:03,840
so we'll just draw it in there there's
one there one here and two more in here

从盒子中间伸出来

91
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:09,910
that don't go all the way up so early so
现在是您放进去的机会，如果您

92
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:09,920
that don't go all the way up so early so
想要现在就坚持下去，否则现在

93
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,289
that don't go all the way up so early so
when you cut it out I'm just going to
将胶水放在中间的表面上

94
00:03:11,289 --> 00:03:11,299
when you cut it out I'm just going to
在这里并将这两个背靠背粘在一起

95
00:03:11,299 --> 00:03:13,030
when you cut it out I'm just going to
use a craft knife rather than scissors
这个中心支柱需要很多

96
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:13,040
use a craft knife rather than scissors
压力，所以最好加倍

97
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,949
use a craft knife rather than scissors
and it's just for speed but you can use
厚度卡是否可以向上推

98
00:03:14,949 --> 00:03:14,959
and it's just for speed but you can use
顶部很容易不屈曲

99
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:17,949
and it's just for speed but you can use
you can use either so just cut along
这仍然是一个不稳定的结构

100
00:03:17,949 --> 00:03:17,959
you can use either so just cut along
只是平行四边形，你可以

101
00:03:17,959 --> 00:03:21,430
you can use either so just cut along
these these lines so you're making four
看到它只是在这附近摇摆

102
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:21,440
these these lines so you're making four
其实很早的基础

103
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:27,940
these these lines so you're making four
strips you might want to cut against the
维多利亚时代的弹出窗口只是

104
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:27,950
strips you might want to cut against the
用这样的平行四边形制成

105
00:03:27,950 --> 00:03:33,910

metal ruler but I usually just do it by
在页面上方为您提供了浮动平面

106
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:33,920
metal ruler but I usually just do it by
但是他们无法稳定

107
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:36,849
metal ruler but I usually just do it by
eye and then trim these up
摇摆仍然是3d，但不是

108
00:03:36,849 --> 00:03:36,859
eye and then trim these up
刚性结构，那么您可以选择其中之一

109
00:03:36,859 --> 00:03:48,340
eye and then trim these up
so two like that and two like this here
这两个面板和这些棍子

110
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:48,350
so two like that and two like this here
跨越他们附着到平原

111
00:03:48,350 --> 00:03:50,770
so two like that and two like this here
we are got two short ones which are just
而且选项卡去的地方真的没有

112
00:03:50,770 --> 00:03:50,780
we are got two short ones which are just
重要的是您的设计问题

113
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:52,780
we are got two short ones which are just
two squares with a tab on each end and
他们可以进入室内或室外

114
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:52,790
two squares with a tab on each end and
是的，我只是要在

115
00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:55,990
two squares with a tab on each end and
you have two long ones that are three
外面只是为了简单

116
00:03:55,990 --> 00:03:56,000
you have two long ones that are three
您可以将胶水放在两个标签上

117
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,670
you have two long ones that are three
squares of the tab on each end and we'll
同时用胶水将它们粘上

118
00:03:57,670 --> 00:03:57,680
squares of the tab on each end and we'll
只是为了让它变得有趣而已

119
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:09,440
squares of the tab on each end and we'll
just fold all those those fold lines
这是一个刚性结构，您不需要

120


仅在另一端需要面板时

121
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:12,479
so here's your base sheet a single piece
你真的想做一个坚实的

122
00:04:12,479 --> 00:04:12,489
so here's your base sheet a single piece
盒子也不必是完整的

123
00:04:12,489 --> 00:04:16,710
so here's your base sheet a single piece
of card thoroughly creased and then you

124
00:04:16,710 --> 00:04:16,720
of card thoroughly creased and then you
然后将两个外平面连接起来

125
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:19,949
of card thoroughly creased and then you
have your your four step of strips that
它将起作用之间的区别

126
00:04:19,949 --> 00:04:19,959
have your your four step of strips that
这些和水上飞机类型

two long ones two short ones so take one
它将阻止您拥有任何东西

131
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:30,770
two long ones two short ones so take one
of these long ones put glue on one end
向前伸出，你可以有碎片

132
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:30,780
of these long ones put glue on one end
以这种方式喷射出来的

133
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:34,469
of these long ones put glue on one end
you glue you glue this one end flush
方式，但在这种情况下，他们不能只是出去

134
00:04:34,469 --> 00:04:34,479
you glue you glue this one end flush
直接从顶部

135
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:40,040
you glue you glue this one end flush
with the spine so it's like that then
所以现在我将向您展示一个整体

00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:28,880
need the panel on the other end only if
当页面关闭时，这些即将到来

241
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,310
need the panel on the other end only if
you're really wanting to make a solid

00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:32,950
you're really wanting to make a solid
box also it doesn't need to be the full
整个事情成型，接下来我们有

244
00:07:32,950 --> 00:07:32,960
box also it doesn't need to be the full
威利bollocks

非同寻常的雕塑集

247
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:39,400
height of the of the box yeah as long as
it's joining the two outer planes then
这是我要告诉你的那个

248
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:39,410
it's joining the two outer planes then
大型卡车超越了

249
00:07:39,410 --> 00:07:41,800
it's joining the two outer planes then
it will work the difference between
本教程真的

250
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:41,810
it will work the difference between
非凡的内置拉力条

251
00:07:41,810 --> 00:07:44,290
it will work the difference between
these and the floating plane type
当您拉带子陷阱

252
00:07:44,290 --> 00:07:44,300
these and the floating plane type
提起并倾倒内容物

253
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:46,480
these and the floating plane type
mechanism that we looked at in tutorial
背面的我可以向你展示这个

00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:46,490
mechanism that we looked at in tutorial
当您将标签整个拉回

255
00:07:46,490 --> 00:07:50,140
mechanism that we looked at in tutorial
12 is as you close the base the lid
卡车举起并丢下停机坪

256
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:50,150
12 is as you close the base the lid
或现在真的很特别

257
00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:53,860
12 is as you close the base the lid
sinks down and the outer end comes up so
一个让我去一个漂亮的雕塑

258
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:53,870
sinks down and the outer end comes up so
旧线发出一些

259
00:07:53,870 --> 00:07:56,020
sinks down and the outer end comes up so
it will stop you having anything that
chitty-chitty-bang-bang的标志

260
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:56,030
it will stop you having anything that
Paul Taylor的造纸工程，这是

261
00:07:56,030 --> 00:07:59,230
it will stop you having anything that
juts out forward you can have pieces
这辆车又是基于盒子的

262
00:07:59,230 --> 00:07:59,240
juts out forward you can have pieces
如果你看着它结束，你会看到

263
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:02,770
juts out forward you can have pieces
that are jetting out this way and this
中间有一个支柱

264
00:08:02,770 --> 00:08:02,780
that are jetting out this way and this
推上盖子盖子在里面

265
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:05,850
that are jetting out this way and this
way but in this case they can't just out
真的很难看你是否

266
00:08:05,850 --> 00:08:05,860
way but in this case they can't just out
这样看，您可能会看到

267
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:12,540
way but in this case they can't just out
directly from the top
里面有盖子

268


中央支柱向上推，然后

269
00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:14,650
so now I'm going to show you a whole
盖子将侧面推开，然后

270
00:08:14,650 --> 00:08:14,660
so now I'm going to show you a whole
汽车的引擎盖越过顶部，所以

271
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:17,620
so now I'm going to show you a whole
range of amazing pop ups and pop-up
在这些结构上，您必须具有

272
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:17,630
range of amazing pop ups and pop-up
盖在里面，因为当页面关闭时

273
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:19,630
range of amazing pop ups and pop-up
sculptures that are all up all based on
这本书合上盖子会掉下来，如果

274
00:08:19,630 --> 00:08:19,640

您想要引擎盖继续弹出

275
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:23,770
sculptures that are all up all based on
the box like this so this is this book
必须是单独的一块

276
00:08:23,770 --> 00:08:23,780
the box like this so this is this book
所以在支柱里面有盖子

277
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:25,930
the box like this so this is this book
is The Nutcracker by Nick Dench field
