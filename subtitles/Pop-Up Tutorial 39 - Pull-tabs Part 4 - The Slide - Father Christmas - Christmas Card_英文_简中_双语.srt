我将向您展示如何制作

3
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:35,910
I'm going to show you how to make this
相当复杂的父亲圣诞贺卡

4
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:35,920
I'm going to show you how to make this
当您拉动标签时，它会显示

5
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:38,279
I'm going to show you how to make this
rather complicated father Christmas card
消息确实需要一些测量

6
00:00:38,279 --> 00:00:38,289
rather complicated father Christmas card
很乖，但我会带领你

7
00:00:38,289 --> 00:00:41,369
rather complicated father Christmas card
and when you pull the tab it reveals the
通过一步一步，以便您可以

8
00:00:41,369 --> 00:00:41,379
and when you pull the tab it reveals the
自行设计所需的零件

9
00:00:41,379 --> 00:00:44,189
and when you pull the tab it reveals the
message it does take some measuring it
第一是这是基础表

10
00:00:44,189 --> 00:00:44,199
message it does take some measuring it
这张纸在这里你看

11
00:00:44,199 --> 00:00:45,779
message it does take some measuring it
is quite fiddly but I'll lead you
另一面，你可以看到何时放

12
00:00:45,779 --> 00:00:45,789
is quite fiddly but I'll lead you
这是插槽，这是插槽

13
00:00:45,789 --> 00:00:47,579
is quite fiddly but I'll lead you
through step by step so that you can
我把它切开了

14
00:00:47,579 --> 00:00:47,589
through step by step so that you can
这是重要的切口

15
00:00:47,589 --> 00:00:50,369
through step by step so that you can
make your own design the pieces you need
切开的东西是你切开的

16
00:00:50,369 --> 00:00:50,379
make your own design the pieces you need
稍微向后退一点

17
00:00:50,379 --> 00:00:53,009
make your own design the pieces you need
number one is this is the base sheet
卡可以提起并允许条带

18
00:00:53,009 --> 00:00:53,019
number one is this is the base sheet
如果您要在其中轻松移动

19
00:00:53,019 --> 00:00:54,930
number one is this is the base sheet
this sheet here you look at it on the
写下地带并在周围摇摆

20
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:54,940
this sheet here you look at it on the
那么它实际上可以卡住，所以我已经

21
00:00:54,940 --> 00:00:57,329
this sheet here you look at it on the
other side and you can see when you put
完成此操作后，我将条带穿过

22
00:00:57,329 --> 00:00:57,339
other side and you can see when you put
测量了需要的宽度

23
00:00:57,339 --> 00:00:59,520
other side and you can see when you put
it down here's the slot this is a slot
每个都变了毫米左右

24
00:00:59,520 --> 00:00:59,530
it down here's the slot this is a slot
边，然后像

25
00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:02,099
it down here's the slot this is a slot
that I've cut in it there's a slit here
所有这些带子需要加倍

26
00:01:02,099 --> 00:01:02,109
that I've cut in it there's a slit here
厚度和胶水，所以这是街

27
00:01:02,109 --> 00:01:04,649
that I've cut in it there's a slit here
this is the slit here the important
我已经把它折好了，现在

28
00:01:04,649 --> 00:01:04,659
this is the slit here the important
用胶水将它关闭，我也发现了很长时间

29
00:01:04,659 --> 00:01:06,330
this is the slit here the important
thing with slits is that you cut them
像这样从胶粘中剥离

30
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:06,340
thing with slits is that you cut them
如果把它们弄平就很好

31
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:09,480
thing with slits is that you cut them
back slightly at the end so a little bit
平放在桌子上，否则他们可以

32
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:09,490
back slightly at the end so a little bit
倾向于有点退缩或发展

33
00:01:09,490 --> 00:01:12,330
back slightly at the end so a little bit
of card can lift up and allow the strip
某种弯曲，所以有

34
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:12,340
of card can lift up and allow the strip
将胶水涂抹在整个背面

35
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:15,209
of card can lift up and allow the strip
to move easily within it if you go to
然后将其折叠

36
00:01:15,209 --> 00:01:15,219
to move easily within it if you go to
然后把它放平放在桌子上

37
00:01:15,219 --> 00:01:18,179
to move easily within it if you go to
write the strip and wobble around and
真的堆出来，你有一个真正的

38
00:01:18,179 --> 00:01:18,189
write the strip and wobble around and
好的扁条是下一个关键部分

39
00:01:18,189 --> 00:01:20,880
write the strip and wobble around and
then it can actually Jam so the way I've
是其中之一，所以这就像

40
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:20,890
then it can actually Jam so the way I've
这中央的位只是宽一点

41
00:01:20,890 --> 00:01:23,880
then it can actually Jam so the way I've
done this I put the strip across it and
比地带，然后其他两个

42
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:23,890
done this I put the strip across it and
折起来，剩下两个襟翼

43
00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:25,709
done this I put the strip across it and
measured how wide it needed to be and
在顶部，就在

44
00:01:25,709 --> 00:01:25,719
measured how wide it needed to be and
条带的顶部，以便将三个胶粘在一起

45
00:01:25,719 --> 00:01:28,469
measured how wide it needed to be and
just went a millimeter or so wider each
粘到中间部分

46
00:01:28,469 --> 00:01:28,479
just went a millimeter or so wider each
放置它真的很好

47
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:31,139
just went a millimeter or so wider each
side and then and cut it back as with
干燥，因为这些可怜的被剥夺了

48
00:01:31,139 --> 00:01:31,149
side and then and cut it back as with
机制你真正的一件事

49
00:01:31,149 --> 00:01:32,639
side and then and cut it back as with
all these strips they need to be double
不想要的是胶水渗出只是牙龈

50
00:01:32,639 --> 00:01:32,649
all these strips they need to be double
一切都停止了，并很好地阻止了它的移动

51
00:01:32,649 --> 00:01:36,499
all these strips they need to be double
thickness and glued so here's the street
这是这两个家伙过来

52
00:01:36,499 --> 00:01:36,509
thickness and glued so here's the street
看到折痕在同一点相遇

53
00:01:36,509 --> 00:01:41,099
thickness and glued so here's the street
I've scored it folded it and now just
然后有两个襟翼

54
00:01:41,099 --> 00:01:41,109
I've scored it folded it and now just
上

55
00:01:41,109 --> 00:01:48,989
I've scored it folded it and now just
glue it closed I've also found with long
我们只是被压扁了

56
00:01:48,989 --> 00:01:48,999
glue it closed I've also found with long
坚持到底，然后你坚持下去

57
00:01:48,999 --> 00:01:51,690
glue it closed I've also found with long
strips like this up from gluing them
通过缝隙结束，然后你把

58
00:01:51,690 --> 00:01:51,700
strips like this up from gluing them
这两个部分穿过那个插槽

59
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:54,810
strips like this up from gluing them
it's quite good if you smooth them out
压平它们，使它们光滑

60
00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:54,820
it's quite good if you smooth them out
它周围，然后胶合在一起

61
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:57,149
it's quite good if you smooth them out
flat on the table otherwise they can
与顶部齐平，所以这是一个

62
00:01:57,149 --> 00:01:57,159
flat on the table otherwise they can
全带上的变化

63
00:01:57,159 --> 00:01:59,910
flat on the table otherwise they can
tend to sort of back in a bit or develop
您可以在其中拉标签并制作一个

64
00:01:59,910 --> 00:01:59,920
tend to sort of back in a bit or develop
东西滑下页面，这是

65
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,739
tend to sort of back in a bit or develop
some sort of bending and so having
您的运动量

66
00:02:01,739 --> 00:02:01,749
some sort of bending and so having
片刻，这似乎正在工作

67
00:02:01,749 --> 00:02:05,660
some sort of bending and so having
smeared the glue all over the back of it
很好，所以这些是另一个

68
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:05,670
smeared the glue all over the back of it
这是这个实际的阵容

69
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:09,419
smeared the glue all over the back of it
and then then folded it shut
这样我要放两个

70
00:02:09,419 --> 00:02:09,429
and then then folded it shut
两侧都有折痕，因此可以折叠

71
00:02:09,429 --> 00:02:12,209
and then then folded it shut
then yeah put it flat on the table and
只需将卡片的背面变圆

72
00:02:12,209 --> 00:02:12,219
then yeah put it flat on the table and
下方留着一点胡须

73
00:02:12,219 --> 00:02:14,670
then yeah put it flat on the table and
really pile it out you've got a really
像这样的胡须

74
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:14,680
really pile it out you've got a really
我已经测量过了，所以它应该适合

75
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:18,630
really pile it out you've got a really
good flat strip the next crucial piece
在那儿，我认为这需要解决

76
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:18,640
good flat strip the next crucial piece
有点像我做的那样

77
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,970
good flat strip the next crucial piece
is one of these so this is a piece like
这种肤色

78
00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:20,980
is one of these so this is a piece like
我剪了

79
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:24,270
is one of these so this is a piece like
this the central bit is just a tad wider
这些孔在这些，以便

80
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:24,280
this the central bit is just a tad wider
眼睛将通过那里露出粉红色

81
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:26,759
this the central bit is just a tad wider
than the strip and then these two other
那会留在胡须后面，所以我会

82
00:02:26,759 --> 00:02:26,769
than the strip and then these two other
只需将其粘在上面

83
00:02:26,769 --> 00:02:29,879
than the strip and then these two other
bits fold in and there's two flaps left
现在把胡子粘在皮肤上

84
00:02:29,879 --> 00:02:29,889
bits fold in and there's two flaps left
继续在那里，所以胡须连接

85
00:02:29,889 --> 00:02:31,649
bits fold in and there's two flaps left
on the top and that goes right at the
它下面的胡须，你可以看到

86
00:02:31,649 --> 00:02:31,659
on the top and that goes right at the
通过我切入的眼孔

87
00:02:31,659 --> 00:02:35,809
on the top and that goes right at the
top of the strip so you glue the three
肤色与眼睛相配

88
00:02:35,809 --> 00:02:35,819
top of the strip so you glue the three
破坏绿色植物的孔

89
00:02:35,819 --> 00:02:40,470
top of the strip so you glue the three
central sections once you've glued into
这样就可以贴在那里

90
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:40,480
central sections once you've glued into
在我做之前，我要坚持下去

91
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,390
central sections once you've glued into
place it's good to just let it really
绿色的一侧将胶水全部倒下

92
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:42,400
place it's good to just let it really
一侧在这里，这与

93
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,159
place it's good to just let it really
dry because with these poor stripped
那里的顶部，所以像

94
00:02:44,159 --> 00:02:44,169
dry because with these poor stripped
那，我们对此感到满意，或者我们可以

95
00:02:44,169 --> 00:02:45,899
dry because with these poor stripped
mechanisms the one thing you really
也将另一面向下粘

96
00:02:45,899 --> 00:02:45,909
mechanisms the one thing you really
然后这些像这样继续下去

97
00:02:45,909 --> 00:02:49,050
mechanisms the one thing you really
don't want is glue oozing that just gums
整理我可能需要的胡须

98
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:49,060
don't want is glue oozing that just gums
修剪一下，使其稍稍对齐

99
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:51,170
don't want is glue oozing that just gums
it all up and stops it moving nicely
像那样

100
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:51,180
it all up and stops it moving nicely
你知道

101
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:55,949
it all up and stops it moving nicely
here is these two guys come over you can
把这块胶粘下来，使所有的线

102
00:02:55,949 --> 00:02:55,959
here is these two guys come over you can
留着眼睛，所以当你拉这个

103
00:02:55,959 --> 00:02:58,050
here is these two guys come over you can
see the creases meet at the same point
你得到扩展名下来，

104
00:02:58,050 --> 00:02:58,060
see the creases meet at the same point
现在离开这个的原因，所以你

105
00:02:58,060 --> 00:03:00,300
see the creases meet at the same point
and then there's these two flaps stand
可以举起它，现在你标记在哪里

106
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:00,310
and then there's these two flaps stand
眼睛实际上会进入

107
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:00,780
and then there's these two flaps stand
up
这一直都在眼前

108
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:00,790
up
在这里，然后一路走来

109
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:03,990
up
we're just pressed up flat you glue this
向下，我们希望眼睛在这里

110
00:03:03,990 --> 00:03:04,000
we're just pressed up flat you glue this
另一面，所以现在我们可以打开它

111
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,399
we're just pressed up flat you glue this
piece on to the end then you stick this
我们将这两个标记合在一起

112
00:03:08,399 --> 00:03:08,409
piece on to the end then you stick this
就像你可以去一个

113
00:03:08,409 --> 00:03:12,690
piece on to the end then you stick this
end through the slit and then you put
实际上有点宽，这是

114
00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:12,700
end through the slit and then you put
眼睛，我们可以将其阴影

115
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:18,229
end through the slit and then you put
these two pieces up through that slot
然后检查一下，以便关闭

116
00:03:18,229 --> 00:03:18,239
these two pieces up through that slot
向上推，向下推，你可以看到

117
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:24,990
these two pieces up through that slot
flatten them out put glue on them smooth
如果您满意的话，眼睛就会动

118
00:03:24,990 --> 00:03:25,000
flatten them out put glue on them smooth
这样，您已经将它们阴影足够

119
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,819
flatten them out put glue on them smooth
it around and then this glues up pretty
那么你可以将另一面向下

120
00:03:29,819 --> 00:03:29,829
it around and then this glues up pretty
所以你把胶水放在那里

121
00:03:29,829 --> 00:03:36,000
it around and then this glues up pretty
much flush with the top so this is one
当您坚持使用这些

122
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:36,010
much flush with the top so this is one
白色的眼睛，它的眼睛和

123
00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:38,309
much flush with the top so this is one
of the variations on the full strip
这是胡须下的胡须

124
00:03:38,309 --> 00:03:38,319
of the variations on the full strip
这个白色一直到

125
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:41,039
of the variations on the full strip
where you can pull a tab and make a
顶部在这里，所以我们必须离开

126
00:03:41,039 --> 00:03:41,049
where you can pull a tab and make a
下拉时眼睛的空间

127
00:03:41,049 --> 00:03:43,349
where you can pull a tab and make a
thing slide down the page this is the
要容纳的冰

128
00:03:43,349 --> 00:03:43,359
thing slide down the page this is the
当此位下降时，您必须

129
00:03:43,359 --> 00:03:44,789
thing slide down the page this is the
amount of movement you've got at the
确保它没有下降到目前为止

130
00:03:44,789 --> 00:03:44,799
amount of movement you've got at the
它实际上出现在这里

131
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:47,129
amount of movement you've got at the
moment so that seems to be working
拉下胡子，现在你已经

132
00:03:47,129 --> 00:03:47,139
moment so that seems to be working
这个拉条太长了

133
00:03:47,139 --> 00:03:49,890
moment so that seems to be working
pretty nicely so these are the other
当然你把它推到完全推开

134
00:03:49,890 --> 00:03:49,900
pretty nicely so these are the other
向上的位置，然后将其剪断

135
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:53,490
pretty nicely so these are the other
pieces this is this actual lineup piece
碰巧我有关于

136
00:03:53,490 --> 00:03:53,500
pieces this is this actual lineup piece
正确的长度，所以它移动的量是

137
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:56,729
pieces this is this actual lineup piece
this is going to go like this I put two
完全正确，但是如果您已经

138
00:03:56,729 --> 00:03:56,739
this is going to go like this I put two
花费了太多时间，所以这个

139
00:03:56,739 --> 00:04:00,119
this is going to go like this I put two
creases on each side so it can fold
当你拉它之前

140
00:04:00,119 --> 00:04:00,129
creases on each side so it can fold
