00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:27,920
Alibaba this is also 1950 1947 something
like that if you look from the top
更短的那一块将要去

38
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:27,930
like that if you look from the top
直对面

39
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:30,020
like that if you look from the top
you'll see that there's six sections or
他们都已经折叠了，我要去

40
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:30,030
you'll see that there's six sections or
如果您想将前片变灰

41

you'll see that there's six sections or
like six segments you'll see there's
做成六块做成圆饼

42
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:32,370
like six segments you'll see there's
像那个阿里巴巴，那你就得承担

43
00:01:32,370 --> 00:01:35,090
like six segments you'll see there's
this is the base bit and then this is
请记住，这个角度必须是

44
00:01:35,090 --> 00:01:35,100
this is the base bit and then this is
六十度，因为将有六个

45
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:37,430
this is the base bit and then this is
the front piece that dictates how wide
他们加起来就是360我就是

46
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:37,440
the front piece that dictates how wide
制作一个，所以它不是真的

47
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:39,470
the front piece that dictates how wide
the whole spread will go and then you
就是适合我的东西，所以我

48
00:01:39,470 --> 00:01:39,480
the whole spread will go and then you
要把它放在适当的位置看

49
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:41,630
the whole spread will go and then you
have two other pieces this is slightly
大概在我需要折叠的地方

50
00:01:41,630 --> 00:01:41,640
have two other pieces this is slightly
使这些标签贴在上面

51
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:43,730
have two other pieces this is slightly
longer than the first one this is
我要留下一个标记，以便我可以

52
00:01:43,730 --> 00:01:43,740
longer than the first one this is
大致看到那些放在哪里

53
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:45,649
longer than the first one this is
slightly longer than the second one and
碗会在这里折叠

54
00:01:45,649 --> 00:01:45,659
slightly longer than the second one and
一半

55
00:01:45,659 --> 00:01:47,810
slightly longer than the second one and
they're all slightly shorter than the
放在那里，这就是

56
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:47,820
they're all slightly shorter than the
整个事情都会开放-所以

57
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:50,030
they're all slightly shorter than the
final one so now I'll make one so you
每侧会有两个标签

58
00:01:50,030 --> 00:01:50,040
final one so now I'll make one so you
在我把它放进去之前

59
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:51,610
final one so now I'll make one so you
can see how to do it
必须要制造另一个

60
00:01:51,610 --> 00:01:51,620
can see how to do it
在蓝色和黄色之间

61
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:54,280
can see how to do it
I'm going to make this the base piece
我将以此为指导

62
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:54,290
I'm going to make this the base piece
比蓝色长，但仍然会

63
00:01:54,290 --> 00:01:57,200
I'm going to make this the base piece
this piece I've already made this is
比黄色短，让我们做

64
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:57,210
this piece I've already made this is
在这里，我将其折叠

65
00:01:57,210 --> 00:01:59,420
this piece I've already made this is
going to be number two it's going to fit
我们将检查它的状况

66
00:01:59,420 --> 00:01:59,430
going to be number two it's going to fit
会合在一起好吗

67
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:03,560
going to be number two it's going to fit
in like this and so you can see there's
黄色是四号蓝色是二号

68
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:03,570
in like this and so you can see there's
和灰色作为第一，这将

69
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:04,940
in like this and so you can see there's
going to be one piece that's longer
像这样，你看着它恩顿是

70
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:04,950
going to be one piece that's longer
会像那样，在你之前

71
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:06,980
going to be one piece that's longer
that's going to go in there and another
用胶水将它们切开

72
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:06,990
that's going to go in there and another
需要对所有这些进行设计

73
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:08,330
that's going to go in there and another
piece that's shorter that's going to go
并在上面切孔

74
00:02:08,330 --> 00:02:08,340
piece that's shorter that's going to go
这是第一名

75
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:10,280
piece that's shorter that's going to go
straight across the front
是您正在寻找的屏幕

76
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:10,290
straight across the front
通过，所以我要做的是

77
00:02:10,290 --> 00:02:12,929
straight across the front
they're all already folded I'm going to
真的很简单，只是切一个矩形

78
00:02:12,929 --> 00:02:12,939
they're all already folded I'm going to
从中

79
00:02:12,939 --> 00:02:17,160
they're all already folded I'm going to
make the front piece grey if you want to
所以这将是最前沿

80
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:17,170
make the front piece grey if you want to
将成为我们不削减的背部

81
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:20,309
make the front piece grey if you want to
make it six pieces to make a roundel
任何东西，这将是

82
00:02:20,309 --> 00:02:20,319
make it six pieces to make a roundel
您正在寻找的第二个

83
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:22,649
make it six pieces to make a roundel
like that Alibaba then you have to bear
然后这将是最后一个

84
00:02:22,649 --> 00:02:22,659
like that Alibaba then you have to bear
为此，您确实需要解决您的问题

85
00:02:22,659 --> 00:02:25,080
like that Alibaba then you have to bear
in mind that this angle will have to be
设计任何您想画的东西

86
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:25,090
in mind that this angle will have to be
剪掉，我会做些事

87
00:02:25,090 --> 00:02:27,720
in mind that this angle will have to be
sixty degrees because there'll be six of
我认为很基本​​，但很大

88
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:27,730
sixty degrees because there'll be six of
因为你希望能够看到

89
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:30,899
sixty degrees because there'll be six of
them adding up to 360 as it is I'm just
通过它到第三级，然后

90
00:02:30,899 --> 00:02:30,909
them adding up to 360 as it is I'm just
这是最后一个

91
00:02:30,909 --> 00:02:32,190
them adding up to 360 as it is I'm just
making the one so it doesn't really
第三是你的最后一件事

92
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:32,200
making the one so it doesn't really
翻阅，以便可能更小

93
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:36,089
making the one so it doesn't really
matter it's just what suits me so I'm
洞，所以你有一点点显示

94
00:02:36,089 --> 00:02:36,099
matter it's just what suits me so I'm
它的右边蓝色部分隐藏了它

95
00:02:36,099 --> 00:02:38,789
matter it's just what suits me so I'm
going to put this in position to see
所以我们将基本文件夹折痕定为

96
00:02:38,789 --> 00:02:38,799
going to put this in position to see
真的很好，只需将它们粘在胶上

97
00:02:38,799 --> 00:02:41,880
going to put this in position to see
roughly where I need to make the folds
同时在他们身上

98
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:41,890
roughly where I need to make the folds
好吧，如果你想要的话，这会在这里

99
00:02:41,890 --> 00:02:44,430
roughly where I need to make the folds
to make these tabs that will stick it on
在这一点上还不算太晚

100
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:44,440
to make these tabs that will stick it on
实际上将其他碎片粘在

101
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:47,520
to make these tabs that will stick it on
I'm going to make a mark so I can just
您只想添加到其他颜色

102
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:47,530
I'm going to make a mark so I can just
这是你轻松做到的机会

103
00:02:47,530 --> 00:02:49,949
I'm going to make a mark so I can just
see roughly where to put those
然后像这样粘在上面

104
00:02:49,949 --> 00:02:49,959
see roughly where to put those
二级关闭它，然后按

105
00:02:49,959 --> 00:02:55,589
see roughly where to put those
bowls it's going to be about here fold
它坚决确保一切正常

106
00:02:55,589 --> 00:02:55,599
bowls it's going to be about here fold
很好，现在我们将第三级

107
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:57,259
bowls it's going to be about here fold
that in half
看着这个我实际上并不喜欢

108
00:02:57,259 --> 00:02:57,269
that in half
那片蓝色的东西被困在我只是

109
00:02:57,269 --> 00:03:01,020
that in half
hold it there so this is how wide the
要脱掉我想，如果

110
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:01,030
hold it there so this is how wide the
它是红色或完全红色

111
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:05,039
hold it there so this is how wide the
whole thing is gonna open up - so
不同，它本来可以工作，但是

112
00:03:05,039 --> 00:03:05,049
whole thing is gonna open up - so
只是弄糊了整个设计

113
00:03:05,049 --> 00:03:09,000
whole thing is gonna open up - so
there's gonna be two tabs on each side
然后这是最后一块

114
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:09,010
there's gonna be two tabs on each side
指示场景有多宽的那个

115
00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:18,150
there's gonna be two tabs on each side
of that and before I put that in I've
将会打开那里，所以这只是一个

116
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:18,160
of that and before I put that in I've
真正的粗略设计向您展示如何

117
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:20,189
of that and before I put that in I've
got to make another one that's coming in
作品，以及如何将它们放在一起

118
00:03:20,189 --> 00:03:20,199
got to make another one that's coming in
该机制的重点是

119
00:03:20,199 --> 00:03:21,979
got to make another one that's coming in
between the blue one and the yellow one
你可以产生一个非常美好的

120
00:03:21,979 --> 00:03:21,989
between the blue one and the yellow one
深度感和透视感

121
00:03:21,989 --> 00:03:25,199
between the blue one and the yellow one
I'll use this as a guide and make it
玩它，真的

122
00:03:25,199 --> 00:03:25,209
I'll use this as a guide and make it
从事设计和思考

123
00:03:25,209 --> 00:03:28,110
I'll use this as a guide and make it
longer than the blue but it'll still be
这里不对称，我们有阿里巴巴

124
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:28,120
longer than the blue but it'll still be
可以看到他玩耍的方式

125
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:30,800
longer than the blue but it'll still be
shorter than the yellow so let's make it
产生观点的机制

126
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:30,810
shorter than the yellow so let's make it
还有一些非常有趣的设计

127
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:52,570
shorter than the yellow so let's make it
about here so I'll fold that
我觉得这些真的很聪明

只需解开它即可看到相机

131
00:03:56,220 --> 00:04:02,000
and we'll just check how well this is
going to all fit together okay
所以这里是封面阿里·巴巴和
