00:00:45,069 --> 00:00:49,290
pop-ups so here's an example this is the
box and the way it works is quite basic

10
00:00:49,290 --> 00:00:49,300
box and the way it works is quite basic

11
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:52,079
box and the way it works is quite basic
if you look at it this way you can see

12
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:52,089
if you look at it this way you can see

13
00:00:52,089 --> 00:00:55,319
if you look at it this way you can see
it's actually 2 parallelograms centered

14
00:00:55,319 --> 00:00:55,329
it's actually 2 parallelograms centered

15
00:00:55,329 --> 00:00:58,439
it's actually 2 parallelograms centered
on the central spine fold this central

out the top of the sides this is crucial

20
00:01:04,049 --> 00:01:04,059
out the top of the sides this is crucial

21
00:01:04,059 --> 00:01:08,819
out the top of the sides this is crucial
and then you have this piece that joins

22
00:01:08,819 --> 00:01:08,829
and then you have this piece that joins

23
00:01:08,829 --> 00:01:10,139
and then you have this piece that joins
the two outer edges

24
00:01:10,139 --> 00:01:10,149
the two outer edges

25
00:01:10,149 --> 00:01:11,700
the two outer edges
that's what locks the whole piece into

26
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:11,710
that's what locks the whole piece into

27
00:01:11,710 --> 00:01:14,999
that's what locks the whole piece into

three times so you got one two three you

78
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:43,130
three times so you got one two three you

79
00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:46,150
three times so you got one two three you
want strips so we're just making a

80
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:46,160
want strips so we're just making a

81
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:49,059
want strips so we're just making a
really simple small box so these are

82
00:02:49,059 --> 00:02:49,069
really simple small box so these are

83
00:02:49,069 --> 00:02:50,920
really simple small box so these are
going to be cut lines rather than score

84
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:50,930
going to be cut lines rather than score

85
00:02:50,930 --> 00:02:51,430
going to be cut lines rather than score
lines

86
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:51,440
lines

87
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:54,250
lines
so we'll just draw it in there there's

88
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:54,260
so we'll just draw it in there there's

89
00:02:54,260 --> 00:03:03,840
so we'll just draw it in there there's
one there one here and two more in here

90
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:03,850


91
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:09,910
that don't go all the way up so early so

92
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:09,920
that don't go all the way up so early so

93
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,289
that don't go all the way up so early so
when you cut it out I'm just going to

94
00:03:11,289 --> 00:03:11,299
when you cut it out I'm just going to

95
00:03:11,299 --> 00:03:13,030
when you cut it out I'm just going to
use a craft knife rather than scissors

96
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:13,040
use a craft knife rather than scissors

97
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,949
use a craft knife rather than scissors
and it's just for speed but you can use

98
00:03:14,949 --> 00:03:14,959
and it's just for speed but you can use

99
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:17,949
and it's just for speed but you can use
you can use either so just cut along

100
00:03:17,949 --> 00:03:17,959
you can use either so just cut along

101
00:03:17,959 --> 00:03:21,430
you can use either so just cut along
these these lines so you're making four

102
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:21,440
these these lines so you're making four

103
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:27,940
these these lines so you're making four
strips you might want to cut against the

104
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:27,950
strips you might want to cut against the

105
00:03:27,950 --> 00:03:33,910
strips you might want to cut against the
metal ruler but I usually just do it by

106
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:33,920
metal ruler but I usually just do it by

107
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:36,849
metal ruler but I usually just do it by
eye and then trim these up

108
00:03:36,849 --> 00:03:36,859
eye and then trim these up

109
00:03:36,859 --> 00:03:48,340
eye and then trim these up
so two like that and two like this here

110
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:48,350
so two like that and two like this here

111
00:03:48,350 --> 00:03:50,770
so two like that and two like this here
we are got two short ones which are just

112
00:03:50,770 --> 00:03:50,780
we are got two short ones which are just

113
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:52,780
we are got two short ones which are just
two squares with a tab on each end and

114
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:52,790
two squares with a tab on each end and

00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:55,990
two squares with a tab on each end and
you have two long ones that are three

116
00:03:55,990 --> 00:03:56,000
you have two long ones that are three

117
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,670
you have two long ones that are three
squares of the tab on each end and we'll

118
00:03:57,670 --> 00:03:57,680
squares of the tab on each end and we'll

119
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:09,440
squares of the tab on each end and we'll
just fold all those those fold lines

120
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:09,450


121
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:12,479
so here's your base sheet a single piece

122

00:04:16,710 --> 00:04:16,720
of card thoroughly creased and then you

125
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:19,949
of card thoroughly creased and then you
have your your four step of strips that

126
00:04:19,949 --> 00:04:19,959
have your your four step of strips that

127
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:21,960
have your your four step of strips that
are going to make the box so you've got

128
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:21,970
are going to make the box so you've got

129
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:25,950
are going to make the box so you've got
two long ones two short ones so take one

130
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:25,960
two long ones two short ones so take one

131
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:30,770
two long ones two short ones so take one
of these long ones put glue on one end

132
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:30,780
of these long ones put glue on one end

133
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:34,469
of these long ones put glue on one end
you glue you glue this one end flush

134
00:04:34,469 --> 00:04:34,479
you glue you glue this one end flush

135
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:40,040
you glue you glue this one end flush
with the spine so it's like that then

136
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:40,050
with the spine so it's like that then

137
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:42,810
with the spine so it's like that then
you can just fold out just make sure

138
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:42,820
you can just fold out just make sure

139
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:45,810
you can just fold out just make sure
it's really comfortable there so that

140
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:45,820
it's really comfortable there so that

141
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:48,510
it's really comfortable there so that
that's one you now fold it into its

142
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:48,520
that's one you now fold it into its

143
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:49,650
that's one you now fold it into its
closed position

144
00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:49,660
closed position

145
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:53,129
closed position

on the other side of the spine so you

156
00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:06,820
on the other side of the spine so you

157
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:10,920
on the other side of the spine so you
take your other three panel strip put

the other end of that strip put it in
its closed position shut the base okay

166
00:05:40,469 --> 00:05:40,479
its closed position shut the base okay

167
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:44,610
its closed position shut the base okay
now you've got two parallelograms back

168
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:44,620
now you've got two parallelograms back

169
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:46,860
now you've got two parallelograms back
to back this is still an unstable

170
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:46,870
to back this is still an unstable

171
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:49,230
to back this is still an unstable
structure at this point if you're going

172
00:05:49,230 --> 00:05:49,240
structure at this point if you're going

173
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:51,000
structure at this point if you're going
to want something coming up out of the

174
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:51,010
to want something coming up out of the

175
00:05:51,010 --> 00:05:52,950
to want something coming up out of the
middle if you want something like the

176
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:52,960
middle if you want something like the

177
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,899

now's your chance to put it in so if you

182
00:06:00,719 --> 00:06:00,729
now's your chance to put it in so if you

183
00:06:00,729 --> 00:06:03,180
now's your chance to put it in so if you
want that stick it in now otherwise now

00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:13,060
this central pillar takes quite a lot of

191
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:14,520
this central pillar takes quite a lot of
stress so it's good to have it double

thickness card so is it it can push up

194
00:06:17,159 --> 00:06:17,169
thickness card so is it it can push up

195
00:06:17,169 --> 00:06:20,290
thickness card so is it it can push up
the top quite easily without buckling

is just to parallelograms and as you can

200
00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:24,800
is just to parallelograms and as you can

201
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,740
is just to parallelograms and as you can
see it just wobbles around this is

202
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:26,750
see it just wobbles around this is

203
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:28,600
see it just wobbles around this is
actually the basis of really early

pop-ups the Victorian pop-ups were just

206
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:30,710
pop-ups the Victorian pop-ups were just

207
00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:32,920
pop-ups the Victorian pop-ups were just
made with parallelograms like this which

208
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:32,930
made with parallelograms like this which

209
00:06:32,930 --> 00:06:34,780
made with parallelograms like this which
gave you a floating plane above the page

210
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:34,790
gave you a floating plane above the page

211
00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:37,000
gave you a floating plane above the page
but there wasn't stable they could just

rigid structure then you take one of

216
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:42,530
rigid structure then you take one of

217
00:06:42,530 --> 00:06:46,090
rigid structure then you take one of
these two panel pieces and these stick

218
00:06:46,090 --> 00:06:46,100
these two panel pieces and these stick

219
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:49,150
these two panel pieces and these stick
across they attach to the outer Plains

you can put glue on both tabs at the

232
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:03,110
you can put glue on both tabs at the

233
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:13,090
you can put glue on both tabs at the
same time glue them in glue them on shut

00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:26,270
a this is a rigid structure you don't

239
00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:28,870
a this is a rigid structure you don't
need the panel on the other end only if

240
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:28,880
need the panel on the other end only if

241
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,310
need the panel on the other end only if
you're really wanting to make a solid

242
00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:30,320
you're really wanting to make a solid

243
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:32,950
you're really wanting to make a solid
box also it doesn't need to be the full

244
00:07:32,950 --> 00:07:32,960
box also it doesn't need to be the full

245
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:36,370
box also it doesn't need to be the full
height of the of the box yeah as long as

246
00:07:36,370 --> 00:07:36,380
height of the of the box yeah as long as

247
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:39,400
height of the of the box yeah as long as
it's joining the two outer planes then

248
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:39,410
it's joining the two outer planes then

249
00:07:39,410 --> 00:07:41,800
it's joining the two outer planes then
it will work the difference between

250
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:41,810
it will work the difference between

251
00:07:41,810 --> 00:07:44,290
it will work the difference between
these and the floating plane type

252
00:07:44,290 --> 00:07:44,300
these and the floating plane type

12 is as you close the base the lid

256
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:50,150
12 is as you close the base the lid

257
00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:53,860
12 is as you close the base the lid
sinks down and the outer end comes up so

258
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:53,870
sinks down and the outer end comes up so

259
00:07:53,870 --> 00:07:56,020
sinks down and the outer end comes up so
it will stop you having anything that

260
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:56,030
it will stop you having anything that

261
00:07:56,030 --> 00:07:59,230
it will stop you having anything that
juts out forward you can have pieces

262
00:07:59,230 --> 00:07:59,240
juts out forward you can have pieces

263
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:02,770
juts out forward you can have pieces
that are jetting out this way and this

264
00:08:02,770 --> 00:08:02,780
that are jetting out this way and this

265
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:05,850
that are jetting out this way and this
way but in this case they can't just out

266
00:08:05,850 --> 00:08:05,860
way but in this case they can't just out

267
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:12,540
way but in this case they can't just out
directly from the top

268

tutorial is this piece at the back this

284
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:34,190
tutorial is this piece at the back this

285
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:37,600
tutorial is this piece at the back this
is the box so as the rest folds down the

286
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:37,610
is the box so as the rest folds down the

287
00:08:37,610 --> 00:08:40,390
is the box so as the rest folds down the
rest is all based on defaults the box at

the back stays stays vertical we look at

290
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:43,850
the back stays stays vertical we look at

291
00:08:43,850 --> 00:08:46,660
the back stays stays vertical we look at
the back of it you can see here's the

292
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:46,670
the back of it you can see here's the

293
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:49,000
the back of it you can see here's the
central pillar that pushes up the lid on

294
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:49,010
central pillar that pushes up the lid on

295
00:08:49,010 --> 00:08:50,770
central pillar that pushes up the lid on
the top and then the lid pushes out

296
00:08:50,770 --> 00:08:50,780
the top and then the lid pushes out

297
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:52,990
the top and then the lid pushes out
there the top of the walls at the side

298
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:53,000
there the top of the walls at the side

299
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,720
there the top of the walls at the side
so as it closes you can see how that

300
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:55,730
so as it closes you can see how that

301
00:08:55,730 --> 00:09:00,490
so as it closes you can see how that
works so that that's the box is part of

302
00:09:00,490 --> 00:09:00,500
works so that that's the box is part of

303
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:05,770
works so that that's the box is part of
a part of a big display the next one I'd

this is an interesting variation this is

310
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:14,150
this is an interesting variation this is

311
00:09:14,150 --> 00:09:17,530
this is an interesting variation this is
a a circular variation is still stacked

312
00:09:17,530 --> 00:09:17,540
a a circular variation is still stacked

313
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:19,420
a a circular variation is still stacked
down parallel to the spine on each side

314
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:19,430
down parallel to the spine on each side

315
00:09:19,430 --> 00:09:21,550
down parallel to the spine on each side
but the ends are rounded more like the

316
00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:21,560
but the ends are rounded more like the

317
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:22,810

boat that I showed you at the beginning

318
00:09:22,810 --> 00:09:22,820
boat that I showed you at the beginning

319
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:26,200
boat that I showed you at the beginning
and as you close the base you can see

320
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:26,210
and as you close the base you can see

321
00:09:26,210 --> 00:09:28,960
and as you close the base you can see
that the top of the box sinks down and

322
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:28,970
that the top of the box sinks down and

323
00:09:28,970 --> 00:09:31,270
that the top of the box sinks down and
this has a chunk cut away from the side

324
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:31,280
this has a chunk cut away from the side

325
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:33,870
this has a chunk cut away from the side
so you can see inside you can see the

326
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:33,880

paper engineering by Paul Taylor this is

520
00:14:12,470 --> 00:14:12,480
paper engineering by Paul Taylor this is

521
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:15,980
paper engineering by Paul Taylor this is
the car again this is based on the box

522
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:15,990
the car again this is based on the box

523
00:14:15,990 --> 00:14:17,960
the car again this is based on the box
if you look at it end on you'll see

524
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:17,970
if you look at it end on you'll see

525
00:14:17,970 --> 00:14:19,630
if you look at it end on you'll see
there's a pillar in the middle that

526
00:14:19,630 --> 00:14:19,640
there's a pillar in the middle that

527
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:23,420
there's a pillar in the middle that
pushes up the lid the lid is inside it's

528
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:23,430
pushes up the lid the lid is inside it's

529
00:14:23,430 --> 00:14:25,970
pushes up the lid the lid is inside it's
really it's really hard to see if you

530
00:14:25,970 --> 00:14:25,980
really it's really hard to see if you

531
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:27,380
really it's really hard to see if you
look this way you can probably see

532
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:27,390
look this way you can probably see

533
00:14:27,390 --> 00:14:30,079
look this way you can probably see
inside there is the lid which the

534
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:30,089
inside there is the lid which the

535
00:14:30,089 --> 00:14:32,150
inside there is the lid which the
central pillar pushes up and then the

536
00:14:32,150 --> 00:14:32,160
central pillar pushes up and then the

537
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:34,639
central pillar pushes up and then the
lid pushes out the sides and then the

538
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:34,649
lid pushes out the sides and then the

539
00:14:34,649 --> 00:14:38,210
lid pushes out the sides and then the
bonnet of the car goes over the top so

540
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:38,220
bonnet of the car goes over the top so

541
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:40,100
bonnet of the car goes over the top so
on these structures you have to have the

542
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:40,110
on these structures you have to have the

543
00:14:40,110 --> 00:14:42,800
on these structures you have to have the
lid inside because as the page closes as

544
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:42,810
lid inside because as the page closes as

545
00:14:42,810 --> 00:14:45,800
lid inside because as the page closes as
the book closes the lid goes down and if

546
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:45,810
the book closes the lid goes down and if

547
00:14:45,810 --> 00:14:48,069
the book closes the lid goes down and if
you want the bonnet to stay popping up

548
00:14:48,069 --> 00:14:48,079
you want the bonnet to stay popping up

549
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:50,300
you want the bonnet to stay popping up
that has to be a separate piece

550
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:50,310
that has to be a separate piece

551
00:14:50,310 --> 00:14:53,240
that has to be a separate piece
so there's the lid inside the pillar in

552
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:53,250
so there's the lid inside the pillar in

553
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:55,880
so there's the lid inside the pillar in
the center pushes up the lid that lid

554
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:55,890
the center pushes up the lid that lid

555
00:14:55,890 --> 00:14:57,710
the center pushes up the lid that lid
pushes out the walls on the side and

556
00:14:57,710 --> 00:14:57,720
pushes out the walls on the side and

557
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:59,870
pushes out the walls on the side and
then this is a separate piece stuff on

558
00:14:59,870 --> 00:14:59,880
then this is a separate piece stuff on

559
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:04,490
then this is a separate piece stuff on
top next we've got the Wizard of Oz by

560
00:15:04,490 --> 00:15:04,500
top next we've got the Wizard of Oz by

561
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:10,329
top next we've got the Wizard of Oz by
Roberts óbuda and then in this spread

562
00:15:10,329 --> 00:15:10,339


563
00:15:10,339 --> 00:15:14,690
this house is the box so if you look at

564
00:15:14,690 --> 00:15:14,700
this house is the box so if you look at

565
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:18,230
this house is the box so if you look at
it end on you'll see there is a pillar

566
00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:18,240
it end on you'll see there is a pillar

567
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:21,079
it end on you'll see there is a pillar
pushes up this little bit here and then

568
00:15:21,079 --> 00:15:21,089
pushes up this little bit here and then

569
00:15:21,089 --> 00:15:23,540
pushes up this little bit here and then
this is a piece that links the two outer

570
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:23,550
this is a piece that links the two outer

571
00:15:23,550 --> 00:15:26,840
this is a piece that links the two outer
walls so this is using the box with the

572
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:26,850
walls so this is using the box with the

573
00:15:26,850 --> 00:15:29,269
walls so this is using the box with the
book as a background rather than a base

574
00:15:29,269 --> 00:15:29,279
book as a background rather than a base

575
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:32,540
book as a background rather than a base
so there is you can see just the way as

576
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:32,550
so there is you can see just the way as

577
00:15:32,550 --> 00:15:35,840
so there is you can see just the way as
on this here's the original one I showed

578
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:35,850
on this here's the original one I showed

579
00:15:35,850 --> 00:15:38,900
on this here's the original one I showed
you so you can see as it closes the lid

580
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:38,910
you so you can see as it closes the lid

581
00:15:38,910 --> 00:15:42,260
you so you can see as it closes the lid
goes down but the the wall that locks it

582
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:42,270
goes down but the the wall that locks it

583
00:15:42,270 --> 00:15:45,350
goes down but the the wall that locks it
all into shape that comes forward so in

584
00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:45,360
all into shape that comes forward so in

585
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,480
all into shape that comes forward so in
effect what we've got in this case is

586
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:47,490
effect what we've got in this case is

587
00:15:47,490 --> 00:15:49,880
effect what we've got in this case is
this this is the roof of the house going

588
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:49,890
this this is the roof of the house going

589
00:15:49,890 --> 00:15:53,480
this this is the roof of the house going
up as it closes and here it is as it

590
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:53,490
up as it closes and here it is as it

591
00:15:53,490 --> 00:15:55,190
up as it closes and here it is as it
closes you can see the roof of the house

592
00:15:55,190 --> 00:15:55,200
closes you can see the roof of the house

593
00:15:55,200 --> 00:16:00,110
closes you can see the roof of the house
going up so this on the side is another

594
00:16:00,110 --> 00:16:00,120
going up so this on the side is another

595
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:02,420
going up so this on the side is another
separate interesting mechanism this is

596
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:02,430
separate interesting mechanism this is

597
00:16:02,430 --> 00:16:04,640
separate interesting mechanism this is
the automatic pull strip that we look at

598
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:04,650
the automatic pull strip that we look at

599
00:16:04,650 --> 00:16:09,260
the automatic pull strip that we look at
in tutorial 16 so this is the last one

600
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:09,270
