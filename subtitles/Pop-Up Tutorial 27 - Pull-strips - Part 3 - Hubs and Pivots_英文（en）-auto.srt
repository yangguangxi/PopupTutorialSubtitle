it's ways of joining two pieces of card
together so they're flat and they can

6
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:41,270
together so they're flat and they can

7
00:00:41,270 --> 00:00:42,880
together so they're flat and they can
turn in this case you've got this

8
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:42,890
turn in this case you've got this

00:00:42,890 --> 00:00:45,430
turn in this case you've got this
turning wheel it's got a window in the

10
00:00:45,430 --> 00:00:45,440
turning wheel it's got a window in the

11
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:47,920
turning wheel it's got a window in the
wheel and the images are on the page

12
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:47,930
wheel and the images are on the page

13
00:00:47,930 --> 00:00:50,229
wheel and the images are on the page
behind it or you can use it the other

14
00:00:50,229 --> 00:00:50,239
behind it or you can use it the other

15
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:52,750
behind it or you can use it the other
way around so you have a window in the

16
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:52,760
way around so you have a window in the

17
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:55,990
way around so you have a window in the
page as you turn the wheel the image

18
00:00:55,990 --> 00:00:56,000
page as you turn the wheel the image

19
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:02,729
page as you turn the wheel the image
changes this is the way you make it

20
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:02,739
changes this is the way you make it

21
00:01:02,739 --> 00:01:06,460
changes this is the way you make it
basically there's a wheel with a hole in

22
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:06,470
basically there's a wheel with a hole in

23
00:01:06,470 --> 00:01:09,160
basically there's a wheel with a hole in
it and then you have this hub the hub is

24
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:09,170
it and then you have this hub the hub is

25
00:01:09,170 --> 00:01:11,770
it and then you have this hub the hub is
just a circular piece with two little

26
00:01:11,770 --> 00:01:11,780
just a circular piece with two little

27
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:15,090
just a circular piece with two little
tabs that fold up it sticks to the page

28
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:15,100
tabs that fold up it sticks to the page

29
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:17,500
tabs that fold up it sticks to the page
they come up through the wheel and fold

30
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:17,510
they come up through the wheel and fold

31
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:19,480
they come up through the wheel and fold
down flat again and so in this example

32
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:19,490
down flat again and so in this example

33
00:01:19,490 --> 00:01:22,300
down flat again and so in this example
this is what the hub looks like these

34
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:22,310
this is what the hub looks like these

35
00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:24,520
this is what the hub looks like these
are the two little flaps and then this

36
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:24,530
are the two little flaps and then this

37
00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:26,740
are the two little flaps and then this
blue piece has been stuck on to hold it

38
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:26,750
blue piece has been stuck on to hold it

39
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:29,320
blue piece has been stuck on to hold it
steady just to hold it all down as it

40
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:29,330
steady just to hold it all down as it

41
00:01:29,330 --> 00:01:31,240
steady just to hold it all down as it
moves there's a tendency for the flaps

42
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:31,250
moves there's a tendency for the flaps

43
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:33,130
moves there's a tendency for the flaps
to lift up a bit so it can be quite good

44
00:01:33,130 --> 00:01:33,140
to lift up a bit so it can be quite good

45
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:35,649
to lift up a bit so it can be quite good
to reinforce it so I'll just put this on

46
00:01:35,649 --> 00:01:35,659
to reinforce it so I'll just put this on

47
00:01:35,659 --> 00:01:38,469
to reinforce it so I'll just put this on
together so you can see easily how it

48
00:01:38,469 --> 00:01:38,479
together so you can see easily how it

49
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:40,420
together so you can see easily how it
works and then I'll show you some

50
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:40,430
works and then I'll show you some

51
00:01:40,430 --> 00:01:45,219
works and then I'll show you some
examples so when you put the glue on you

52
00:01:45,219 --> 00:01:45,229
examples so when you put the glue on you

53
00:01:45,229 --> 00:01:48,399
examples so when you put the glue on you
just put it onto the main body of the

54
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:48,409
just put it onto the main body of the

55
00:01:48,409 --> 00:01:52,539
just put it onto the main body of the
hub and again with all these pull strip

56
00:01:52,539 --> 00:01:52,549
hub and again with all these pull strip

57
00:01:52,549 --> 00:01:55,810
hub and again with all these pull strip
type mechanisms you don't want the glue

58
00:01:55,810 --> 00:01:55,820
type mechanisms you don't want the glue

59
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:58,120
type mechanisms you don't want the glue
oozing or it really gums up the works

60
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:58,130
oozing or it really gums up the works

61
00:01:58,130 --> 00:02:00,249
oozing or it really gums up the works
and stops them moving I've already

62
00:02:00,249 --> 00:02:00,259
and stops them moving I've already

63
00:02:00,259 --> 00:02:02,710
and stops them moving I've already
marked where this goes so the wheel will

64
00:02:02,710 --> 00:02:02,720
marked where this goes so the wheel will

65
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:04,870
marked where this goes so the wheel will
fit with this bite out of the base page

66
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:04,880
fit with this bite out of the base page

67
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:12,180
fit with this bite out of the base page
so it makes it easy to turn so there is

68
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:12,190


69
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:15,880
where the flaps are cut back to you

70
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:15,890
where the flaps are cut back to you

71
00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:18,610
where the flaps are cut back to you
don't want it too tight or too loose or

72
00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:18,620
don't want it too tight or too loose or

73
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:21,070
don't want it too tight or too loose or
the wheel just wobbles around so you

74
00:02:21,070 --> 00:02:21,080
the wheel just wobbles around so you

75
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:24,490
the wheel just wobbles around so you
need it fairly precise to fit within the

76
00:02:24,490 --> 00:02:24,500
need it fairly precise to fit within the

77
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:26,650
need it fairly precise to fit within the
wheel and here you can see so maybe

78
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:26,660
wheel and here you can see so maybe

79
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:29,559
wheel and here you can see so maybe
again if I put some marks on this you'll

80
00:02:29,559 --> 00:02:29,569
again if I put some marks on this you'll

81
00:02:29,569 --> 00:02:33,009
again if I put some marks on this you'll
be able to see how it moves more easily

82
00:02:33,009 --> 00:02:33,019
be able to see how it moves more easily

83
00:02:33,019 --> 00:02:37,210
be able to see how it moves more easily
so there is obviously just spins around

84
00:02:37,210 --> 00:02:37,220
so there is obviously just spins around

85
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:40,330
so there is obviously just spins around
quite easily and so I just look at some

86
00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:40,340
quite easily and so I just look at some

87
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:44,170
quite easily and so I just look at some
books there's Leon the chameleon by Nina

88
00:02:44,170 --> 00:02:44,180
books there's Leon the chameleon by Nina

89
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:47,440
books there's Leon the chameleon by Nina
can yak this is it there's a hub here

90
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:47,450
can yak this is it there's a hub here

91
00:02:47,450 --> 00:02:49,780
can yak this is it there's a hub here
behind the page which is enabling the

92
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:49,790
behind the page which is enabling the

93
00:02:49,790 --> 00:02:52,660
behind the page which is enabling the
color of the chameleon to change as you

94
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:52,670
color of the chameleon to change as you

95
00:02:52,670 --> 00:02:57,449
color of the chameleon to change as you
pull it around it just keeps moving on

96
00:02:57,449 --> 00:02:57,459
pull it around it just keeps moving on

97
00:02:57,459 --> 00:03:01,920
pull it around it just keeps moving on

the wheel is behind the page as you turn

118
00:03:35,289 --> 00:03:35,299
the wheel is behind the page as you turn

119
00:03:35,299 --> 00:03:38,800
the wheel is behind the page as you turn
it you get these optics so that's pretty

120
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:38,810
it you get these optics so that's pretty

121
00:03:38,810 --> 00:03:40,750
it you get these optics so that's pretty
good and then on the other side you've

122
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:40,760
good and then on the other side you've

123
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:43,780
good and then on the other side you've
got the same wheel as you turn it you

124
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:43,790
got the same wheel as you turn it you

125
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:52,339
got the same wheel as you turn it you
have the earth spinning in the window

126
00:03:52,339 --> 00:03:52,349


127
00:03:52,349 --> 00:03:54,869
the actual mechanism has a lot of

the actual mechanism has a lot of

129
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:56,729
the actual mechanism has a lot of
different uses so I'll just show you

130
00:03:56,729 --> 00:03:56,739
different uses so I'll just show you

131
00:03:56,739 --> 00:03:59,550
different uses so I'll just show you
some of those this is a really

132
00:03:59,550 --> 00:03:59,560
some of those this is a really

133
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:01,740
some of those this is a really
interesting useful mechanism as you pull

works
this is a basic pull strip that we did

142
00:04:09,690 --> 00:04:09,700
this is a basic pull strip that we did

143
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:12,599
this is a basic pull strip that we did
in tutorial 25 it has this additional

144
00:04:12,599 --> 00:04:12,609
in tutorial 25 it has this additional

145

flap on it the hub is a normal help just

147
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:18,509
flap on it the hub is a normal help just
like we made here but in this case it's

148
00:04:18,509 --> 00:04:18,519
like we made here but in this case it's

149
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:20,580
like we made here but in this case it's
not attached to the page the arms go

150
00:04:20,580 --> 00:04:20,590
not attached to the page the arms go

151
00:04:20,590 --> 00:04:22,800
not attached to the page the arms go
through the page and have the image

152
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:22,810
through the page and have the image

153
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:25,439
through the page and have the image
stuck onto them the other main body of

00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:29,760
the hub has this arm stuck on it again
make this double thickness because it

158
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:29,770
make this double thickness because it

159
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:32,310
make this double thickness because it
does take some stress that goes through

160
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:32,320
does take some stress that goes through

161
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:35,279
does take some stress that goes through
the hole in the flap as you put it the

162
00:04:35,279 --> 00:04:35,289
the hole in the flap as you put it the

163
00:04:35,289 --> 00:04:37,529
the hole in the flap as you put it the
amount of movement is governed by this

164
00:04:37,529 --> 00:04:37,539
amount of movement is governed by this

165
00:04:37,539 --> 00:04:39,659
amount of movement is governed by this
sleeve that controls the direction and

166
00:04:39,659 --> 00:04:39,669
sleeve that controls the direction and

167
00:04:39,669 --> 00:04:42,420
sleeve that controls the direction and
this slit that controls the direction so

168
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:42,430
this slit that controls the direction so

169
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:43,950
this slit that controls the direction so
those two control the direction of the

170
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:43,960
those two control the direction of the

171
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:46,409
those two control the direction of the
pull strip they also control the amount

172
00:04:46,409 --> 00:04:46,419
pull strip they also control the amount

173
00:04:46,419 --> 00:04:49,740
pull strip they also control the amount
of movement and here's another example

174
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:49,750
of movement and here's another example

175
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:53,339
of movement and here's another example
it's just a different image rotating on

176
00:04:53,339 --> 00:04:53,349
it's just a different image rotating on

177
00:04:53,349 --> 00:04:56,129
it's just a different image rotating on
the page it's the same thing you can see

178
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:56,139
the page it's the same thing you can see

179
00:04:56,139 --> 00:04:59,189
the page it's the same thing you can see
there's the pull strip moving the arm on

180
00:04:59,189 --> 00:04:59,199
there's the pull strip moving the arm on

181
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:01,409
there's the pull strip moving the arm on
the hub in this case the hub has been

182
00:05:01,409 --> 00:05:01,419
the hub in this case the hub has been

183
00:05:01,419 --> 00:05:04,589
the hub in this case the hub has been
made with its arm it's all one piece the

184
00:05:04,589 --> 00:05:04,599
made with its arm it's all one piece the

185
00:05:04,599 --> 00:05:06,089
made with its arm it's all one piece the
other thing to remember with these to

186
00:05:06,089 --> 00:05:06,099
other thing to remember with these to

187
00:05:06,099 --> 00:05:07,920
other thing to remember with these to
get the maximum movement you need the

188
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:07,930
get the maximum movement you need the

189
00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:10,200
get the maximum movement you need the
pull strip to be as close to the hub as

190
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:10,210
pull strip to be as close to the hub as

191
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:12,420
pull strip to be as close to the hub as
possible the further away it is from the

192
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:12,430
possible the further away it is from the

193
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:15,270
possible the further away it is from the
hub the less movement you'll get so keep

194
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:15,280
hub the less movement you'll get so keep

195
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:16,589
hub the less movement you'll get so keep
it as close as you can when you're

196
00:05:16,589 --> 00:05:16,599
it as close as you can when you're

197
00:05:16,599 --> 00:05:21,379
it as close as you can when you're
making one of these this I think is just

198
00:05:21,379 --> 00:05:21,389
making one of these this I think is just

199
00:05:21,389 --> 00:05:23,909
making one of these this I think is just
yeah this is just that just shows you

200
00:05:23,909 --> 00:05:23,919
yeah this is just that just shows you

201
00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:26,310
yeah this is just that just shows you
how you can really just budge it up you

202
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:26,320
how you can really just budge it up you

203
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:29,010
how you can really just budge it up you
know this is the governor that controls

204
00:05:29,010 --> 00:05:29,020
know this is the governor that controls

205
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:30,659
know this is the governor that controls
the amount of movement it's just a piece

206
00:05:30,659 --> 00:05:30,669
the amount of movement it's just a piece

207
00:05:30,669 --> 00:05:33,149
the amount of movement it's just a piece
being stuck onto the pull strip to stop

208
00:05:33,149 --> 00:05:33,159
being stuck onto the pull strip to stop

209
00:05:33,159 --> 00:05:35,670
being stuck onto the pull strip to stop
it moving any further it's as much to

210
00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:35,680
it moving any further it's as much to

211
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:38,610
it moving any further it's as much to
stop this end of the pull strip pulling

212
00:05:38,610 --> 00:05:38,620
stop this end of the pull strip pulling

213
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:43,800
stop this end of the pull strip pulling
out from the sleeve there no images just

214
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:43,810
out from the sleeve there no images just

215
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:50,119
out from the sleeve there no images just
as the piece moving

216
00:05:50,119 --> 00:05:50,129


217
00:05:50,129 --> 00:05:53,010
the hub can also be used to articulate

218
00:05:53,010 --> 00:05:53,020
the hub can also be used to articulate

219
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:57,119
the hub can also be used to articulate
movement so here's one the mechanism is

220
00:05:57,119 --> 00:05:57,129
movement so here's one the mechanism is

221
00:05:57,129 --> 00:05:58,499
movement so here's one the mechanism is
the same as what we've just looked at

222
00:05:58,499 --> 00:05:58,509
the same as what we've just looked at

223
00:05:58,509 --> 00:06:00,149
the same as what we've just looked at
there's the hub with the arms going

224
00:06:00,149 --> 00:06:00,159
there's the hub with the arms going

225
00:06:00,159 --> 00:06:02,460
there's the hub with the arms going
through the page and it's got an arm

226
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:02,470
through the page and it's got an arm

227
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:04,170
through the page and it's got an arm
attached to it going through this flap

228
00:06:04,170 --> 00:06:04,180
attached to it going through this flap

229
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:06,869
attached to it going through this flap
on the pull strip so as you pull it it's

230
00:06:06,869 --> 00:06:06,879
on the pull strip so as you pull it it's

231
00:06:06,879 --> 00:06:08,969
on the pull strip so as you pull it it's
exactly the same as what we looked at

232
00:06:08,969 --> 00:06:08,979
exactly the same as what we looked at

233
00:06:08,979 --> 00:06:11,670
exactly the same as what we looked at
just now on the other side you've got a

234
00:06:11,670 --> 00:06:11,680
just now on the other side you've got a

235
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:14,279
just now on the other side you've got a
chain this is where there's a hub behind

236
00:06:14,279 --> 00:06:14,289
chain this is where there's a hub behind

237
00:06:14,289 --> 00:06:16,559
chain this is where there's a hub behind
here which is what's being moved by the

238
00:06:16,559 --> 00:06:16,569
here which is what's being moved by the

239
00:06:16,569 --> 00:06:19,140
here which is what's being moved by the
pool strip there's one here which is

240
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:19,150
pool strip there's one here which is

241
00:06:19,150 --> 00:06:21,870
pool strip there's one here which is
attached to the page and then these two

242
00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:21,880
attached to the page and then these two

243
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:24,390
attached to the page and then these two
are linking the three pieces of cards as

244
00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:24,400
are linking the three pieces of cards as

245
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,980
are linking the three pieces of cards as
you pull it the whole thing is

246
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:25,990
you pull it the whole thing is

247
00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:28,950
you pull it the whole thing is
articulated you can only use three if

248
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:28,960
articulated you can only use three if

249
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,540
articulated you can only use three if
you have just two arms then it's

250
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:30,550
you have just two arms then it's

251
00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:32,580
you have just two arms then it's
triangulated it's just rigid it won't

252
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:32,590
triangulated it's just rigid it won't

253
00:06:32,590 --> 00:06:35,100
triangulated it's just rigid it won't
move if you have more than three then

254
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:35,110
move if you have more than three then

255
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:37,230
move if you have more than three then
it's a chain so one end or move but the

256
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:37,240
it's a chain so one end or move but the

257
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:39,480
it's a chain so one end or move but the
other end just thought it doesn't do

258
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:39,490
other end just thought it doesn't do

259
00:06:39,490 --> 00:06:40,980
other end just thought it doesn't do
anything they'll just sort of move

260
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:40,990
anything they'll just sort of move

261
00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:43,260
anything they'll just sort of move
around and this is very clear what it's

262
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:43,270
around and this is very clear what it's

263
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:45,510
around and this is very clear what it's
doing and there's two good examples one

264
00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:45,520
doing and there's two good examples one

265
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:49,469
doing and there's two good examples one
is in robot by NP and Kowski has a

266
00:06:49,469 --> 00:06:49,479
is in robot by NP and Kowski has a

267
00:06:49,479 --> 00:06:51,149
is in robot by NP and Kowski has a
really nice example of an articulated

268
00:06:51,149 --> 00:06:51,159
really nice example of an articulated

269
00:06:51,159 --> 00:06:54,029
really nice example of an articulated
image so it's the the mum robot dumping

270
00:06:54,029 --> 00:06:54,039
image so it's the the mum robot dumping

271
00:06:54,039 --> 00:06:56,189
image so it's the the mum robot dumping
the baby robot in the washing machine as

272
00:06:56,189 --> 00:06:56,199
the baby robot in the washing machine as

273
00:06:56,199 --> 00:06:58,920
the baby robot in the washing machine as
you pull the strip down goes the baby

274
00:06:58,920 --> 00:06:58,930
you pull the strip down goes the baby

275
00:06:58,930 --> 00:07:02,159
you pull the strip down goes the baby
and so again this is three pieces one is

276
00:07:02,159 --> 00:07:02,169
and so again this is three pieces one is

277
00:07:02,169 --> 00:07:03,689
and so again this is three pieces one is
attached to the pull strip one is

278
00:07:03,689 --> 00:07:03,699
attached to the pull strip one is

279
00:07:03,699 --> 00:07:05,370
attached to the pull strip one is
attached to the page and the other two

280
00:07:05,370 --> 00:07:05,380
attached to the page and the other two

281
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:08,100
attached to the page and the other two
are attached to the baby and if we look

282
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:08,110
are attached to the baby and if we look

283
00:07:08,110 --> 00:07:10,379
are attached to the baby and if we look
at it from behind you can see there are

284
00:07:10,379 --> 00:07:10,389
at it from behind you can see there are

285
00:07:10,389 --> 00:07:12,930
at it from behind you can see there are
the two hubs that holds the three pieces

286
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:12,940
the two hubs that holds the three pieces

287
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:17,269
the two hubs that holds the three pieces
together and there's another example

288
00:07:17,269 --> 00:07:17,279
together and there's another example

289
00:07:17,279 --> 00:07:20,339
together and there's another example

00:07:24,490 --> 00:07:27,240
David Pellom here is it's this dragon as
you pull the strip the dragon is

294
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:27,250
you pull the strip the dragon is

295
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:29,490
you pull the strip the dragon is
articulated so it's working in a

296
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:29,500
articulated so it's working in a

297
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:31,890
articulated so it's working in a
different way but you can see the pull

298
00:07:31,890 --> 00:07:31,900
different way but you can see the pull

299
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:33,570
different way but you can see the pull
strip will be attached to the middle

300
00:07:33,570 --> 00:07:33,580
strip will be attached to the middle

301
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:36,300

piece here and then these two hubs

302
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:36,310
piece here and then these two hubs

303
00:07:36,310 --> 00:07:37,950
piece here and then these two hubs
attaching them to the page so the whole

304
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:37,960
attaching them to the page so the whole

305
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:40,320
attaching them to the page so the whole
thing can just just move around as you

306
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:40,330
thing can just just move around as you

307
00:07:40,330 --> 00:07:45,150

hub the hub is attached to the page and
then these two arms come up and go

326
00:08:13,090 --> 00:08:13,100
then these two arms come up and go

327
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:15,220
then these two arms come up and go
through the hole in this purple piece

328
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:15,230
through the hole in this purple piece

329
00:08:15,230 --> 00:08:17,800
through the hole in this purple piece
the purple piece you have to do it with

330
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:17,810
the purple piece you have to do it with

331
00:08:17,810 --> 00:08:20,530
the purple piece you have to do it with
a compass so there's three circles one

332
00:08:20,530 --> 00:08:20,540
a compass so there's three circles one

333
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:23,770
a compass so there's three circles one
here and then one here and one here so

334
00:08:23,770 --> 00:08:23,780
here and then one here and one here so

335
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:25,780
here and then one here and one here so
this slit that the whole thing appears

336
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:25,790
this slit that the whole thing appears

337
00:08:25,790 --> 00:08:28,510
this slit that the whole thing appears
through that is aiming at the center of

338
00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:28,520
through that is aiming at the center of

339
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:31,480
through that is aiming at the center of
all these circles so it just moves

340
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:31,490
all these circles so it just moves

341
00:08:31,490 --> 00:08:34,480
all these circles so it just moves
through it quite smoothly so this bit

342
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:34,490
through it quite smoothly so this bit

343
00:08:34,490 --> 00:08:36,280
through it quite smoothly so this bit
takes quite a lot of stress it needs to

344
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:36,290
takes quite a lot of stress it needs to

345
00:08:36,290 --> 00:08:37,960
takes quite a lot of stress it needs to
be quite broad or it'll tend to buckle

346
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:37,970
be quite broad or it'll tend to buckle

347
00:08:37,970 --> 00:08:40,390
be quite broad or it'll tend to buckle
and this arm as well needs to be double

348
00:08:40,390 --> 00:08:40,400
and this arm as well needs to be double

349
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:42,790
and this arm as well needs to be double
thickness or again it'll tend to buckle

350
00:08:42,790 --> 00:08:42,800
thickness or again it'll tend to buckle

351
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:44,230
thickness or again it'll tend to buckle
because it does take quite a lot of

352
00:08:44,230 --> 00:08:44,240
because it does take quite a lot of

353
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,780
because it does take quite a lot of
stress again a very pleasing mechanism

354
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:46,790
stress again a very pleasing mechanism

355
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:48,970
stress again a very pleasing mechanism
and you can always put a image on the

356
00:08:48,970 --> 00:08:48,980
and you can always put a image on the

357
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:50,920
and you can always put a image on the
end here so you have an image swooping

358
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:50,930
end here so you have an image swooping

359
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:53,410
end here so you have an image swooping
