based on moving arms so now to show you
how to make one of these this is an

48
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:48,110
how to make one of these this is an

49
00:01:48,110 --> 00:01:50,289
how to make one of these this is an
example this is based on the parallel

50
00:01:50,289 --> 00:01:50,299
example this is based on the parallel

51
00:01:50,299 --> 00:01:53,320
example this is based on the parallel
fold which is tutorial 5 and so here's

52
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:53,330
fold which is tutorial 5 and so here's

53
00:01:53,330 --> 00:01:55,539
fold which is tutorial 5 and so here's
the parallel fold with a little counter

54
00:01:55,539 --> 00:01:55,549
the parallel fold with a little counter

55
00:01:55,549 --> 00:01:58,210
the parallel fold with a little counter
fold folded into the corner up here and

56
00:01:58,210 --> 00:01:58,220
fold folded into the corner up here and

57
00:01:58,220 --> 00:02:00,399
fold folded into the corner up here and
then you have this l-shaped piece and

58
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:00,409
then you have this l-shaped piece and

59
00:02:00,409 --> 00:02:02,370
then you have this l-shaped piece and
that's what the wheel is stuck to the

60
00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:02,380
that's what the wheel is stuck to the

61
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:06,039
that's what the wheel is stuck to the
key thing is there's a crease across one

62
00:02:06,039 --> 00:02:06,049
key thing is there's a crease across one

63
00:02:06,049 --> 00:02:09,249
key thing is there's a crease across one
arm of the L so that this piece can bend

64
00:02:09,249 --> 00:02:09,259
arm of the L so that this piece can bend

65
00:02:09,259 --> 00:02:12,160
arm of the L so that this piece can bend
up and down and then the other crucial

66
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:12,170
up and down and then the other crucial

67
00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:14,080
up and down and then the other crucial
thing is the center of the wheel

68
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:14,090
thing is the center of the wheel

69
00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:17,080
thing is the center of the wheel
goes right on this point so the inner

70
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:17,090
goes right on this point so the inner

71
00:02:17,090 --> 00:02:20,080
goes right on this point so the inner
corner of the l-shape goes where all the

72
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:20,090
corner of the l-shape goes where all the

73
00:02:20,090 --> 00:02:22,630
corner of the l-shape goes where all the
creases meet and then the center of the

74
00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:22,640
creases meet and then the center of the

75
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:25,510
creases meet and then the center of the
wheel goes on that point so I'll just

76
00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:25,520
wheel goes on that point so I'll just

77
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,240
wheel goes on that point so I'll just
make you one

78
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:27,250
make you one

79
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:30,100
make you one
so here I've prepared the bits and

80
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:30,110
so here I've prepared the bits and

81
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:32,550
so here I've prepared the bits and
pieces we've got another base sheet

82
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:32,560
pieces we've got another base sheet

83
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:37,449
pieces we've got another base sheet
here's the parallelogram piece so I'll

84
00:02:37,449 --> 00:02:37,459
here's the parallelogram piece so I'll

85
00:02:37,459 --> 00:02:39,880
here's the parallelogram piece so I'll
start by sticking the parallelogram on

86
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:39,890
start by sticking the parallelogram on

87
00:02:39,890 --> 00:02:42,940
start by sticking the parallelogram on
and we need to measure that so put the

88
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:42,950
and we need to measure that so put the

89
00:02:42,950 --> 00:02:44,860
and we need to measure that so put the
central crease of the parallelogram

90
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:44,870
central crease of the parallelogram

91
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:48,060
central crease of the parallelogram
piece onto the central gully of the base

92
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:48,070
piece onto the central gully of the base

93
00:02:48,070 --> 00:02:53,410
piece onto the central gully of the base
mark where one of the creases lies there

94
00:02:53,410 --> 00:02:53,420
mark where one of the creases lies there

95
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:56,979
mark where one of the creases lies there
is flip the whole thing over so I've

96
00:02:56,979 --> 00:02:56,989
is flip the whole thing over so I've

97
00:02:56,989 --> 00:02:58,870
is flip the whole thing over so I've
marked the short side and now the long

98
00:02:58,870 --> 00:02:58,880
marked the short side and now the long

99
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:07,990
marked the short side and now the long
side is going to stick to that with

100
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:08,000
side is going to stick to that with

101
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,259
side is going to stick to that with
parallelograms when the base is flat the

102
00:03:11,259 --> 00:03:11,269
parallelograms when the base is flat the

103
00:03:11,269 --> 00:03:13,210
parallelograms when the base is flat the
whole parallelogram is flat so we can

104
00:03:13,210 --> 00:03:13,220
whole parallelogram is flat so we can

105
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:15,070
whole parallelogram is flat so we can
keep it flat and just put glue on the

106
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:15,080
keep it flat and just put glue on the

107
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:24,430
keep it flat and just put glue on the
other tab here and glue that down make

108
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:24,440
other tab here and glue that down make

109
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:27,640
other tab here and glue that down make
sure it's actually working all right I

110
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:27,650
sure it's actually working all right I

111
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:29,530
sure it's actually working all right I
haven't put too much glue on or anything

112
00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:29,540
haven't put too much glue on or anything

113
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:32,800
haven't put too much glue on or anything
like that now I've got this piece this

114
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:32,810
like that now I've got this piece this

115
00:03:32,810 --> 00:03:35,530
like that now I've got this piece this
is the l-shaped piece that's going to

116
00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:35,540
is the l-shaped piece that's going to

117
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:41,860
is the l-shaped piece that's going to
stick on like that so that needs this

118
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:41,870
stick on like that so that needs this

119
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:44,319
stick on like that so that needs this
the dotted line that's where the crease

120
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:44,329
the dotted line that's where the crease

121
00:03:44,329 --> 00:03:46,870
the dotted line that's where the crease
is so I'll just do that by eye no need

122
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:46,880
is so I'll just do that by eye no need

123
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:51,250
is so I'll just do that by eye no need
to measure it or anything that top

124
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:51,260
to measure it or anything that top

125
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:54,610
to measure it or anything that top
sticks on to there bit fiddly this I

126
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:54,620
sticks on to there bit fiddly this I

127
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:56,289
sticks on to there bit fiddly this I
have seen some books where the whole

128
00:03:56,289 --> 00:03:56,299
have seen some books where the whole

129
00:03:56,299 --> 00:03:59,289
have seen some books where the whole
piece is made out of one piece of card

130
00:03:59,289 --> 00:03:59,299
piece is made out of one piece of card

131
00:03:59,299 --> 00:04:05,349
piece is made out of one piece of card
folded over and glued down so that glues

132
00:04:05,349 --> 00:04:05,359
folded over and glued down so that glues

133
00:04:05,359 --> 00:04:09,250
folded over and glued down so that glues
on there making sure the inner angle of

134
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:09,260
on there making sure the inner angle of

135
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:11,319
on there making sure the inner angle of
this l-shaped piece is right on where

136
00:04:11,319 --> 00:04:11,329
this l-shaped piece is right on where

137
00:04:11,329 --> 00:04:15,099
this l-shaped piece is right on where
all the blood converge and then you need

138
00:04:15,099 --> 00:04:15,109
all the blood converge and then you need

139
00:04:15,109 --> 00:04:18,580
all the blood converge and then you need
to get this central point of the circle

140
00:04:18,580 --> 00:04:18,590
to get this central point of the circle

141
00:04:18,590 --> 00:04:23,279
to get this central point of the circle
right on that same point

142
00:04:23,279 --> 00:04:23,289


143
00:04:23,289 --> 00:04:26,770
so this is already starting to move but

144
00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:26,780
so this is already starting to move but

145
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:28,650
so this is already starting to move but
as you see because it's on one of these

146
00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:28,660
as you see because it's on one of these

147
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:31,629
as you see because it's on one of these
angled pieces the circle will tend to

148
00:04:31,629 --> 00:04:31,639
angled pieces the circle will tend to

149
00:04:31,639 --> 00:04:33,969
angled pieces the circle will tend to
lift up at an angle so you've got two

150
00:04:33,969 --> 00:04:33,979
lift up at an angle so you've got two

151
00:04:33,979 --> 00:04:35,890
lift up at an angle so you've got two
choices you can either like this one

152
00:04:35,890 --> 00:04:35,900
choices you can either like this one

153
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:38,020
choices you can either like this one
have a piece stuck onto the

154
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:38,030
have a piece stuck onto the

155
00:04:38,030 --> 00:04:40,540
have a piece stuck onto the
parallelogram that goes behind the

156
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:40,550
parallelogram that goes behind the

157
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:44,740
parallelogram that goes behind the
circle like this that goes on here and

158
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:44,750
circle like this that goes on here and

159
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:48,040
circle like this that goes on here and
that actually holds the circle up the

160
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:48,050
that actually holds the circle up the

161
00:04:48,050 --> 00:04:49,330
that actually holds the circle up the
other way you can do is have a piece

162
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:49,340
other way you can do is have a piece

163
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:51,309
other way you can do is have a piece
below it so you can stick it on down

164
00:04:51,309 --> 00:04:51,319
below it so you can stick it on down

165
00:04:51,319 --> 00:04:53,379
below it so you can stick it on down
here and that holds left bottom of the

166
00:04:53,379 --> 00:04:53,389
here and that holds left bottom of the

167
00:04:53,389 --> 00:04:55,899
here and that holds left bottom of the
circle down so I think I'll just do one

168
00:04:55,899 --> 00:04:55,909
circle down so I think I'll just do one

169
00:04:55,909 --> 00:04:59,950
circle down so I think I'll just do one
of those in this case cut a piece off

170
00:04:59,950 --> 00:04:59,960
of those in this case cut a piece off

171
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:03,969
of those in this case cut a piece off
make this a bit better size and just put

172
00:05:03,969 --> 00:05:03,979
make this a bit better size and just put

173
00:05:03,979 --> 00:05:16,420
make this a bit better size and just put
a bit of glue on here glue that down so

174
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:16,430
a bit of glue on here glue that down so

175
00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:18,909
a bit of glue on here glue that down so
this one would be improved if this extra

176
00:05:18,909 --> 00:05:18,919
this one would be improved if this extra

177
00:05:18,919 --> 00:05:21,100
this one would be improved if this extra

lifting up the parallelogram its lifting

185
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:29,589
lifting up the parallelogram its lifting
up this plane whereas if this came down

186
00:05:29,589 --> 00:05:29,599
up this plane whereas if this came down

187
00:05:29,599 --> 00:05:31,510
up this plane whereas if this came down
and joined the page that would just hold

188
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:31,520
and joined the page that would just hold

189
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:34,120
and joined the page that would just hold
it up flat and you get a nicely turning

190
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:34,130
it up flat and you get a nicely turning

191
00:05:34,130 --> 00:05:37,209

William if I just add a few marks on

192
00:05:37,209 --> 00:05:37,219
William if I just add a few marks on

193
00:05:37,219 --> 00:05:39,909
William if I just add a few marks on
there you'll be able to see that it is

194
00:05:39,909 --> 00:05:39,919
there you'll be able to see that it is

195
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:44,200
there you'll be able to see that it is
actually turning so as I turn it you see

196
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:44,210
actually turning so as I turn it you see

197
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:46,749
actually turning so as I turn it you see
that it does have that turning movement

198
00:05:46,749 --> 00:05:46,759
that it does have that turning movement

199
00:05:46,759 --> 00:05:49,060
that it does have that turning movement
you can see because it isn't attached to

200
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:49,070
you can see because it isn't attached to

201
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:52,089
you can see because it isn't attached to
the base it actually the wheel pushes it

202
00:05:52,089 --> 00:05:52,099
the base it actually the wheel pushes it

203
00:05:52,099 --> 00:05:57,370

up if you look at this one this piece is

204
00:05:57,370 --> 00:05:57,380
up if you look at this one this piece is

205
00:05:57,380 --> 00:05:59,140
up if you look at this one this piece is
actually another parallelogram so it

206
00:05:59,140 --> 00:05:59,150
actually another parallelogram so it

207
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:03,070
actually another parallelogram so it
comes down and joins the page and you

208
00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:03,080
comes down and joins the page and you

209
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:05,110
comes down and joins the page and you
see when it's closed it sticks out that

210
00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:05,120
see when it's closed it sticks out that

211
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,420
see when it's closed it sticks out that
far that I can't actually fix it onto

212
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:07,430
far that I can't actually fix it onto

213
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:09,040
far that I can't actually fix it onto
that way so I'm just going to pull that

214
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:09,050
that way so I'm just going to pull that

215
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:13,029
that way so I'm just going to pull that
off it's pop ups quite a forgiving

216
00:06:13,029 --> 00:06:13,039
off it's pop ups quite a forgiving

217
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:15,730
off it's pop ups quite a forgiving
medium really you can chop and change as

218
00:06:15,730 --> 00:06:15,740
medium really you can chop and change as

219
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:18,399
medium really you can chop and change as
you go along I've got a piece that's

220
00:06:18,399 --> 00:06:18,409
you go along I've got a piece that's

221
00:06:18,409 --> 00:06:21,459
you go along I've got a piece that's
it's been cut to the right dimension so

222
00:06:21,459 --> 00:06:21,469
it's been cut to the right dimension so

223
00:06:21,469 --> 00:06:23,170
it's been cut to the right dimension so
I can make a proper parallelogram that

224
00:06:23,170 --> 00:06:23,180
I can make a proper parallelogram that

225
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:25,470
I can make a proper parallelogram that
will stick down behind the wheel

226
00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:25,480
will stick down behind the wheel

227
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:27,690
will stick down behind the wheel
and that'll hold it into position so

228
00:06:27,690 --> 00:06:27,700
and that'll hold it into position so

229
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:29,700
and that'll hold it into position so
being a parallelogram you can stick the

230
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:29,710
being a parallelogram you can stick the

231
00:06:29,710 --> 00:06:32,460
being a parallelogram you can stick the
whole thing down flat and then I put

232
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:32,470
whole thing down flat and then I put

233
00:06:32,470 --> 00:06:37,100
whole thing down flat and then I put
some glue on this parallelograms tab and

234
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:37,110
some glue on this parallelograms tab and

235
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:41,760
some glue on this parallelograms tab and
smooth other bits and put it all flat

236
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:41,770
smooth other bits and put it all flat

237
00:06:41,770 --> 00:06:43,830
smooth other bits and put it all flat
goes underneath the wheel if it's at the

238
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:43,840
goes underneath the wheel if it's at the

239
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:51,890
goes underneath the wheel if it's at the
top stick it down let's hope it works

240
00:06:51,890 --> 00:06:51,900
top stick it down let's hope it works

241
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:55,800
top stick it down let's hope it works
yeah there we go there's the turning

242
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:55,810
yeah there we go there's the turning

243
00:06:55,810 --> 00:06:58,950
yeah there we go there's the turning
wheel as a turning way they say okay and

244
00:06:58,950 --> 00:06:58,960
wheel as a turning way they say okay and

245
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:01,380
wheel as a turning way they say okay and
you can see it can be used to make cars

246
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:01,390
you can see it can be used to make cars

247
00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:02,640
you can see it can be used to make cars
and things but it's actually more

248
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:02,650
and things but it's actually more

249
00:07:02,650 --> 00:07:05,400
and things but it's actually more

like the newspaper turning heads turning

252
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:07,930
like the newspaper turning heads turning

253
00:07:07,930 --> 00:07:09,900
like the newspaper turning heads turning
things like that there's one other book

254
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:09,910
things like that there's one other book

255
00:07:09,910 --> 00:07:12,620
things like that there's one other book
that's got really good examples it's

256

the hand on the clock is made to move

262
00:07:21,330 --> 00:07:21,340
the hand on the clock is made to move

263
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:22,950

that is using the turning wheel

264
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:22,960
that is using the turning wheel

265
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:25,320
that is using the turning wheel
mechanism but if we look under here

266
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:25,330
mechanism but if we look under here

267
00:07:25,330 --> 00:07:28,380
mechanism but if we look under here
there's a whole array of wheels for

268
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:28,390
there's a whole array of wheels for

269
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:33,300
there's a whole array of wheels for
turning in different directions so

270
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:33,310
turning in different directions so

271
00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:35,880
turning in different directions so
turning wheels quite a complicated

272
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:35,890
turning wheels quite a complicated

273
00:07:35,890 --> 00:07:39,090
turning wheels quite a complicated

earlier book can pop up a manual of

276
00:07:41,850 --> 00:07:41,860
earlier book can pop up a manual of

277
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:43,920
earlier book can pop up a manual of
paper mechanisms and actually out of

278
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:43,930
paper mechanisms and actually out of

279
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:45,630
paper mechanisms and actually out of
print but I think it's possible to get

280
00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:45,640
print but I think it's possible to get

281
00:07:45,640 --> 00:08:16,060
print but I think it's possible to get
secondhand versions
