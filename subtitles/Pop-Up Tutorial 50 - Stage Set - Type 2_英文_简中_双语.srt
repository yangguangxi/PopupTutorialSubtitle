您拉动测量的两个位是

16
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:56,090
the tabs bit more simple inside and then
有点复杂，因为碎片

20
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:04,760
how it all works is you pull the tabs
整个正面和两个墙头

21
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:08,320
how it all works is you pull the tabs
and it opens up its two main pieces one
这些位，因为它们填补了空白

22
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:08,330
and it opens up its two main pieces one
他们需要是差距的一半

23
00:01:08,330 --> 00:01:11,560
and it opens up its two main pieces one
is the frame and then the other side is
所以我已经提前做好了

24
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:11,570
is the frame and then the other side is
所有的测量都标记在

25
00:01:11,570 --> 00:01:14,050
is the frame and then the other side is
really one long strip this is the back
它，所以您可以看到它们是什么

26
00:01:14,050 --> 00:01:14,060
really one long strip this is the back
主要的正面这是一半

27
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:15,910
really one long strip this is the back
of the scene the two sides and then the
a4卡的21厘米宽

28
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:15,920
of the scene the two sides and then the
高度是a4的一半

29
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:18,609
of the scene the two sides and then the
two bits that you pull the measuring is
重要的是这个窗口，所以

30
00:01:18,609 --> 00:01:18,619
two bits that you pull the measuring is
十厘米乘八厘米

31
00:01:18,619 --> 00:01:21,010
two bits that you pull the measuring is
slightly complicated because the pieces
这是背面的一块

32
00:01:21,010 --> 00:01:21,020
slightly complicated because the pieces
您正在寻找的房间

33
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:23,920
slightly complicated because the pieces
that you pull because they come in like
那是10 x 10，就像你看到的那样

34
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:23,930
that you pull because they come in like
它的宽度与

35
00:01:23,930 --> 00:01:26,859
that you pull because they come in like
this they need to be each of those pulls
窗户，但比

36
00:01:26,859 --> 00:01:26,869
this they need to be each of those pulls
整体

37
00:01:26,869 --> 00:01:29,380
this they need to be each of those pulls
pieces has to be half the size of the
窗户，然后这是两个方面

38
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:29,390
pieces has to be half the size of the
会粘在一起的碎片，如果

39
00:01:29,390 --> 00:01:33,789
pieces has to be half the size of the
whole frontage and the two wall bits
我们看看整个长片

40
00:01:33,789 --> 00:01:33,799
whole frontage and the two wall bits
两侧背面和两个位

41
00:01:33,799 --> 00:01:37,030
whole frontage and the two wall bits
these bits because they fill in the gap
你拉，你会看到双方都有

42
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:37,040
these bits because they fill in the gap
这些插槽切入它们，然后

43
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:39,550
these bits because they fill in the gap
they need to be half the size of the gap
图像在穿过

44
00:01:39,550 --> 00:01:39,560
they need to be half the size of the gap
插槽，这是我的几个酒吧

45
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:42,940
they need to be half the size of the gap
so I've made all the pieces in advance
剪掉这些是

46
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:42,950
so I've made all the pieces in advance
贴在房间的后面，这样

47
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:44,679
so I've made all the pieces in advance
with all the measurements marked up on
这将是房间的后面

48
00:01:44,679 --> 00:01:44,689
with all the measurements marked up on
会像这样坚持下去

49
00:01:44,689 --> 00:01:47,050
with all the measurements marked up on
it so you can see what they are this is
是整件的尺寸

50
00:01:47,050 --> 00:01:47,060
it so you can see what they are this is
跨21个，所以每个必须是十个

51
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:49,959
it so you can see what they are this is
the main frontage this is half a piece
半然后宽度

52
00:01:49,959 --> 00:01:49,969
the main frontage this is half a piece
窗口是十，所以这些必须是一半

53
00:01:49,969 --> 00:01:53,830
the main frontage this is half a piece
of a4 card the 21 centimetres across and
其中有五个，所以当

54
00:01:53,830 --> 00:01:53,840
of a4 card the 21 centimetres across and
这样就可以了

55
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:56,080
of a4 card the 21 centimetres across and
the height is half a sheet of a4 the
酒吧有这些插槽

56
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:56,090
the height is half a sheet of a4 the
通过最靠近前面的那一个

57
00:01:56,090 --> 00:01:58,929
the height is half a sheet of a4 the
important thing is this window so that's
将会是一个半的窗口

58
00:01:58,929 --> 00:01:58,939
important thing is this window so that's
从底部和

59
00:01:58,939 --> 00:02:02,370
important thing is this window so that's
ten centimetres by eight centimetres
它后面的一个将是两个半

60
00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:02,380
ten centimetres by eight centimetres
厘米高，他们都是两个

61
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:04,749
ten centimetres by eight centimetres
this is the piece that goes at the back
厘米深，它们是一个又一个

62
00:02:04,749 --> 00:02:04,759
this is the piece that goes at the back
距离边缘半厘米

63
00:02:04,759 --> 00:02:06,399
this is the piece that goes at the back
of the room that you're looking into so
他们去了其中两个

64
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:06,409

00:02:06,409 --> 00:02:09,160
of the room that you're looking into so
that's 10 by 10 as you can see it's a
只是把这些粘在一起，我会保持

66
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:09,170
that's 10 by 10 as you can see it's a
在您打开时测量

67
00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:11,770
that's 10 by 10 as you can see it's a
little bit it's the same width as the
整个卡片你不会看到所有的

68
00:02:11,770 --> 00:02:11,780
little bit it's the same width as the
测量我有一个房间，所以

69
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:14,230
little bit it's the same width as the
window but it's a little bit higher than
就像那样，我会坚持

70
00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:14,240
window but it's a little bit higher than
这些一起让我们放一些胶水

71
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:14,680
window but it's a little bit higher than
the whole
这个标签在这里我已经预先评分了

72
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:14,690
the whole
然后将其折叠并弄皱，就这样

73
00:02:14,690 --> 00:02:17,770
the whole
window and then these are the two side
会很好地移动，但是当你

74
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:17,780
window and then these are the two side
真正让自己不要忘记

75
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:20,740
window and then these are the two side
pieces that are going to glue on so if
真正压制所有折痕，所以它们

76
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:20,750
pieces that are going to glue on so if
他们移动得非常好，这样就可以了

77
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:23,260
pieces that are going to glue on so if
we look at how this whole long piece the
像这样的权利，所以一侧坚持

78
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:23,270
we look at how this whole long piece the
现在我要坚持另一面

79
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:25,210
we look at how this whole long piece the
two sides the back and the two bits that
到另一边才能做到这一点

80
00:02:25,210 --> 00:02:25,220
two sides the back and the two bits that
长条，所以放在那里

81
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:27,580
two sides the back and the two bits that
you pull you'll see that the sides have
标签在房间的后面

82
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:27,590
you pull you'll see that the sides have
正如我所说的，把胶水放在这里

83
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:30,700
you pull you'll see that the sides have
these slots cut in them and then the
始终粘合时使其光滑

84
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:30,710
these slots cut in them and then the
将胶水涂抹到折痕上，这样

85
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:34,000
these slots cut in them and then the
images are on bars that go through the
在那里

86
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:34,010
images are on bars that go through the
好圆，使它顺利进行

87
00:02:34,010 --> 00:02:36,760
images are on bars that go through the
slots here's a couple of bars that I've
所以这就是长片的样子

88
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:36,770
slots here's a couple of bars that I've
所以当它关闭时，它会像

89
00:02:36,770 --> 00:02:40,630
slots here's a couple of bars that I've
cut out these are the sides that will
所以现在我们必须将其添加到

90
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:40,640
cut out these are the sides that will
框架，我们有两个袖子

91
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:43,090
cut out these are the sides that will
stick on to the the back of the room so
所以我们有两个袖子

92
00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:43,100
stick on to the the back of the room so
你可以在后面的碎片

93
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:45,640
stick on to the the back of the room so
this will be the back of the room these
看到我没有给他们上色，但是

94
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:45,650
this will be the back of the room these
这里有一个袖子这里有一个袖子

95
00:02:45,650 --> 00:02:48,130
this will be the back of the room these
are going to stick on like this so these
他们是保持这些滑动的

96
00:02:48,130 --> 00:02:48,140
are going to stick on like this so these
零件就位，并使它们移动

97
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:51,820
are going to stick on like this so these
are the measurements the whole piece is
你想让他们移动的方式，所以我有

98
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:51,830
are the measurements the whole piece is
其中的两个只是一小部分

99
00:02:51,830 --> 00:02:55,540
are the measurements the whole piece is
21 across so each of these has to be ten
长于整个高度

100
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:55,550
21 across so each of these has to be ten
滑动片，所以它们是十点五

101
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:58,750
21 across so each of these has to be ten
and a half and then the width of the
厘米，它们将粘在上面

102
00:02:58,750 --> 00:02:58,760
and a half and then the width of the
这个的背面，所以我有

103
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:02,920
and a half and then the width of the
window is ten so these have to be half
此处的尺寸，但我会保留

104
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:02,930
window is ten so these have to be half
我要去背面测量

105
00:03:02,930 --> 00:03:05,740
window is ten so these have to be half
of that so these are five so when it's
坚持这些，他们就去

106
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:05,750
of that so these are five so when it's
冲在我涂胶的窗户上

107
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:08,740
of that so these are five so when it's
in position it'll be like that and then
两个标签1 2和这些像这样

108
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:08,750
in position it'll be like that and then
理想情况下，我会对其进行测量，以便

109
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:10,630
in position it'll be like that and then
it has these slots that the bars go
它们在上方完全等距

110
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:10,640
it has these slots that the bars go
在窗框下面，所以有一个是

111
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:13,900
it has these slots that the bars go
through the one nearest the front of the
另一个，只是确保

112
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:13,910
through the one nearest the front of the
褶皱也很好，但粘在那些上

113
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:16,120
through the one nearest the front of the
window that'll be one and a half
二

114
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:16,130
window that'll be one and a half
然后小心地粘上你

115
00:03:16,130 --> 00:03:19,240
window that'll be one and a half
centimeters high from the bottom and the
真的不希望它损失太多，

116
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:19,250
centimeters high from the bottom and the
粘上袖子就这样了

117
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:20,800
centimeters high from the bottom and the
one behind it will be two and a half
两个袖子齐平

118
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:20,810
one behind it will be two and a half
窗口的边缘现在我们

119
00:03:20,810 --> 00:03:22,930
one behind it will be two and a half
centimeters high they're both two
这一块，并通过所有

120
00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:22,940
centimeters high they're both two
它会像这样，所以放一个

121
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:26,380
centimeters high they're both two
centimeters deep and they're one and a
穿过那边，另一边

122
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:26,390
centimeters deep and they're one and a
通过那里，所以现在你可以看到它

123
00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:29,710
centimeters deep and they're one and a
half centimeters in from the edges so
关闭这些将出现在

124
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:29,720
half centimeters in from the edges so
尽管我的测量是如此微小

125
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:31,750
half centimeters in from the edges so
there are two of these pieces they go
关闭，因为还有一点

126
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:31,760
there are two of these pieces they go
缝隙，然后将其拉出

127
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:35,380
there are two of these pieces they go
one on each side of the back so now I'll
现在打开，我们将这些条放到位

128
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:35,390
one on each side of the back so now I'll
所以条的长度是十点

129
00:03:35,390 --> 00:03:37,780
one on each side of the back so now I'll
just stick these together I'll keep the
两个略长于

130
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:37,790
just stick these together I'll keep the
窗口的宽度和高度

131
00:03:37,790 --> 00:03:40,630
just stick these together I'll keep the
measurements out of you so when you open
的酒吧是一分七

132
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:40,640
measurements out of you so when you open
略小于高度

133
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:43,150
measurements out of you so when you open
the whole cards you won't see all the
插槽，每个酒吧都有这两个

134
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:43,160
the whole cards you won't see all the
每端都折叠的标签

135
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:45,550
the whole cards you won't see all the
measurements I've got that one room so
他们下来你不折他们，

136
00:03:45,550 --> 00:03:45,560
measurements I've got that one room so
给他们打分，你只要把它们折下来

137
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:48,759
measurements I've got that one room so
it's gonna be like that so I'll stick
他们会穿过他们的插槽，所以我会

138
00:03:48,759 --> 00:03:48,769
it's gonna be like that so I'll stick
像这样折下来然后喂

139
00:03:48,769 --> 00:03:51,280
it's gonna be like that so I'll stick

145
00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:02,199
and folded it and creased it so it's all
going to move nicely but when you're
我把数字放在里面

146
00:04:02,199 --> 00:04:02,209
going to move nicely but when you're
显示，但不要担心，这是

147
00:04:02,209 --> 00:04:04,449
going to move nicely but when you're
actually making your own don't forget to
另一对，所以现在您可以看到

148
00:04:04,449 --> 00:04:04,459
actually making your own don't forget to
像现在这样有两个酒吧

149
00:04:04,459 --> 00:04:06,580
actually making your own don't forget to
really crimp all the creases so they
可以添加图像并将其粘贴到

150
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:06,590
really crimp all the creases so they
如果您这样看，它们会在关闭时关闭

151
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:10,470
really crimp all the creases so they
they move really well so that's gonna go
您会看到插槽越来越近，

152
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:10,480
they move really well so that's gonna go
靠得更近，所以越靠近

153
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:15,759
they move really well so that's gonna go
like that right so stuck one side on and
酒吧是在舞台的前面

154
00:04:15,759 --> 00:04:15,769
like that right so stuck one side on and
较小的图像必须是

155
00:04:15,769 --> 00:04:19,870
like that right so stuck one side on and
now I'm going to stick the other side on
正面图片不得超过3个

156
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:19,880
now I'm going to stick the other side on
厘米宽

157
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:21,970
now I'm going to stick the other side on
to the other side to make this really
所以我将其粘在

158
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:21,980
to the other side to make this really
用空白面将其粘上

159
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:25,500
to the other side to make this really
long strip so to put there

160
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:25,510
long strip so to put there
想要背面有胶水，因此图像

161
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:28,380
long strip so to put there
the tabs go behind the back of the room
只是站在那里而不是

162
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:28,390
the tabs go behind the back of the room
在酒吧后面，您实际上可以将其粘上

163
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:36,830
the tabs go behind the back of the room
as I call it and put the glue on here
到酒吧的任何地方

关闭条将在

165
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:39,690
smooth it when you're gluing always
回到他们找到自己的地方

166
00:04:39,690 --> 00:04:39,700
smooth it when you're gluing always
所以如果你看它的结尾，你会看到

167
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:43,410
smooth it when you're gluing always
smear the glue right up to the crease so
两个插槽如何关闭

168
00:04:43,410 --> 00:04:43,420
smear the glue right up to the crease so
靠得越来越近

169
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:44,550
smear the glue right up to the crease so
there it is
这就是为什么不能超过三个

170
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:44,560
there it is
厘米宽，称为拉动

171
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:49,530
there it is
well that round to make it go smoothly
打开那里，现在我要戴上

172
00:04:49,530 --> 00:04:49,540
well that round to make it go smoothly
第二张图片，这是背面

173
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:53,400
well that round to make it go smoothly
so that's how the main long piece looks
吧这不超过七个

174
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:53,410
so that's how the main long piece looks
厘米宽，让我们现在放一些胶水

175
00:04:53,410 --> 00:04:57,600
so that's how the main long piece looks
so when it closes down it'll close like
在那一个可以下降到那里

176
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:57,610
so when it closes down it'll close like
只需将其关闭并向下按

177
00:04:57,610 --> 00:05:00,510
so when it closes down it'll close like
this so now we have to add it to the
所以这就是整个事情了

178
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:00,520
this so now we have to add it to the
您可能会感觉到的另一件事

179
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:05,300
this so now we have to add it to the
frame for that we have these two sleeves
他们实际上可以去的一侧滑动

180
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:05,310
frame for that we have these two sleeves
在太远的地方，这有点

181
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:08,460
frame for that we have these two sleeves
so we've got these two sleeves they're
棘手的，所以你可以放一点卡

182
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:08,470
so we've got these two sleeves they're
向下的每一侧都将充当

183
00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:13,050
so we've got these two sleeves they're
the pieces that go at the back you can
州长，也不要阻止它

184
00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:13,060
the pieces that go at the back you can
到目前为止，我只想简单地

185
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:14,880
the pieces that go at the back you can
see I haven't got them colored but
这样做，这应该是

186
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:14,890
see I haven't got them colored but
这一半应该足够长

187
00:05:14,890 --> 00:05:17,400
see I haven't got them colored but
there's a sleeve here and a sleeve here
认为如此，这些需要永远如此

188
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:17,410
there's a sleeve here and a sleeve here
略长于这些的宽度

189
00:05:17,410 --> 00:05:19,710
there's a sleeve here and a sleeve here
they're the ones that hold these sliding
滑动件这样继续下去

190
00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:19,720
they're the ones that hold these sliding
把它剪下来，让你滑动

191
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:22,860
they're the ones that hold these sliding
pieces in place and make them move the
进入完全关闭的位置

192
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:22,870
pieces in place and make them move the
然后在实际上放一些胶水

193
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:24,780
pieces in place and make them move the
way you want them to move so I've got
滑动片，我将滑动片放置

194
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:24,790
way you want them to move so I've got
最多是您希望它是如此

195
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:28,100
way you want them to move so I've got
two of those they're just a fraction
那里是幻灯片的边缘

196
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:28,110
two of those they're just a fraction
与框架边缘齐平

197
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:30,360
two of those they're just a fraction
longer than the whole height of the
然后我们将其粘在上面

198
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:30,370
longer than the whole height of the
靠在袖子上，所以它不会滑入

199
00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:33,570
longer than the whole height of the
sliding piece so they are ten point five
任何进一步的推动，我都会

200
00:05:33,570 --> 00:05:33,580
sliding piece so they are ten point five
整理一下，就是那边

201
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:36,990
sliding piece so they are ten point five
centimeters and they're going to glue on
这样就可以了，我会在

202
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:37,000
centimeters and they're going to glue on
另一侧，但滑盖是齐平的

203
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,360
centimeters and they're going to glue on
the back of this so I've got the
与框架的边缘，但一点点

204
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:39,370
the back of this so I've got the
一点胶在这里，然后粘贴

205
00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:40,800
the back of this so I've got the
measurements here but I'll keep the
再次统治片段，我还没有削减

206
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:40,810
measurements here but I'll keep the
预先确定大小

207
00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:42,990
measurements here but I'll keep the
measurements on the back I'm going to
使滑动件就位并

208
00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:43,000
measurements on the back I'm going to
坚持这支统治

209
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,580
measurements on the back I'm going to
stick these on this they go right up
阻止它继续下去，所以我们

210
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:46,590
stick these on this they go right up
现在你可以看到像这样

211
00:05:46,590 --> 00:05:50,310
stick these on this they go right up
flush against the window I put glue on
也许这些多余的东西看起来

212
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:50,320
flush against the window I put glue on
有点笨重，所以你实际上

213
00:05:50,320 --> 00:06:05,700
flush against the window I put glue on
the two tabs 1 2and these go like this
只是修剪他们只需要

214
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:05,710
the two tabs 1 2and these go like this
长约半厘米

215
00:06:05,710 --> 00:06:09,270
the two tabs 1 2and these go like this
ideally I would have measured it so that
比实际的滑动片

216
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:09,280
ideally I would have measured it so that
足以抵住袖子和

217
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:14,100
ideally I would have measured it so that
they're exactly equidistant above and
阻止它进行得太快，所以我会削减

218
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:14,110
they're exactly equidistant above and
那些都回来了哦，是的，所以

219
00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:18,300
they're exactly equidistant above and
below the window frame so there's one is
这就是开始阶段设定的

220
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:18,310
below the window frame so there's one is
一本书使他保持平整更长的时间

221
00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:21,240
below the window frame so there's one is
the other one and just make sure that's
它的顶部或所有折痕

222
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:21,250
the other one and just make sure that's
会加强，而且倾向于

223
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:24,570
the other one and just make sure that's
creased well as well but glue on those
保持自己的关闭方式

224
00:06:24,570 --> 00:06:24,580
creased well as well but glue on those
所以这是一个相当有趣的舞台

225
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:30,650
creased well as well but glue on those
two
将类型设置为

226


[音乐]

227
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:32,180
then be careful with this gluing you
