00:00:42,370 --> 00:00:45,149
here's an example without the heart just
showing how the whole thing folds down
都是基于真正的机制

10
00:00:45,149 --> 00:00:45,159
showing how the whole thing folds down
在这方面表达得非常好

11
00:00:45,159 --> 00:00:48,389
showing how the whole thing folds down
and lifts up high there's another little
菲利普（Philippe）的书看起来像是大爆炸

12
00:00:48,389 --> 00:00:48,399

open the page and it just lifts that
认为这本书真的很美

16
00:00:54,919 --> 00:00:54,929
open the page and it just lifts that
是你打开时要去的那个

19
00:00:58,929 --> 00:01:00,449
it's all based on a really mechanism
that's expressed really well in this
这是基于锐角V

20
00:01:00,449 --> 00:01:00,459
that's expressed really well in this
我只看一看这就是

21
00:01:00,459 --> 00:01:03,419
that's expressed really well in this
book by Philippe look big bang pop and
锐角V折

most of the time but the book I just
我就可以坚持下去

29
00:01:11,469 --> 00:01:13,770
most of the time but the book I just
think the book is really beautiful this

30
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:13,780
think the book is really beautiful this
这里有一块推高了

31
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:15,959
think the book is really beautiful this
is the one we're going for when you open
向上举起的手臂是

32
00:01:15,959 --> 00:01:15,969
is the one we're going for when you open
坚持这条线2,8

33
00:01:15,969 --> 00:01:18,899
is the one we're going for when you open
the page and it rises really high above
后面的厘米

34
00:01:18,899 --> 00:01:18,909
the page and it rises really high above
然后这是实际的部分

35
00:01:18,909 --> 00:01:21,749
the page and it rises really high above
the page so you do need to measure in
这是每个V型折叠77度

36
00:01:21,749 --> 00:01:21,759
the page so you do need to measure in
这个高度是十点五

37
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:24,480
the page so you do need to measure in
this it's based on the acute angle V
厘米，然后手臂在哪里

38
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:24,490
this it's based on the acute angle V
将是将坚持的手臂

39
00:01:24,490 --> 00:01:27,420
this it's based on the acute angle V
I'll just look at this one this is the
手臂粘在上肢上

I'll just look at this one this is the
acute angle V fold the that's doing the
手臂本身需要一些压力，所以

42
00:01:31,169 --> 00:01:31,179
acute angle V fold the that's doing the
它必须是我得分的两倍

43
00:01:31,179 --> 00:01:35,160
acute angle V fold the that's doing the
main lifting and then this bit here this
它在中间有一个选项卡

44
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:35,170
main lifting and then this bit here this
两端之间的距离

45
00:01:35,170 --> 00:01:38,310
main lifting and then this bit here this
is the asymmetric parallel fold which is
制表符是十一点八厘米

46

going to stick down here the angle is 67
degrees and I measured both sides so
推高地带加小块

54
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:50,710
degrees and I measured both sides so
最上面的是这十一点

55
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:51,989
degrees and I measured both sides so
I'll be able to just stick it straight
八加一五给你

have a piece here that's pushing up the
五，所以你把那些加在一起

60
00:01:57,959 --> 00:01:57,969
have a piece here that's pushing up the
得到了十三点三，那是

61
00:01:57,969 --> 00:02:00,419

70
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:12,890
this is the v-fold 77 degrees on each

this is the v-fold 77 degrees on each
side this height is ten point five
卡胶下来，然后我们就

这是两倍的厚度，因为它确实

75
00:02:19,130 --> 00:02:21,790
centimeters and then where the arm this
will be the arm that will stick behind

it has to be double thickness I scored
厚度使其具有额外的强度

it has to be double thickness I scored
it down the middle it's got a tab on
他们有折痕，这也使

86
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:34,910
it down the middle it's got a tab on
更强大的是，我们去了那里

87
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:37,210
it down the middle it's got a tab on

我还没有标记这条线的距离

91
00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:42,280
tabs is eleven point eight centimeters
so I'm going to glue that shut in a
它实际上是粘着的，但是很幸运

92
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:42,290
so I'm going to glue that shut in a
应该都很好地工作，所以把

93
00:02:42,290 --> 00:02:44,380
so I'm going to glue that shut in a
minute and just so you understand the
那里的胶粘到那个

you look at it as it folds down it's
asymmetric you're actually working from
也平行所以所有这些折痕

102
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:56,450
asymmetric you're actually working from
他们现在都是平行的

103
00:02:56,450 --> 00:02:58,690
asymmetric you're actually working from
here you've got the length of the
当它下来

104
00:02:58,690 --> 00:02:58,700
here you've got the length of the
这应该像我一样坚持

105
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:01,539
here you've got the length of the
pushing up strip plus the little piece
在那边放胶水

106
00:03:01,539 --> 00:03:01,549
pushing up strip plus the little piece

107
00:03:01,549 --> 00:03:05,559
pushing up strip plus the little piece
on the top that is this eleven point
这是平仓，您知道我们

108
00:03:05,559 --> 00:03:05,569
on the top that is this eleven point
可以打开它，看看它如何工作

109
00:03:05,569 --> 00:03:08,199
on the top that is this eleven point
eight plus one point five that gives you
我们去那里实际上这似乎额外

110
00:03:08,199 --> 00:03:08,209
eight plus one point five that gives you
我做的那块不是很结实

111
00:03:08,209 --> 00:03:10,630
eight plus one point five that gives you
thirteen point three and the other bit
足够使它实际上屈曲

112
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:10,640
thirteen point three and the other bit
理想情况下，我可能会做到这一点

113
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,789
thirteen point three and the other bit
on the base you've got two point eight
三个或四个三个或四个厚度

114
00:03:12,789 --> 00:03:12,799
on the base you've got two point eight
然后我们可以理想地坚持我

115
00:03:12,799 --> 00:03:16,630
on the base you've got two point eight
and on the upright you've got ten point
认为它会更厚

116
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:16,640
and on the upright you've got ten point
卡本来会更硬

117
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,069
and on the upright you've got ten point
five so you add those together you've
这一点更强大，这是基本的

118
00:03:18,069 --> 00:03:18,079
five so you add those together you've
想法，当您关闭它时，它就会折叠起来

119
00:03:18,079 --> 00:03:19,780
five so you add those together you've
got thirteen point three so that's
所以不，我们的天空很高

120
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:19,790
got thirteen point three so that's
卡，这是一个较小的示例，

121
00:03:19,790 --> 00:03:22,080
got thirteen point three so that's
giving you balance this is a balanced
因为它更小而不是

122
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:22,090
giving you balance this is a balanced
卡片不是那么僵硬

123
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:25,210
giving you balance this is a balanced
asymmetric parallel fold I just think it
它确实站起来，似乎确实

124
00:03:25,210 --> 00:03:25,220
asymmetric parallel fold I just think it
实际工作比

125
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:27,309

all together make sure that it does
我刚做的一个，也许我们可以

126
00:03:27,309 --> 00:03:27,319
all together make sure that it does
只是把这颗心从这里粘下来

127
00:03:27,319 --> 00:03:31,690
all together make sure that it does
actually work this is going to go I'm
