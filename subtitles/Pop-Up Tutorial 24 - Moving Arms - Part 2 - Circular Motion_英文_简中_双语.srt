00:01:08,390 --> 00:01:12,670
it can be any sort of circular motion
and then this is the Castaway pirates
例子这是基于并行

26
00:01:12,670 --> 00:01:12,680
and then this is the Castaway pirates

那么你有这个L形的片断，

30
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:17,210
think it's an absolute work of genius
这就是车轮卡在

31
00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:19,750

34
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:22,760
the spread you see this is the circular
东西是轮子的中心

35
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:24,700
the spread you see this is the circular

就在这一点上正确，所以内在

36
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:24,710
motion based on the mechanism that I'm
L形的角在所有

37
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:27,010
motion based on the mechanism that I'm
about to show you so there's one example
折痕相遇，然后中心

38
00:01:27,010 --> 00:01:27,020
about to show you so there's one example
车轮在那一点上，所以我就

39
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:30,160
about to show you so there's one example
in this book he's spinning around watch
让你一个

40
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:30,170
in this book he's spinning around watch
所以在这里我已经准备好了

41
00:01:30,170 --> 00:01:32,560
in this book he's spinning around watch
the shark as I open the page and he
件，我们有另一个基础表

42
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:32,570
the shark as I open the page and he
这是平行四边形，所以我会

43
00:01:32,570 --> 00:01:35,080
the shark as I open the page and he
spins around this is circular motion
首先将平行四边形粘贴在

44
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:35,090
spins around this is circular motion
我们需要进行衡量，因此将

45
00:01:35,090 --> 00:01:43,570
spins around this is circular motion
based on moving arms so now to show you
平行四边形的中心折痕

46
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:43,580
based on moving arms so now to show you
一块到基地的中央沟

47
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:48,100
based on moving arms so now to show you
how to make one of these this is an
标记其中一个折痕所在的位置

48
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:48,110
how to make one of these this is an
把整个事情都翻了，所以我已经

49
00:01:48,110 --> 00:01:50,289
how to make one of these this is an
example this is based on the parallel
标志着短边，现在是长边

50
00:01:50,289 --> 00:01:50,299
example this is based on the parallel
方面将坚持与

51
00:01:50,299 --> 00:01:53,320
example this is based on the parallel
fold which is tutorial 5 and so here's
底座平整时的平行四边形

52
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:53,330
fold which is tutorial 5 and so here's
整个平行四边形是平坦的，所以我们可以

53
00:01:53,330 --> 00:01:55,539
fold which is tutorial 5 and so here's
the parallel fold with a little counter
保持平坦，然后将胶水涂在

54
00:01:55,539 --> 00:01:55,549
the parallel fold with a little counter
这里的其他选项卡和胶水

55
00:01:55,549 --> 00:01:58,210
the parallel fold with a little counter
fold folded into the corner up here and
确保它真的正常工作我

56
00:01:58,210 --> 00:01:58,220
fold folded into the corner up here and
没涂太多胶水

57
00:01:58,220 --> 00:02:00,399
fold folded into the corner up here and
then you have this l-shaped piece and
这样我现在有这个

58
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:00,409
then you have this l-shaped piece and
是L形的

59
00:02:00,409 --> 00:02:02,370
then you have this l-shaped piece and
that's what the wheel is stuck to the
坚持那样，所以需要这个

60
00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:02,380
that's what the wheel is stuck to the
折痕所在的虚线

61
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:06,039
that's what the wheel is stuck to the
key thing is there's a crease across one
是这样，我只需要用眼睛就可以做到

62
00:02:06,039 --> 00:02:06,049
key thing is there's a crease across one
衡量它或任何顶级

63
00:02:06,049 --> 00:02:09,249
key thing is there's a crease across one
arm of the L so that this piece can bend
坚持在那里有点我

64
00:02:09,249 --> 00:02:09,259
arm of the L so that this piece can bend
看过一些书，

65
00:02:09,259 --> 00:02:12,160
arm of the L so that this piece can bend
up and down and then the other crucial
由一张卡片制成

66
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:12,170
up and down and then the other crucial
折叠并粘下来，以便胶水

67
00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:14,080
up and down and then the other crucial
thing is the center of the wheel
在那儿确保内角

68
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:14,090
thing is the center of the wheel
这个L形的块就在哪里

69
00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:17,080
thing is the center of the wheel
goes right on this point so the inner
所有的血液汇合，然后您需要

70
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:17,090
goes right on this point so the inner
得到这个圆的中心点

71
00:02:17,090 --> 00:02:20,080
goes right on this point so the inner
corner of the l-shape goes where all the
就在同一点上

72
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:20,090
corner of the l-shape goes where all the
所以这已经开始动了，但是

73
00:02:20,090 --> 00:02:22,630
corner of the l-shape goes where all the
creases meet and then the center of the
如您所见，因为它位于其中之一上

74
00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:22,640
creases meet and then the center of the
圆角件倾向于

75
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:25,510
creases meet and then the center of the
wheel goes on that point so I'll just
抬起一个角度，所以你有两个

76
00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:25,520
wheel goes on that point so I'll just
您可以选择一个这样的选择

77
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,240
wheel goes on that point so I'll just
make you one
有一块粘在

78
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:27,250
make you one
后面的平行四边形

79
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:30,100
make you one
so here I've prepared the bits and
这样的圆圈在这里继续

80
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:30,110
so here I've prepared the bits and
实际上使圆圈向上

81
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:32,550
so here I've prepared the bits and
pieces we've got another base sheet
你可以做的另一种方法是一块

82
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:32,560
pieces we've got another base sheet
在它下面，所以你可以把它放在下面

83
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:37,449
pieces we've got another base sheet
here's the parallelogram piece so I'll
在这里，并保持左下方

84
00:02:37,449 --> 00:02:37,459
here's the parallelogram piece so I'll
圈下来，所以我想我会做一个

85
00:02:37,459 --> 00:02:39,880
here's the parallelogram piece so I'll
start by sticking the parallelogram on
在这种情况下的那些被切掉

86
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:39,890
start by sticking the parallelogram on
使其尺寸更好，然后放

87
00:02:39,890 --> 00:02:42,940
start by sticking the parallelogram on
and we need to measure that so put the
胶水一点点滴下来

88
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:42,950
and we need to measure that so put the
如果这个额外的，这将得到改善

89
00:02:42,950 --> 00:02:44,860
and we need to measure that so put the
central crease of the parallelogram
一块是合适的平行四边形

90
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:44,870
central crease of the parallelogram
向下并加入页面
