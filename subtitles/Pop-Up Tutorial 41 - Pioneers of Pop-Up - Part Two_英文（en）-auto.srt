00:12:53,050 --> 00:12:54,840
there's actually a pillar underneath
which is parallel with one of these

494
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:54,850
which is parallel with one of these

495
00:12:54,850 --> 00:12:56,820
which is parallel with one of these
sides that pushes the top of the box up

unusual thing about this a lot of boats

594
00:15:36,929 --> 00:15:36,939
unusual thing about this a lot of boats

595
00:15:36,939 --> 00:15:38,399
unusual thing about this a lot of boats
they just go straight down the middle

596
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:38,409
they just go straight down the middle

597
00:15:38,409 --> 00:15:40,409
they just go straight down the middle
they follow the spine that's the easy

598
00:15:40,409 --> 00:15:40,419
they follow the spine that's the easy

599
00:15:40,419 --> 00:15:42,809
they follow the spine that's the easy
way to make them and this has been made

600
00:15:42,809 --> 00:15:42,819
way to make them and this has been made

601
00:15:42,819 --> 00:15:45,149
way to make them and this has been made
going across the spine which is really

602
00:15:45,149 --> 00:15:45,159
going across the spine which is really

603
00:15:45,159 --> 00:15:49,849
going across the spine which is really
unusual so it is actually a box

604
00:15:49,849 --> 00:15:49,859
unusual so it is actually a box

605
00:15:49,859 --> 00:15:52,889
unusual so it is actually a box
underneath here is actually a flat plane

606
00:15:52,889 --> 00:15:52,899
underneath here is actually a flat plane

607
00:15:52,899 --> 00:15:55,229
underneath here is actually a flat plane
so there's the three planes one here one

608
00:15:55,229 --> 00:15:55,239
so there's the three planes one here one

609
00:15:55,239 --> 00:15:57,359
so there's the three planes one here one
on the spine one at the back that's

610
00:15:57,359 --> 00:15:57,369
on the spine one at the back that's

611
00:15:57,369 --> 00:15:59,369
on the spine one at the back that's
giving you the box and then the way the

612
00:15:59,369 --> 00:15:59,379
giving you the box and then the way the

613
00:15:59,379 --> 00:16:01,499
giving you the box and then the way the
sides have been added on that enables

614
00:16:01,499 --> 00:16:01,509
sides have been added on that enables

615
00:16:01,509 --> 00:16:05,239
sides have been added on that enables
you to have the pointy brow at the front

616
00:16:05,239 --> 00:16:05,249


617
00:16:05,249 --> 00:16:09,599
and the next spread is this one I think

618
00:16:09,599 --> 00:16:09,609
and the next spread is this one I think

619
00:16:09,609 --> 00:16:11,279
