now we want symmetry on on the base and
being a v-fold this will fold down in
用沟渠可以制作襟翼

146
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:43,970
being a v-fold this will fold down in
我会选一个给你看

147
00:04:43,970 --> 00:04:45,999
being a v-fold this will fold down in
the direction that the vias pointing so
如何工作需要折纸

148
00:04:45,999 --> 00:04:46,009
the direction that the vias pointing so
折成一半真的很好

149
00:04:46,009 --> 00:04:49,120
the direction that the vias pointing so
this will fold down like this so to get
将折痕折回去

150
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:49,130
this will fold down like this so to get
自己一次又一次地压着他们

151
00:04:49,130 --> 00:04:51,490
this will fold down like this so to get
the symmetry we just just glue one side
这是您的基础，现在我们将建立

152
00:04:51,490 --> 00:04:51,500
the symmetry we just just glue one side
到这里很冷所以

153
00:04:51,500 --> 00:05:04,820
the symmetry we just just glue one side
first
拿张卡片不计

154


随便切一下就知道了

155
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:07,570
up near the up near the top of the page
将您的尺寸折成半折痕

156
00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:07,580
up near the up near the top of the page
很好地将其折回自身

157
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:10,880
up near the up near the top of the page
make sure the central central crease on
再次下降，然后我们将

158
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:10,890
make sure the central central crease on
基本的V折，所以这是折线

159
00:05:10,890 --> 00:05:13,690
make sure the central central crease on
the pop-up is
从折起大约半英寸开始

160
00:05:13,690 --> 00:05:13,700
the pop-up is
远离远处倾斜一个角度

161
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:17,330
the pop-up is
glue it down so that's one side glued
从中央折起再折回去

162
00:05:17,330 --> 00:05:17,340
glue it down so that's one side glued
本身，你打开它

163
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:21,350
glue it down so that's one side glued
down firmly moving nicely I can fold the
您已经具备基本的V型折叠设计

164
00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:21,360
down firmly moving nicely I can fold the
你有所有的折痕

165
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,360
down firmly moving nicely I can fold the
whole piece into its closed position and
向下箭头，所以现在我们将

166
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:23,370
whole piece into its closed position and
只需修剪一下即可制作用于

167
00:05:23,370 --> 00:05:30,110
whole piece into its closed position and
put glue on the other tab smear the glue
V形饰边更加锋利，因此

168
00:05:30,110 --> 00:05:30,120
put glue on the other tab smear the glue
它不会重叠和脊椎，所以这是

169
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:35,510
put glue on the other tab smear the glue
to the the up to the crease and then
您的基本V折件现在让我们制作一个

170
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:35,520
to the the up to the crease and then
顶部的手机

171
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:41,110
to the the up to the crease and then
fold the page shut
所以这次来这样

172


我或多或少与

00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:44,750
so here here we have this this V fold
与原始的，你可以进来

174
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:44,760
so here here we have this this V fold

177
00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:49,670
now has an extra guard created on top
which you can build into or you can add
在这种情况下没有错，我想要

178
00:05:49,670 --> 00:05:49,680
which you can build into or you can add
顶部略窄，所以我要

179
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:53,330
which you can build into or you can add
on you may just choose to take some odd
从角落修剪下来

183
00:05:59,730 --> 00:06:01,880
piece of card like this and you can just
stick it on like this or like this or
在顶部，所以我们对折

184
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:01,890
stick it on like this or like this or
他们指向的方向，所以我们

185
00:06:01,890 --> 00:06:07,520
stick it on like this or like this or
you know I can fold it and you can glue
希望它在您的顶部附近

186
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:07,530
you know I can fold it and you can glue
页面我们有对称性，所以两个

187
00:06:07,530 --> 00:06:09,830
you know I can fold it and you can glue
that glue that into the gulley anywhere
中央折痕两侧的角度

我大约要在45度左右行驶，

194


再次无所谓，只取决于

195
00:06:27,029 --> 00:06:30,389
so put it in and as you build with as
取决于您要创建什么形状

196
