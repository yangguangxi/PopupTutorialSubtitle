this tutorial is about curved shapes
那就是围绕着折痕

3
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:40,709
this tutorial is about curved shapes
that is the taking the crease around the
弯曲，这是最简单的

4
00:00:40,709 --> 00:00:40,719
that is the taking the crease around the
给你喙或鼻子，这是一个

5
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:43,079
that is the taking the crease around the
bend so this is at its most simple it
这样更极端的例子

6

bend so this is at its most simple it
如果您正在折痕全部

7
00:00:43,089 --> 00:00:46,919
bend so this is at its most simple it
gives you a beak or a nose this is a
围绕完整曲线的方式

8
00:00:46,919 --> 00:00:46,929
gives you a beak or a nose this is a
不再是另一个例子了

9
00:00:46,929 --> 00:00:51,209
gives you a beak or a nose this is a
more more extreme example so in this
