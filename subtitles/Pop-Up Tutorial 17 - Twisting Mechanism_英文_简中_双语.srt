00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:36,599
in this tutorial we're going to look at
在本教程中，我们将研究

2
00:00:36,599 --> 00:00:36,609
in this tutorial we're going to look at
扭曲机制非常

3
00:00:36,609 --> 00:00:39,119
in this tutorial we're going to look at
the twisting mechanism which is a very
令人愉悦的机制

4
00:00:39,119 --> 00:00:39,129
the twisting mechanism which is a very
页面打开机制时的操作

5
00:00:39,129 --> 00:00:40,939
the twisting mechanism which is a very
pleasing mechanism it has a very unusual
它是由两个V组成的

6
00:00:40,939 --> 00:00:40,949
pleasing mechanism it has a very unusual
文件何时互相指向

7
00:00:40,949 --> 00:00:44,819
pleasing mechanism it has a very unusual
action as the page opens the mechanism
底座是平的，它们平躺，然后

8
00:00:44,819 --> 00:00:44,829
action as the page opens the mechanism
您可以在顶部构建许多东西

9
00:00:44,829 --> 00:00:48,479
action as the page opens the mechanism
twists around it's it's made of two V
因此，这里有一个打开的例子

10
00:00:48,479 --> 00:00:48,489
twists around it's it's made of two V
人物转过身来

11
00:00:48,489 --> 00:00:51,029
twists around it's it's made of two V
files pointing at each other when when
本质上，你有六架飞机，所以

12
00:00:51,029 --> 00:00:51,039
files pointing at each other when when
每个顶部两个，底部每个

13
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:53,309
files pointing at each other when when
the base is flat they lie flat and then
V折，然后有两个

14
00:00:53,309 --> 00:00:53,319
the base is flat they lie flat and then
平行折叠在顶部，然后

15
00:00:53,319 --> 00:00:54,869
the base is flat they lie flat and then
you can build a number of things on top
您可以构建的沟渠

16
00:00:54,869 --> 00:00:54,879
you can build a number of things on top
封闭的沟渠

17
00:00:54,879 --> 00:01:01,229
you can build a number of things on top
of it so here is an example as it opens
关闭，您显然有一个

18
00:01:01,229 --> 00:01:01,239
of it so here is an example as it opens
平行折叠下方的顶部

19
00:01:01,239 --> 00:01:04,500
of it so here is an example as it opens
the figure twists around and opens up in
顶部有两个，底部有两个

20
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:04,510
the figure twists around and opens up in
V折所在的位置，然后在

21
00:01:04,510 --> 00:01:08,190
the figure twists around and opens up in
essence you've got six planes so there's
V形折叠还有另外两个

22
00:01:08,190 --> 00:01:08,200
essence you've got six planes so there's
你有四个那里两个那里六个，

23
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:11,520
essence you've got six planes so there's
two on each top and bottom on each of
然后那里有七个沟渠

24
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:11,530
two on each top and bottom on each of
建筑，这实际上并没有

25
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:13,170
two on each top and bottom on each of
the V folds and then it's got two on the
内置在任何沟渠中

26
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:13,180
the V folds and then it's got two on the
扩展平原，使这些

27
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:14,999
the V folds and then it's got two on the
parallel folds on top and then the
头和手臂从一架飞机上下来

28
00:01:14,999 --> 00:01:15,009
parallel folds on top and then the
这是一个，然后这些

29
00:01:15,009 --> 00:01:16,620
parallel folds on top and then the
gullies that you can build into the
从另外两个开始，所以它正在使用

30
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:16,630
gullies that you can build into the
他们的四个飞机

31
00:01:16,630 --> 00:01:19,740
gullies that you can build into the
gullies that that close as the base
您需要一个底纸，这是底纸

32
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:19,750
gullies that that close as the base
床单折成半折

33
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:22,170
gullies that that close as the base
closes you've got one obviously in the
彻底，然后你需要另一个

34
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:22,180
closes you've got one obviously in the
关于我的另一件大事

35
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:25,260
closes you've got one obviously in the
top underneath the parallel fold you've
实际上已经在

36
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:25,270
top underneath the parallel fold you've
中间那种方式真的折叠

37
00:01:25,270 --> 00:01:27,599
top underneath the parallel fold you've
got two under top and two on the bottom
彻底地，我在每个位置都添加了一个折痕

38
00:01:27,599 --> 00:01:27,609
got two under top and two on the bottom
结束粘贴标签，然后您想要

39
00:01:27,609 --> 00:01:30,209
got two under top and two on the bottom
where the V folds are and then within
另一个折痕在中间

40
00:01:30,209 --> 00:01:30,219
where the V folds are and then within
它使您纵向折叠它使

41
00:01:30,219 --> 00:01:32,160
where the V folds are and then within
the v-folds you've got another two so
确定这次确保那两个

42
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:32,170
the v-folds you've got another two so
中央折痕相互对齐

43
00:01:32,170 --> 00:01:35,219
the v-folds you've got another two so
you've got four there two there six and
这样您就知道一切都会正常进行

44
00:01:35,219 --> 00:01:35,229
you've got four there two there six and
很好，所以有

45
00:01:35,229 --> 00:01:36,870
you've got four there two there six and
then one there so seven gullies to
把它折起来再折起来

46
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:36,880
then one there so seven gullies to
真的很彻底，所以你有

47
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:39,810
then one there so seven gullies to
building and this one hasn't actually
现在有了十字形，您实际上需要

48
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:39,820
building and this one hasn't actually
这样又有两个折痕

49
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:41,760
building and this one hasn't actually
built into any of the gullies it's just
所以一种方法是将其折叠并

50
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:41,770
built into any of the gullies it's just
带上折痕线，以便您可以做

51
00:01:41,770 --> 00:01:44,580
built into any of the gullies it's just
extending the plains so that these the
这样，但这是一种方法

52
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:44,590
extending the plains so that these the
并将它折回去，这样另一个

53
00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:46,679
extending the plains so that these the
head and arm that's coming off one plane
其他方式，如果您发现真的

54
00:01:46,679 --> 00:01:46,689
head and arm that's coming off one plane
很难用卡带盒

55
00:01:46,689 --> 00:01:48,389
head and arm that's coming off one plane
this is coming off one and then these
因此，产生45度平方的原因

56
00:01:48,389 --> 00:01:48,399
this is coming off one and then these
学位以及您的目标

57
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:50,580
this is coming off one and then these
are coming off two others so it's using
是8个角度，它们都将是

58
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:50,590
are coming off two others so it's using
45度，这样您就可以放下

59
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:56,980
are coming off two others so it's using
four of their planes
中央折痕用

60


铅笔或用你的酒吧得分

61
00:01:56,990 --> 00:01:59,859
you need a base sheet here's the base
有一个，然后你可以做同样的

62
00:01:59,859 --> 00:01:59,869
you need a base sheet here's the base
在另一边，那就是

63
00:01:59,869 --> 00:02:02,980
you need a base sheet here's the base
sheet folded in half crease really
我们想要的线我们现在不会折叠

64
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:02,990
sheet folded in half crease really
您只需将其折叠即可

65
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:06,820
sheet folded in half crease really
thoroughly and then you need another
通过确保这些来检查它

66
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:06,830
thoroughly and then you need another
这些折痕排成一列，看上去

67
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:10,930
thoroughly and then you need another
another piece about this big I've
早期所以有点棘手，这是一个

68
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:10,940
another piece about this big I've
有点棘手，但这就是你的结局

69
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:12,730
another piece about this big I've
actually already creased it in the
与折痕都使

70
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:12,740
actually already creased it in the
星形，现在您应该能够

71
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:14,740
actually already creased it in the
middle that way folded it really
像这样推动它，这就是

72
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:14,750
middle that way folded it really
最终形成这些形状

73
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:19,090
middle that way folded it really
thoroughly I've added a a crease at each
两个中央折痕应齐平

74
00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:19,100
thoroughly I've added a a crease at each
彼此

75
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:23,440
thoroughly I've added a a crease at each
end for gluing tags and then you want
理想情况下，有一点余地

76
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:23,450
end for gluing tags and then you want
但

77
00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:26,080
end for gluing tags and then you want
another crease going down the middle of
他们彼此之间更多的闪光

78
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:26,090
another crease going down the middle of
更好，然后有时候你可以

79
00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:29,020
another crease going down the middle of
it so you fold it lengthwise so make
删掉最后一点，因为

80
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:29,030
it so you fold it lengthwise so make
很多卡都聚在一起

81
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:31,030
it so you fold it lengthwise so make
sure this time make sure those two
在那里，它有点厚

82
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:31,040
sure this time make sure those two
所以只是使其工作更多一点

83
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,460
sure this time make sure those two
central creases line up with each other
顺利，您可以将其切断，这样

84
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:33,470
central creases line up with each other
这就是你最终得到的形状

85
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:35,949
central creases line up with each other
so that you know it's all going to work
现在您只希望每个末端都有一个标签

86
00:02:35,949 --> 00:02:35,959
so that you know it's all going to work
因此在此结束时做一个标签

87
00:02:35,959 --> 00:02:39,850
so that you know it's all going to work
nicely so there's the there's that
然后再减少一点

88
00:02:39,850 --> 00:02:39,860
nicely so there's the there's that
而不是仅仅沿着

89
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:42,430
nicely so there's the there's that
crease fold it back on it so fold it
折痕那里再剪一点

90
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:42,440
crease fold it back on it so fold it
否则你会得到一点

91
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:46,900
crease fold it back on it so fold it
really thoroughly so you've got you've
在这里可能会缠住其他东西，所以

92
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:46,910
really thoroughly so you've got you've
你只是把它切断到

93
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:48,610
really thoroughly so you've got you've
got a cross shape now you actually need
角落把它拿走，所以你有一个

94
00:02:48,610 --> 00:02:48,620
got a cross shape now you actually need
将标签从一端粘上，然后

95
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:50,770
got a cross shape now you actually need
two more creases going across like this
关键是其他粘合

96
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:50,780
two more creases going across like this
选项卡必须与对角线相反，不在

97
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:54,220
two more creases going across like this
so one way is to just fold it across and
相同的一面，这是第二个

98
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:54,230
so one way is to just fold it across and
胶合时间，这就是你想要的形状

99
00:02:54,230 --> 00:02:57,400
so one way is to just fold it across and
bring the creasing lines so you can do
最后，现在你要

100
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:57,410
bring the creasing lines so you can do
把胶水我需要四个中央

101
00:02:57,410 --> 00:03:00,009
bring the creasing lines so you can do
it like that but that's one way of doing
面板，所有这些都将粘在上面

102
00:03:00,009 --> 00:03:00,019
it like that but that's one way of doing
中央折痕对齐

103
00:03:00,019 --> 00:03:03,280
it like that but that's one way of doing
it and fold that back on it so the other
底部中央折痕

104
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:03,290
it and fold that back on it so the other
而这四个粘在一起，你可以

105
00:03:03,290 --> 00:03:05,050
it and fold that back on it so the other
other ways if you find that really
整个东西都可以粘在一起

106
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:05,060
other ways if you find that really
所以你可以把胶水涂在这四个

107
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:07,690
other ways if you find that really
difficult you can use a cassette square
同时确保我们

108
00:03:07,690 --> 00:03:07,700
difficult you can use a cassette square
不要错过我们折叠的胶水

109
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:09,940
difficult you can use a cassette square
so the causes of the set square of 45
进入该位置使其更容易

110
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:09,950
so the causes of the set square of 45
使胶水达到折痕而不是

111
00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:11,710
so the causes of the set square of 45
degrees and what you're aiming for here
超越

112
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:11,720
degrees and what you're aiming for here
对，所以把它打开平整

113
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:13,600
degrees and what you're aiming for here
is 8 angles and they're all going to be
中央折痕与中央折痕

114
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:13,610
is 8 angles and they're all going to be
在底座上，然后粘在上面

115
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:16,800
is 8 angles and they're all going to be
45 degrees so you can just put that down
将那些胶粘平放，然后关闭

116
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:16,810
45 degrees so you can just put that down
它和这两个部分

117
00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:19,990
45 degrees so you can just put that down
that central crease mark it with a
应该举起来，这样在一起

118
00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:20,000
that central crease mark it with a
在那里，您可以看到两种V字体

119
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,870
that central crease mark it with a
pencil or score it with your bar oh so
一起打开和关闭它

120
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:22,880
pencil or score it with your bar oh so
所以现在你要贴另一个

121
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:25,449
pencil or score it with your bar oh so
there's one and then you can do the same
跨越这两个让我们尝试

122
00:03:25,449 --> 00:03:25,459
there's one and then you can do the same
有点红色

123
00:03:25,459 --> 00:03:31,720
there's one and then you can do the same
on the other side so that's the that's
我们不希望它超出这个范围

124
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:31,730
on the other side so that's the that's
我们已经附上了一块，所以瞄准

125
00:03:31,730 --> 00:03:34,420
on the other side so that's the that's
the line we want we won't fold it so now
或多或少都一样，然后

126
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:34,430
the line we want we won't fold it so now
不得短于距离

127
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:37,990
the line we want we won't fold it so now
you just fold it along there you can
在这两个折痕之间

128
00:03:37,990 --> 00:03:38,000
you just fold it along there you can
短于整个机制就不能

129
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,440
you just fold it along there you can
check it by just making sure that these
打开时间越长

130
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:40,450
check it by just making sure that these
它会站立得越多，所以我们开始

131
00:03:40,450 --> 00:03:43,870
check it by just making sure that these
these creases line up and they look the
只是将其折叠在中间，这样您就可以

132
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:43,880
these creases line up and they look the
像中间一样折皱

133
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:48,520
these creases line up and they look the
early so that is a bit tricky it is a
那然后这将适合

134
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:48,530
early so that is a bit tricky it is a
这样，如果我们看看这个

135
00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:52,900
early so that is a bit tricky it is a
bit tricky but so that is you end up
关于，我们只说一个

136
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:52,910
bit tricky but so that is you end up
两端各分开1厘米

137
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:55,000
bit tricky but so that is you end up
with the with the creases all making a
半

138
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:55,010
with the with the creases all making a
保持对称，我们可以采取

139
00:03:55,010 --> 00:03:57,250
with the with the creases all making a
star shape and now you should be able to
像这样的一块
