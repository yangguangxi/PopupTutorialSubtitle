this tutorial is about quite an unusual
pull strip where you pull the tab a flap

6
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:42,510
pull strip where you pull the tab a flap

7
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:45,680
pull strip where you pull the tab a flap
appears and flips over the key to it all

8
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:45,690
appears and flips over the key to it all

9
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:49,040
appears and flips over the key to it all
is a little strip underneath here which

10
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:49,050
is a little strip underneath here which

11
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:51,920
is a little strip underneath here which
has 5 sections there the key to the

12
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:51,930
has 5 sections there the key to the

13
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:54,290
has 5 sections there the key to the
mechanism so I've got all the pieces

14
00:00:54,290 --> 00:00:54,300
mechanism so I've got all the pieces

15
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:59,780
mechanism so I've got all the pieces
prepared here this is the base it's got

16
00:00:59,780 --> 00:00:59,790
prepared here this is the base it's got

17
00:00:59,790 --> 00:01:02,390
prepared here this is the base it's got
a crease here so when you look at this

18
00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:02,400
a crease here so when you look at this

19
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:05,299
a crease here so when you look at this
one the bottom end folds over so that's

20
00:01:05,299 --> 00:01:05,309
one the bottom end folds over so that's

21
00:01:05,309 --> 00:01:09,020
one the bottom end folds over so that's
the crease there I've also put a crease

22
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:09,030
the crease there I've also put a crease

23
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:12,050
the crease there I've also put a crease
down each side so you've got tabs so

24
00:01:12,050 --> 00:01:12,060
down each side so you've got tabs so

25
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:13,850
down each side so you've got tabs so
that there's tabs here which will fold

26
00:01:13,850 --> 00:01:13,860
that there's tabs here which will fold

27
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:15,890
that there's tabs here which will fold
it shut so I'll just cut those off so

28
00:01:15,890 --> 00:01:15,900
it shut so I'll just cut those off so

29
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:20,000
it shut so I'll just cut those off so
you can see how it's actually made this

30
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:20,010
you can see how it's actually made this

31
00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:22,580
you can see how it's actually made this
section is 10 centimeters and this is 15

32
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:22,590
section is 10 centimeters and this is 15

centimeters

35
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:35,470
centimeters
I'll just cut these off

36
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:35,480


37
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:37,930
this is your base sheet and this is

38
00:01:37,930 --> 00:01:37,940
this is your base sheet and this is

39
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:43,180
this is your base sheet and this is
going to fold over like this here's the

40
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:43,190
going to fold over like this here's the

41
00:01:43,190 --> 00:01:45,760
going to fold over like this here's the
flap five centimeters by five

42
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:45,770
flap five centimeters by five

43
00:01:45,770 --> 00:01:49,990
flap five centimeters by five
centimeters this is the little strip the

44
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:50,000
centimeters this is the little strip the

45
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,510
centimeters this is the little strip the
key to it all that flips it over

46
00:01:52,510 --> 00:01:52,520
key to it all that flips it over

47
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:55,660
key to it all that flips it over
I'll just score it so it'll all move

48
00:01:55,660 --> 00:01:55,670
I'll just score it so it'll all move

49
00:01:55,670 --> 00:02:20,900
I'll just score it so it'll all move
really smoothly

50
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:20,910


51
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:24,810
so here it is and we just crease all

52
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:24,820
so here it is and we just crease all

53
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:27,870
so here it is and we just crease all
those really well so they move really

54
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:27,880
those really well so they move really

55
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:38,700
those really well so they move really
nicely when it's all assembled take the

56
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:38,710
nicely when it's all assembled take the

57
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:42,630
nicely when it's all assembled take the
strip and the very end strip is going to

58
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:42,640
strip and the very end strip is going to

59
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:45,870
strip and the very end strip is going to
stick onto the full strip the second bit

60
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:45,880
stick onto the full strip the second bit

61
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:48,120
stick onto the full strip the second bit
is going to stick onto the flat it's

62
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:48,130
is going to stick onto the flat it's

63
00:02:48,130 --> 00:02:51,810
is going to stick onto the flat it's
going to be like that

64
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:51,820
going to be like that

65
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:56,610
going to be like that
so I'll just glue that piece on one

66
00:02:56,610 --> 00:02:56,620
so I'll just glue that piece on one

67
00:02:56,620 --> 00:03:05,520
so I'll just glue that piece on one
section in from the end so that's going

68
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:05,530
section in from the end so that's going

69
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:16,210
section in from the end so that's going
to be like that

70
00:03:16,210 --> 00:03:16,220


71
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:18,460
and then with all these things they'll

72
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:18,470
and then with all these things they'll

73
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:20,560
and then with all these things they'll
pull strip is double sickness so I've

74
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:20,570
pull strip is double sickness so I've

75
00:03:20,570 --> 00:03:21,730
pull strip is double sickness so I've
already scored it

76
00:03:21,730 --> 00:03:21,740
already scored it

77
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:24,970
already scored it
I've already folded it now to make it

78
00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:24,980
I've already folded it now to make it

79
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:36,090
I've already folded it now to make it
extra strong we'll glue it back to back

80
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:36,100


81
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:39,250
we'll just fold these so we glue them at

82
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:39,260
we'll just fold these so we glue them at

83
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:41,500
we'll just fold these so we glue them at
the very ends but we'll just fold in

84
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:41,510
the very ends but we'll just fold in

85
00:03:41,510 --> 00:03:49,440
the very ends but we'll just fold in
beforehand and this is going to glue in

86
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:49,450
beforehand and this is going to glue in

87
00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:53,560
beforehand and this is going to glue in
the pull strips going to go here this is

88
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:53,570
the pull strips going to go here this is

89
00:03:53,570 --> 00:03:55,690
the pull strips going to go here this is
going to glue onto the pull strip and

90
00:03:55,690 --> 00:03:55,700
going to glue onto the pull strip and

91
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:59,100
going to glue onto the pull strip and
this is going to glue in here so I just

92
00:03:59,100 --> 00:03:59,110
this is going to glue in here so I just

93
00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:02,050
this is going to glue in here so I just
check the distance in and it's pulled

94
00:04:02,050 --> 00:04:02,060
check the distance in and it's pulled

95
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:09,490
check the distance in and it's pulled
out like this this end this is going to

96
00:04:09,490 --> 00:04:09,500
out like this this end this is going to

97
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:12,610
out like this this end this is going to
be like this this is going to be down

98
00:04:12,610 --> 00:04:12,620
be like this this is going to be down

99
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:17,500
be like this this is going to be down
here when it's glued in place it's going

100
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:17,510
here when it's glued in place it's going

101
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:20,229
here when it's glued in place it's going
to be like this but with the flap

102
00:04:20,229 --> 00:04:20,239
to be like this but with the flap

103
00:04:20,239 --> 00:04:21,789
to be like this but with the flap
underneath so that's going to be

104
00:04:21,789 --> 00:04:21,799
underneath so that's going to be

105
00:04:21,799 --> 00:04:24,460
underneath so that's going to be
underneath there we now put glue on this

106
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:24,470
underneath there we now put glue on this

107
00:04:24,470 --> 00:04:34,860
underneath there we now put glue on this
bottom end

108
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:34,870


109
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:43,360
so it's going to be like that glued into

110
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:43,370
so it's going to be like that glued into

111
00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:46,869
so it's going to be like that glued into
place so when it flips over it can flip

112
00:04:46,869 --> 00:04:46,879
place so when it flips over it can flip

113
00:04:46,879 --> 00:04:53,920
place so when it flips over it can flip
like that and just make sure when it's

114
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:53,930
like that and just make sure when it's

115
00:04:53,930 --> 00:04:58,749
like that and just make sure when it's
in it's going to be like that this is

116
00:04:58,749 --> 00:04:58,759
in it's going to be like that this is

117
00:04:58,759 --> 00:05:18,409
in it's going to be like that this is
going to stick on there

118
00:05:18,409 --> 00:05:18,419


119
00:05:18,419 --> 00:05:22,460
just make sure this works as you pull it

120
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:22,470
just make sure this works as you pull it

121
00:05:22,470 --> 00:05:27,689
just make sure this works as you pull it
comes up and flips over slightly off my

122
00:05:27,689 --> 00:05:27,699
comes up and flips over slightly off my

123
00:05:27,699 --> 00:05:31,140
comes up and flips over slightly off my
sticking so that's all working all right

124
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:31,150
sticking so that's all working all right

125
00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:32,490
sticking so that's all working all right
my measuring is slightly off so I'm

126
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:32,500
my measuring is slightly off so I'm

127
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:33,990
my measuring is slightly off so I'm
going to trim that off in a minute but

128
00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:34,000
going to trim that off in a minute but

129
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,760
going to trim that off in a minute but
first I'm gonna stick these two ends

130
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:35,770
first I'm gonna stick these two ends

131
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:39,210
first I'm gonna stick these two ends
down and the other thing is you need a

132
00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:39,220
down and the other thing is you need a

133
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:41,820
down and the other thing is you need a
slip like this one that the strip is

134
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:41,830
slip like this one that the strip is

135
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:44,550
slip like this one that the strip is
going to go through so that it can be

136
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:44,560
going to go through so that it can be

137
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,320
going to go through so that it can be
held in place and move nicely so I'll

138
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:46,330
held in place and move nicely so I'll

139
00:05:46,330 --> 00:05:49,710
held in place and move nicely so I'll
just mark where that's going to go so

140
00:05:49,710 --> 00:05:49,720
just mark where that's going to go so

141
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:55,230
just mark where that's going to go so
it's about here before I fold it down

142
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:55,240
it's about here before I fold it down

143
00:05:55,240 --> 00:06:07,020
it's about here before I fold it down
I'll just cut that slit now we can feed

144
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:07,030
I'll just cut that slit now we can feed

145
00:06:07,030 --> 00:06:20,180
I'll just cut that slit now we can feed
that through and glue these bits down

146
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:20,190


147
00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:38,390
I have made a bit of a mess you can see

148
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:38,400
I have made a bit of a mess you can see

149
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:41,060
I have made a bit of a mess you can see
I've got glue everywhere my measuring is

150
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:41,070
I've got glue everywhere my measuring is

151
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:43,400
I've got glue everywhere my measuring is
slightly off so I'll just snip a little

152
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:43,410
slightly off so I'll just snip a little

153
00:06:43,410 --> 00:06:48,040
slightly off so I'll just snip a little
bit of that blue off so it disappears

154
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:48,050


155
00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:51,260
there we go and there you got this flip

156
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:51,270
there we go and there you got this flip

157
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:55,520
there we go and there you got this flip
over flat last thing you can actually

158
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:55,530
over flat last thing you can actually

159
00:06:55,530 --> 00:06:58,820
over flat last thing you can actually
trim this this tail end down so push it

160
00:06:58,820 --> 00:06:58,830
trim this this tail end down so push it

161
00:06:58,830 --> 00:07:01,730
trim this this tail end down so push it
in it's going to extend out like that so

162
00:07:01,730 --> 00:07:01,740
in it's going to extend out like that so

163
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:04,010
in it's going to extend out like that so
with it pushed in you can just trim it

164
00:07:04,010 --> 00:07:04,020
with it pushed in you can just trim it

165
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:06,800
with it pushed in you can just trim it
off so you just have a little bit there
