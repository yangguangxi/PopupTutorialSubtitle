00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:37,510
this tutorial is about using the

2
00:00:37,510 --> 00:00:37,520
this tutorial is about using the

3
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:41,500
this tutorial is about using the
qualities of the v-fold to create extra

4
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:41,510
qualities of the v-fold to create extra

5
00:00:41,510 --> 00:00:45,880
qualities of the v-fold to create extra
tall structures as the v-fold closes it

6
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:45,890
tall structures as the v-fold closes it

7
00:00:45,890 --> 00:00:47,770
tall structures as the v-fold closes it
folds down forwards when you have a

8
00:00:47,770 --> 00:00:47,780
folds down forwards when you have a

9
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:50,319
folds down forwards when you have a
floating plane built onto it that comes

10
00:00:50,319 --> 00:00:50,329
floating plane built onto it that comes

11
00:00:50,329 --> 00:00:52,419
floating plane built onto it that comes
down nearer to the page and so then you

12
00:00:52,419 --> 00:00:52,429
down nearer to the page and so then you

13
00:00:52,429 --> 00:00:53,799
down nearer to the page and so then you
can build another view fold on it

14
00:00:53,799 --> 00:00:53,809
can build another view fold on it

15
00:00:53,809 --> 00:00:56,470
can build another view fold on it
pointing in the other direction and that

16
00:00:56,470 --> 00:00:56,480
pointing in the other direction and that

17
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:58,509
pointing in the other direction and that
comes down taking another floating plane

18
00:00:58,509 --> 00:00:58,519
comes down taking another floating plane

19
00:00:58,519 --> 00:01:00,849
comes down taking another floating plane
again lower to the page then you can

20
00:01:00,849 --> 00:01:00,859
again lower to the page then you can

21
00:01:00,859 --> 00:01:02,439
again lower to the page then you can
build onto that and so you can build a

22
00:01:02,439 --> 00:01:02,449
build onto that and so you can build a

23
00:01:02,449 --> 00:01:05,670
build onto that and so you can build a
sort of zigzag effect by building these

24
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:05,680
sort of zigzag effect by building these

25
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:09,100
sort of zigzag effect by building these
reverse pointing B folds so this is a

26
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:09,110
reverse pointing B folds so this is a

27
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:11,980
reverse pointing B folds so this is a
pretty crude version I made and I'll

28
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:11,990
pretty crude version I made and I'll

29
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:13,480
pretty crude version I made and I'll
show you how I made this in a minute but

30
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:13,490
show you how I made this in a minute but

31
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:15,490
show you how I made this in a minute but
before that I just like to run through

32
00:01:15,490 --> 00:01:15,500
before that I just like to run through

33
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:18,249
before that I just like to run through
some books that have really amazingly

34
00:01:18,249 --> 00:01:18,259
some books that have really amazingly

35
00:01:18,259 --> 00:01:22,149
some books that have really amazingly
tall default structures in them first

36
00:01:22,149 --> 00:01:22,159
tall default structures in them first

37
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:23,950
tall default structures in them first

00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:43,310
floating plane here which has got other

53
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:45,880
floating plane here which has got other
v-folds built on it it's hard to

54
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:45,890
v-folds built on it it's hard to

55
00:01:45,890 --> 00:01:48,969
v-folds built on it it's hard to
actually see into it but here you can

56
00:01:48,969 --> 00:01:48,979
actually see into it but here you can

57
00:01:48,979 --> 00:01:51,999
actually see into it but here you can
see this is another V fold and the arms

58
00:01:51,999 --> 00:01:52,009
see this is another V fold and the arms

59
00:01:52,009 --> 00:01:54,069
see this is another V fold and the arms
are attached to those planes jutting out

60
00:01:54,069 --> 00:01:54,079
are attached to those planes jutting out

61
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:56,410
are attached to those planes jutting out
and this at the very top well you can

62
00:01:56,410 --> 00:01:56,420
and this at the very top well you can

63
00:01:56,420 --> 00:02:00,580
and this at the very top well you can
see this is a v-fold with another V fold

64
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:00,590
see this is a v-fold with another V fold

65
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:02,950
see this is a v-fold with another V fold
on top of it and then this the face is a

66
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:02,960
on top of it and then this the face is a

67
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:06,830
on top of it and then this the face is a
parallel foam so yeah nice design

68
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:06,840
parallel foam so yeah nice design

69
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:09,660
parallel foam so yeah nice design

this is a really extraordinary tall
structure that there's no way we could

74
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:16,000
structure that there's no way we could

75
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,760
structure that there's no way we could
explain it in this tutorial but I just

76
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:17,770
explain it in this tutorial but I just

77
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:19,770
explain it in this tutorial but I just
thought you'd really like to see this

78
00:02:19,770 --> 00:02:19,780
thought you'd really like to see this

79
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:22,920
thought you'd really like to see this

the bubble page if we look at the

82
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:26,950
the bubble page if we look at the

83
00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:29,760
the bubble page if we look at the
structure behind that you can see it is

84
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:29,770
structure behind that you can see it is

85
00:02:29,770 --> 00:02:32,190
structure behind that you can see it is
a v-fold here raising a floating plane

86
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:32,200
a v-fold here raising a floating plane

87
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:36,110
a v-fold here raising a floating plane
here but the the actual measurements the

88
00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:36,120
here but the the actual measurements the

89
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:38,520
here but the the actual measurements the
measurements at this side and this side

and on these days is quite complicated

92
00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:41,500
and on these days is quite complicated

93
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:46,050
and on these days is quite complicated

future work so we'll explain it and then

97
00:02:49,269 --> 00:02:51,780
future work so we'll explain it and then
we've got this one this is another book

comes up really high above the page this

104
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:03,010
comes up really high above the page this

105
00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:04,110

is a v-fold

106
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:04,120
is a v-fold

107
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:06,990

these are parallelograms being raised by

108
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:07,000
these are parallelograms being raised by

109
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,539
these are parallelograms being raised by
it you look behind and you can see it's

110
00:03:09,539 --> 00:03:09,549
it you look behind and you can see it's

111
00:03:09,549 --> 00:03:12,569
it you look behind and you can see it's
an array of parallelograms and people

112
00:03:12,569 --> 00:03:12,579
an array of parallelograms and people

113
00:03:12,579 --> 00:03:15,479
an array of parallelograms and people
raising this floating plane which has

114
00:03:15,479 --> 00:03:15,489
raising this floating plane which has

115
00:03:15,489 --> 00:03:16,620
raising this floating plane which has
got another v-fold

116
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:16,630
got another v-fold

117
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:18,599
got another v-fold
and another so that's how you get this

118
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:18,609
and another so that's how you get this

119
00:03:18,609 --> 00:03:21,210
and another so that's how you get this
sort of constant interaction that's all

120
00:03:21,210 --> 00:03:21,220
sort of constant interaction that's all

121
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:23,940
sort of constant interaction that's all
based on the fact that the v-fold folds

122
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:23,950
based on the fact that the v-fold folds

123
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:26,009
based on the fact that the v-fold folds
down forwards which gives you a plane

124
00:03:26,009 --> 00:03:26,019
down forwards which gives you a plane

125
00:03:26,019 --> 00:03:28,080
down forwards which gives you a plane
that you can then build on and go higher

126
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:28,090
that you can then build on and go higher

127
00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:29,490
that you can then build on and go higher
and higher so you end up with a

128
00:03:29,490 --> 00:03:29,500
and higher so you end up with a

129
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:32,280
and higher so you end up with a
structure which is higher than the total

130
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:32,290
structure which is higher than the total

131
00:03:32,290 --> 00:03:35,310
structure which is higher than the total
height of the page of the book so the

132
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:35,320
height of the page of the book so the

133
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:36,810
height of the page of the book so the
next one this is a very pretty little

134
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:36,820
next one this is a very pretty little

135
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:39,990
next one this is a very pretty little

showed you but it's even more

166
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:15,870
showed you but it's even more

167
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:18,349
showed you but it's even more
extraordinary height that you get

168
00:04:18,349 --> 00:04:18,359
extraordinary height that you get

169
00:04:18,359 --> 00:04:21,529
extraordinary height that you get
this proverb again it's based on v-folds

170
00:04:21,529 --> 00:04:21,539
this proverb again it's based on v-folds

171
00:04:21,539 --> 00:04:24,559
this proverb again it's based on v-folds
default folding forward giving you this

172
00:04:24,559 --> 00:04:24,569
default folding forward giving you this

00:04:24,569 --> 00:04:26,659
default folding forward giving you this
equivalent of a floating playing with

00:04:26,669 --> 00:04:29,089
equivalent of a floating playing with
another befall built onto it but it's a

176
00:04:29,089 --> 00:04:29,099
another befall built onto it but it's a

177
00:04:29,099 --> 00:04:30,529
another befall built onto it but it's a
bit more complicated and sophisticated

178
00:04:30,529 --> 00:04:30,539
bit more complicated and sophisticated

179
00:04:30,539 --> 00:04:34,219
bit more complicated and sophisticated
than that so that's that one this is all

180
00:04:34,219 --> 00:04:34,229
than that so that's that one this is all

I wanted to show you in books and then

182
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:36,030
I wanted to show you in books and then

183
00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:37,550
I wanted to show you in books and then
I'll just show you how to make a sort of

184
00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:37,560
I'll just show you how to make a sort of

185
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:45,110
I'll just show you how to make a sort of
simplified version of one of these we

186
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:45,120
simplified version of one of these we

187
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:48,170
simplified version of one of these we
start with a base sheet very thoroughly

188
00:04:48,170 --> 00:04:48,180
start with a base sheet very thoroughly

189
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:51,649
start with a base sheet very thoroughly
creased and then I've got these pre-cut

190
00:04:51,649 --> 00:04:51,659
creased and then I've got these pre-cut

191
00:04:51,659 --> 00:04:54,290
creased and then I've got these pre-cut
new folds these are I think it was

192
00:04:54,290 --> 00:04:54,300
new folds these are I think it was

193
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:57,830
new folds these are I think it was
tutorial two it's the right angle V fold

194
00:04:57,830 --> 00:04:57,840
tutorial two it's the right angle V fold

195
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,140
tutorial two it's the right angle V fold
so they're just crease down the middle

196
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:00,150
so they're just crease down the middle

197
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:01,939
so they're just crease down the middle
they're both 90 degrees at the bottom

198
00:05:01,939 --> 00:05:01,949
they're both 90 degrees at the bottom

199
00:05:01,949 --> 00:05:04,520
they're both 90 degrees at the bottom
tabs on the top and bottom we're going

200
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:04,530
tabs on the top and bottom we're going

201
00:05:04,530 --> 00:05:06,290
tabs on the top and bottom we're going
to stick it on here and the whole thing

202
00:05:06,290 --> 00:05:06,300
to stick it on here and the whole thing

203
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:08,839
to stick it on here and the whole thing
is going to fold forward and there's

204
00:05:08,839 --> 00:05:08,849
is going to fold forward and there's

205
00:05:08,849 --> 00:05:10,279
is going to fold forward and there's
going to be another one in front of it

206
00:05:10,279 --> 00:05:10,289
going to be another one in front of it

207
00:05:10,289 --> 00:05:12,920
going to be another one in front of it
so the whole thing can fall forwards and

208
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:12,930
so the whole thing can fall forwards and

209
00:05:12,930 --> 00:05:15,469
so the whole thing can fall forwards and
hold a floating plane on top of it and

210
00:05:15,469 --> 00:05:15,479
hold a floating plane on top of it and

211
00:05:15,479 --> 00:05:18,589
hold a floating plane on top of it and
you can get the maximum movement is the

212
00:05:18,589 --> 00:05:18,599
you can get the maximum movement is the

213
00:05:18,599 --> 00:05:21,140
you can get the maximum movement is the
closer you go to 90 degrees to the spine

214
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:21,150
closer you go to 90 degrees to the spine

215
00:05:21,150 --> 00:05:23,570
closer you go to 90 degrees to the spine
the more movement you'll get and the

216
00:05:23,570 --> 00:05:23,580
the more movement you'll get and the

217
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:26,059
the more movement you'll get and the
flash little going but if you go at 90

218
00:05:26,059 --> 00:05:26,069
flash little going but if you go at 90

219
00:05:26,069 --> 00:05:27,260
flash little going but if you go at 90
degrees to the spine the whole thing

220
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:27,270
degrees to the spine the whole thing

221
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:29,450
degrees to the spine the whole thing
just falls flat so you can't go at 90

222
00:05:29,450 --> 00:05:29,460
just falls flat so you can't go at 90

223
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:31,550
just falls flat so you can't go at 90
degrees you have to go up something like

224
00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:31,560
degrees you have to go up something like

225
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:34,610
degrees you have to go up something like
85 something like that with all these

226
00:05:34,610 --> 00:05:34,620
85 something like that with all these

227
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:43,159
85 something like that with all these
you start by sticking down one side so

228
00:05:43,159 --> 00:05:43,169
you start by sticking down one side so

229
00:05:43,169 --> 00:05:45,709
you start by sticking down one side so
I'm going as close to 90 degrees as I

230
00:05:45,709 --> 00:05:45,719
I'm going as close to 90 degrees as I

231
00:05:45,719 --> 00:05:48,740
I'm going as close to 90 degrees as I
can 90 degrees to the spine stick it

232
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:48,750
can 90 degrees to the spine stick it

233
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:57,499
can 90 degrees to the spine stick it
down fold it shut fold the base shut and

234
00:05:57,499 --> 00:05:57,509
down fold it shut fold the base shut and

235
00:05:57,509 --> 00:06:00,290
down fold it shut fold the base shut and
find its natural sticking position so

236
00:06:00,290 --> 00:06:00,300
find its natural sticking position so

237
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:03,529
find its natural sticking position so
that's the first V Bolt and we want the

238
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:03,539
that's the first V Bolt and we want the

239
00:06:03,539 --> 00:06:05,839
that's the first V Bolt and we want the
next one it needs to be stuck down

240
00:06:05,839 --> 00:06:05,849
next one it needs to be stuck down

241
00:06:05,849 --> 00:06:08,779
next one it needs to be stuck down
parallel to it and so I'll just use this

242
00:06:08,779 --> 00:06:08,789
parallel to it and so I'll just use this

243
00:06:08,789 --> 00:06:10,189
parallel to it and so I'll just use this
little piece of card to give me a

244
00:06:10,189 --> 00:06:10,199
little piece of card to give me a

245
00:06:10,199 --> 00:06:14,269
little piece of card to give me a
guaranteed parallel line to stick it to

246
00:06:14,269 --> 00:06:14,279
guaranteed parallel line to stick it to

247
00:06:14,279 --> 00:06:18,950
guaranteed parallel line to stick it to
there's the line we just stick down one

248
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:18,960
there's the line we just stick down one

249
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:29,459
there's the line we just stick down one
side I'll keep that for future reference

250
00:06:29,459 --> 00:06:29,469


251
00:06:29,469 --> 00:06:34,270
so we stick that to the spline again to

252
00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:34,280
so we stick that to the spline again to

253
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:38,080
so we stick that to the spline again to
the line with the central crease

254
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:38,090
the line with the central crease

255
00:06:38,090 --> 00:06:41,200
the line with the central crease
with the spine fold it closed we have to

256
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:41,210
with the spine fold it closed we have to

257
00:06:41,210 --> 00:06:43,059
with the spine fold it closed we have to
be quite careful here because we've got

258
00:06:43,059 --> 00:06:43,069
be quite careful here because we've got

259
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:51,990
be quite careful here because we've got
the other one already in place so

260
00:06:51,990 --> 00:06:52,000


261
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,909
there's two identical V folds and now we

262
00:06:54,909 --> 00:06:54,919
there's two identical V folds and now we

263
00:06:54,919 --> 00:06:57,129
there's two identical V folds and now we
can put a floating plane in above those

264
00:06:57,129 --> 00:06:57,139
can put a floating plane in above those

265
00:06:57,139 --> 00:07:00,219
can put a floating plane in above those
so just take one of these pieces it

266
00:07:00,219 --> 00:07:00,229
so just take one of these pieces it

267
00:07:00,229 --> 00:07:03,820
so just take one of these pieces it
should be about right you can always

268
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:03,830
should be about right you can always

269
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:06,159
should be about right you can always
trim these down after you stuck them on

270
00:07:06,159 --> 00:07:06,169
trim these down after you stuck them on

271
00:07:06,169 --> 00:07:08,920
trim these down after you stuck them on
so you just have to place about the

272
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:08,930
so you just have to place about the

273
00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:16,409
so you just have to place about the
right size with a crease down the middle

274
00:07:16,409 --> 00:07:16,419


275
00:07:16,419 --> 00:07:21,459
crease it really well make sure that

276
00:07:21,459 --> 00:07:21,469
crease it really well make sure that

277
00:07:21,469 --> 00:07:23,980
crease it really well make sure that
it's going to fit onto all those four

278
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:23,990
it's going to fit onto all those four

279
00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:26,200
it's going to fit onto all those four
tabs and you can put glue on the ball at

280
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:26,210
tabs and you can put glue on the ball at

281
00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:44,570
tabs and you can put glue on the ball at
the same time so put this into place

282
00:07:44,570 --> 00:07:44,580


283
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:47,639
fold it shout to make sure that it's all

284
00:07:47,639 --> 00:07:47,649
fold it shout to make sure that it's all

285
00:07:47,649 --> 00:07:58,079
fold it shout to make sure that it's all
working nicely there we go so that's the

286
00:07:58,079 --> 00:07:58,089
working nicely there we go so that's the

287
00:07:58,089 --> 00:08:01,439
working nicely there we go so that's the
first plating plane as it closes you see

288
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:01,449
first plating plane as it closes you see

289
00:08:01,449 --> 00:08:03,689
first plating plane as it closes you see
that it goes down and it's given us

290
00:08:03,689 --> 00:08:03,699
that it goes down and it's given us

291
00:08:03,699 --> 00:08:05,609
that it goes down and it's given us
between that crease and the outer edge

292
00:08:05,609 --> 00:08:05,619
between that crease and the outer edge

293
00:08:05,619 --> 00:08:07,319
between that crease and the outer edge
we've got that much space to play with

294
00:08:07,319 --> 00:08:07,329
we've got that much space to play with

295
00:08:07,329 --> 00:08:09,809
we've got that much space to play with
so now we can build another layer onto

296
00:08:09,809 --> 00:08:09,819
so now we can build another layer onto

297
00:08:09,819 --> 00:08:10,679
so now we can build another layer onto
that one

298
00:08:10,679 --> 00:08:10,689
that one

299
00:08:10,689 --> 00:08:12,869
that one
so this time we'll make the V file space

300
00:08:12,869 --> 00:08:12,879
so this time we'll make the V file space

301
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:14,459
so this time we'll make the V file space
the opposite way so they're going to be

302
00:08:14,459 --> 00:08:14,469
the opposite way so they're going to be

303
00:08:14,469 --> 00:08:19,559
the opposite way so they're going to be
facing this way these previous tabs

304
00:08:19,559 --> 00:08:19,569
facing this way these previous tabs

305
00:08:19,569 --> 00:08:22,739
facing this way these previous tabs
I've had them facing back towards so

306
00:08:22,739 --> 00:08:22,749
I've had them facing back towards so

307
00:08:22,749 --> 00:08:25,290
I've had them facing back towards so
that means the best way to be looking at

308
00:08:25,290 --> 00:08:25,300
that means the best way to be looking at

309
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:28,259
that means the best way to be looking at
this structure is from that so this time

310
00:08:28,259 --> 00:08:28,269
this structure is from that so this time

311
00:08:28,269 --> 00:08:29,999
this structure is from that so this time
I'm going to make the tabs again

312
00:08:29,999 --> 00:08:30,009
I'm going to make the tabs again

313
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:32,159
I'm going to make the tabs again
although the V is pointing this way I'm

314
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:32,169
although the V is pointing this way I'm

315
00:08:32,169 --> 00:08:34,409
although the V is pointing this way I'm
going to make the tabs point towards me

316
00:08:34,409 --> 00:08:34,419
going to make the tabs point towards me

317
00:08:34,419 --> 00:08:37,379
going to make the tabs point towards me
as well so that you get a better visual

318
00:08:37,379 --> 00:08:37,389
as well so that you get a better visual

319
00:08:37,389 --> 00:08:39,480
as well so that you get a better visual
when you look at it so I'll stick this

320
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:39,490
when you look at it so I'll stick this

321
00:08:39,490 --> 00:08:53,720
when you look at it so I'll stick this
one on stick down one slide close it

322
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:53,730


323
00:08:53,730 --> 00:08:56,750
that's the beginning of the second layer

324
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:56,760
that's the beginning of the second layer

325
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:59,760
that's the beginning of the second layer
this one needs to be again stuck down

326
00:08:59,760 --> 00:08:59,770
this one needs to be again stuck down
