00:00:33,809 --> 00:00:37,259
this card is a pop-up house that can be

4
00:00:37,259 --> 00:00:37,269
this card is a pop-up house that can be

5
00:00:37,269 --> 00:00:39,000
this card is a pop-up house that can be
used either as a birthday card or a

6
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:39,010
used either as a birthday card or a

7
00:00:39,010 --> 00:00:41,790
used either as a birthday card or a
moving house cards or anything else you

8
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:41,800
moving house cards or anything else you

9
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:44,130
moving house cards or anything else you
might think of it's based on the right

10
00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:44,140
might think of it's based on the right

11
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:48,540
might think of it's based on the right
angle v-fold and the parallelogram so if

12
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:48,550
angle v-fold and the parallelogram so if

13
00:00:48,550 --> 00:00:51,299
angle v-fold and the parallelogram so if
we look at this this is the underlying

14
00:00:51,299 --> 00:00:51,309
we look at this this is the underlying

15
00:00:51,309 --> 00:00:54,119
we look at this this is the underlying
structure you'll see as it opens and

16
00:00:54,119 --> 00:00:54,129
structure you'll see as it opens and

17
00:00:54,129 --> 00:00:57,180
structure you'll see as it opens and
closes this is the right angle v-fold

18
00:00:57,180 --> 00:00:57,190
closes this is the right angle v-fold

19
00:00:57,190 --> 00:01:00,029
closes this is the right angle v-fold
and this is the parallelogram as you

20
00:01:00,029 --> 00:01:00,039
and this is the parallelogram as you

21
00:01:00,039 --> 00:01:02,160
and this is the parallelogram as you
open and close it the parallelogram

22
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:02,170
open and close it the parallelogram

23
00:01:02,170 --> 00:01:05,880
open and close it the parallelogram
lifts up all the walls twists around so

24
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:05,890
lifts up all the walls twists around so

25
00:01:05,890 --> 00:01:08,370
lifts up all the walls twists around so
fixing a roof onto it the roof can't be

00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:10,170
fixing a roof onto it the roof can't be
fixed to this two side walls as they

28
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:10,180
fixed to this two side walls as they

29
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:12,539
fixed to this two side walls as they
twist in relation to each other as it

00:01:15,359 --> 00:01:15,369
closes the only points that stay the

33
00:01:15,369 --> 00:01:16,920
closes the only points that stay the
same in relation to each other are the

34
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:16,930
same in relation to each other are the

35
00:01:16,930 --> 00:01:21,120
same in relation to each other are the
two gable ends so to add the roof you

36
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:21,130
two gable ends so to add the roof you

37
00:01:21,130 --> 00:01:23,219
two gable ends so to add the roof you
have to build a roof beam into it so if

38
00:01:23,219 --> 00:01:23,229
have to build a roof beam into it so if

39
00:01:23,229 --> 00:01:25,560
have to build a roof beam into it so if
I just lift this up you can see there's

40
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:25,570
I just lift this up you can see there's

41
00:01:25,570 --> 00:01:29,010
I just lift this up you can see there's
a roof beam that joins the two gable

42
00:01:29,010 --> 00:01:29,020
a roof beam that joins the two gable

43
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:30,779
a roof beam that joins the two gable
ends and the roof sticks onto those

44
00:01:30,779 --> 00:01:30,789
ends and the roof sticks onto those

45
00:01:30,789 --> 00:01:34,560
ends and the roof sticks onto those
nears the tabs holding the roof on for

46
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:34,570
nears the tabs holding the roof on for

47
00:01:34,570 --> 00:01:36,810
nears the tabs holding the roof on for
this you will need to measure so the

48
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:36,820
this you will need to measure so the

49
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:38,749
this you will need to measure so the
tools you'll need you'll need glue

50
00:01:38,749 --> 00:01:38,759
tools you'll need you'll need glue

51
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:42,389
tools you'll need you'll need glue
you'll need a ruler you'll need scissors

52
00:01:42,389 --> 00:01:42,399
you'll need a ruler you'll need scissors

53
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:48,239
you'll need a ruler you'll need scissors
and set square alternatively you can

54
00:01:48,239 --> 00:01:48,249
and set square alternatively you can

55
00:01:48,249 --> 00:01:50,489
and set square alternatively you can
actually use a piece of card as a set

56
00:01:50,489 --> 00:01:50,499
actually use a piece of card as a set

57
00:01:50,499 --> 00:01:53,719
actually use a piece of card as a set
square and I'll explain that in a minute

58
00:01:53,719 --> 00:01:53,729
square and I'll explain that in a minute

59
00:01:53,729 --> 00:01:57,870
square and I'll explain that in a minute
here's the template the measurements are

60
00:01:57,870 --> 00:01:57,880
here's the template the measurements are

61
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:59,520
here's the template the measurements are
I've drawn it up again here I'm going to

62
00:01:59,520 --> 00:01:59,530
I've drawn it up again here I'm going to

63
00:01:59,530 --> 00:02:01,529
I've drawn it up again here I'm going to
cut this one out in a minute so you can

64
00:02:01,529 --> 00:02:01,539
cut this one out in a minute so you can

65
00:02:01,539 --> 00:02:04,169
cut this one out in a minute so you can
see here the these lengths the short

66
00:02:04,169 --> 00:02:04,179
see here the these lengths the short

67
00:02:04,179 --> 00:02:05,580
see here the these lengths the short
walls they're four and a half

68
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:05,590
walls they're four and a half

69
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:11,020
walls they're four and a half
centimeters

70
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:11,030


71
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:18,320
the long walls are 7 centimeters

72
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:18,330


73
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:20,270
you've got a 1 centimetre tab and

74
00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:20,280
you've got a 1 centimetre tab and

75
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:22,790
you've got a 1 centimetre tab and
another one on the end here that pulls

76
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:22,800
another one on the end here that pulls

77
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,610
another one on the end here that pulls
it round and turns it into a rectangle

78
00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:25,620
it round and turns it into a rectangle

79
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:28,160
it round and turns it into a rectangle
I've drawn it up here this is the bottom

80
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:28,170
I've drawn it up here this is the bottom

81
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:30,710
I've drawn it up here this is the bottom
line you will need to score so I suppose

82
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:30,720
line you will need to score so I suppose

83
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,540
line you will need to score so I suppose
that's another tool you'll need is a

84
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:32,550
that's another tool you'll need is a

85
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:35,000
that's another tool you'll need is a
ballpoint pen or something similar and

86
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:35,010
ballpoint pen or something similar and

87
00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:38,420
ballpoint pen or something similar and
so you'll need to score along here where

88
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:38,430
so you'll need to score along here where

89
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:39,680
so you'll need to score along here where
the two tabs go

90
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:39,690
the two tabs go

91
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:42,170
the two tabs go
you'll also need to score up here where

92
00:02:42,170 --> 00:02:42,180
you'll also need to score up here where

93
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:44,120
you'll also need to score up here where
the tab pulling the whole thing into a

94
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:44,130
the tab pulling the whole thing into a

95
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:45,430
the tab pulling the whole thing into a
rectangle goes

96
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:45,440
rectangle goes

97
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:49,550
rectangle goes
you'll also need a roof beam so this

98
00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:49,560
you'll also need a roof beam so this

99
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:51,140
you'll also need a roof beam so this
roof beam I've actually made it three

100
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:51,150
roof beam I've actually made it three

101
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:52,700
roof beam I've actually made it three
centimetres high but it doesn't really

102
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:52,710
centimetres high but it doesn't really

103
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:54,620
centimetres high but it doesn't really
matter and again you'll need to score

104
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:54,630
matter and again you'll need to score

105
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:57,890
matter and again you'll need to score
here because this is a tab and here this

106
00:02:57,890 --> 00:02:57,900
here because this is a tab and here this

107
00:02:57,900 --> 00:02:59,360
here because this is a tab and here this
is a tab these are going to stick onto

108
00:02:59,360 --> 00:02:59,370
is a tab these are going to stick onto

109
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:01,760
is a tab these are going to stick onto
the gable ends and then along the top

110
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:01,770
the gable ends and then along the top

111
00:03:01,770 --> 00:03:03,680
the gable ends and then along the top
here yeah you're going to have two tabs

112
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:03,690
here yeah you're going to have two tabs

113
00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:06,110
here yeah you're going to have two tabs
here and so you'll need to score this

114
00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:06,120
here and so you'll need to score this

115
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:10,400
here and so you'll need to score this
line so that those fold down nicely so

116
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:10,410
line so that those fold down nicely so

117
00:03:10,410 --> 00:03:12,470
line so that those fold down nicely so
if you haven't got a set square you can

118
00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:12,480
if you haven't got a set square you can

119
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:15,320
if you haven't got a set square you can
use a corner of a sheet of card this is

120
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:15,330
use a corner of a sheet of card this is

121
00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:17,600
use a corner of a sheet of card this is
a 90 degree angle and so when you come

122
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:17,610
a 90 degree angle and so when you come

123
00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:19,790
a 90 degree angle and so when you come
to measuring up you will need the ruler

124
00:03:19,790 --> 00:03:19,800
to measuring up you will need the ruler

125
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,980
to measuring up you will need the ruler
to measure these distances here but you

126
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:21,990
to measure these distances here but you

127
00:03:21,990 --> 00:03:24,259
to measure these distances here but you
can then use a the corner of a piece of

128
00:03:24,259 --> 00:03:24,269
can then use a the corner of a piece of

129
00:03:24,269 --> 00:03:26,060
can then use a the corner of a piece of
cards just to give you these right

130
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:26,070
cards just to give you these right

131
00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:28,910
cards just to give you these right
angles where the uprights come and here

132
00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:28,920
angles where the uprights come and here

133
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:31,640
angles where the uprights come and here
as well so I'll just cut this out really

134
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:31,650
as well so I'll just cut this out really

135
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:33,949
as well so I'll just cut this out really
quickly you can either use a pair of

136
00:03:33,949 --> 00:03:33,959
quickly you can either use a pair of

137
00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:36,890
quickly you can either use a pair of
scissors or you can use a craft life

138
00:03:36,890 --> 00:03:36,900
scissors or you can use a craft life

139
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:39,320
scissors or you can use a craft life
like this so I find craft knives are the

140
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:39,330
like this so I find craft knives are the

141
00:03:39,330 --> 00:03:42,290
like this so I find craft knives are the
the quickest way to go I'll just cut it

142
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:42,300
the quickest way to go I'll just cut it

143
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:50,680
the quickest way to go I'll just cut it
out really fast

144
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:50,690


145
00:03:50,690 --> 00:03:53,590
so here's the basic piece for the house

146
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:53,600
so here's the basic piece for the house

147
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:57,350
so here's the basic piece for the house
make sure all these corners are really

148
00:03:57,350 --> 00:03:57,360
make sure all these corners are really

149
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:57,950
make sure all these corners are really
well

150
00:03:57,950 --> 00:03:57,960
well

151
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:00,350
well
creased as always just fold them

152
00:04:00,350 --> 00:04:00,360
creased as always just fold them

153
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:02,030
creased as always just fold them
backwards and forwards fold them on

154
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:02,040
backwards and forwards fold them on

155
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:03,710
backwards and forwards fold them on
themselves crease them again and again

156
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:03,720
themselves crease them again and again

157
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:06,500
themselves crease them again and again
so that they all move really comfortably

158
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:06,510
so that they all move really comfortably

159
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:12,160
so that they all move really comfortably
when the pop-up is opening and closing

160
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:12,170


161
00:04:12,170 --> 00:04:15,740
and also crease the tabs really

162
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:15,750
and also crease the tabs really

163
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:19,160
and also crease the tabs really
thoroughly and then I've scored it all

164
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:19,170
thoroughly and then I've scored it all

165
00:04:19,170 --> 00:04:21,650
thoroughly and then I've scored it all
with a barrow with ink in it ideally

166
00:04:21,650 --> 00:04:21,660
with a barrow with ink in it ideally

167
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:23,330
with a barrow with ink in it ideally
you'd use a ballpoint pen with knowing

168
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:23,340
you'd use a ballpoint pen with knowing

169
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:25,040
you'd use a ballpoint pen with knowing
but as it has got ink in it you've got

170
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:25,050
but as it has got ink in it you've got

171
00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:27,530
but as it has got ink in it you've got
these lines so when you fold it into the

172
00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:27,540
these lines so when you fold it into the

173
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:30,200
these lines so when you fold it into the
half shape make sure those folded lines

174
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:30,210
half shape make sure those folded lines

175
00:04:30,210 --> 00:04:34,640
half shape make sure those folded lines
are inside and also this tab that's

176
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:34,650
are inside and also this tab that's

177
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:36,470
are inside and also this tab that's
holding it all together you put that on

178
00:04:36,470 --> 00:04:36,480
holding it all together you put that on

179
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:44,560
holding it all together you put that on
the inside just put some glue on that

180
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:44,570


181
00:04:44,570 --> 00:04:47,360
once you've glued it make sure that the

182
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:47,370
once you've glued it make sure that the

183
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:50,450
once you've glued it make sure that the
whole thing will actually lie flat so

184
00:04:50,450 --> 00:04:50,460
whole thing will actually lie flat so

185
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:53,990
whole thing will actually lie flat so
you can try it both ways and then you'll

186
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:54,000
you can try it both ways and then you'll

187
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:01,040
you can try it both ways and then you'll
need a base sheet so fold it in half

188
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:01,050
need a base sheet so fold it in half

189
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:08,000
need a base sheet so fold it in half
crease it really thoroughly again and on

190
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:08,010
crease it really thoroughly again and on

191
00:05:08,010 --> 00:05:11,950
crease it really thoroughly again and on
this you need to be sure that the tabs

192
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:11,960
this you need to be sure that the tabs

193
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:16,460
this you need to be sure that the tabs
both up 45 degrees to the spine you

194
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:16,470
both up 45 degrees to the spine you

195
00:05:16,470 --> 00:05:17,960
both up 45 degrees to the spine you
don't stick it on corner to corner

196
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:17,970
don't stick it on corner to corner

197
00:05:17,970 --> 00:05:20,600
don't stick it on corner to corner
you have to have it 45 degrees to the

198
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:20,610
you have to have it 45 degrees to the

199
00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:24,469
you have to have it 45 degrees to the
spine so again you can either use a set

200
00:05:24,469 --> 00:05:24,479
spine so again you can either use a set

201
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:28,360
spine so again you can either use a set
square to give you the the guide lines

202
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:28,370
square to give you the the guide lines

203
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:31,250
square to give you the the guide lines
like this just draw them on so you know

204
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:31,260
like this just draw them on so you know

205
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:32,480
like this just draw them on so you know
where you're going to be sticking it

206
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:32,490
where you're going to be sticking it

207
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:35,659
where you're going to be sticking it
down or again you can use a corner like

208
00:05:35,659 --> 00:05:35,669
down or again you can use a corner like

209
00:05:35,669 --> 00:05:37,490
down or again you can use a corner like
this from a piece of card so that you

210
00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:37,500
this from a piece of card so that you

211
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:39,950
this from a piece of card so that you
know this is a 90 degree fold so fold

212
00:05:39,950 --> 00:05:39,960
know this is a 90 degree fold so fold

213
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:42,950
know this is a 90 degree fold so fold
that in half so the edges are next to

214
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:42,960
that in half so the edges are next to

215
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,870
that in half so the edges are next to
each other that will give you two

216
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:44,880
each other that will give you two

217
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:48,730
each other that will give you two
45-degree poles so then you can put that

218
00:05:48,730 --> 00:05:48,740
45-degree poles so then you can put that

219
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:51,469
45-degree poles so then you can put that
in line up the fold with the central

220
00:05:51,469 --> 00:05:51,479
in line up the fold with the central

221
00:05:51,479 --> 00:05:53,540
in line up the fold with the central
crease and you can use that to mark

222
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:53,550
crease and you can use that to mark

223
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:54,640
crease and you can use that to mark
where you're going

224
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:54,650
where you're going

225
00:05:54,650 --> 00:05:56,530
where you're going
since it's all measured up you can

226
00:05:56,530 --> 00:05:56,540
since it's all measured up you can

227
00:05:56,540 --> 00:05:58,270
since it's all measured up you can
actually stick both sides down at the

228
00:05:58,270 --> 00:05:58,280
actually stick both sides down at the

229
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:00,960
actually stick both sides down at the
same time make sure that the tabs

230
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:00,970
same time make sure that the tabs

231
00:06:00,970 --> 00:06:03,640
same time make sure that the tabs
holding it down that when it's in

232
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:03,650
holding it down that when it's in

233
00:06:03,650 --> 00:06:05,680
holding it down that when it's in
position they don't overlap so on this

234
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:05,690
position they don't overlap so on this

235
00:06:05,690 --> 00:06:07,870
position they don't overlap so on this
you can see they're slightly big so I'm

236
00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:07,880
you can see they're slightly big so I'm

237
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:10,330
you can see they're slightly big so I'm
just going to snip an extra piece off

238
00:06:10,330 --> 00:06:10,340
just going to snip an extra piece off

239
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:17,730
just going to snip an extra piece off
those so they don't overlap on the spine

240
00:06:17,730 --> 00:06:17,740


241
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:20,080
now we can stick them both down at the

242
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:20,090
now we can stick them both down at the

243
00:06:20,090 --> 00:06:25,810
now we can stick them both down at the
same time as always with glue the

244
00:06:25,810 --> 00:06:25,820
same time as always with glue the

245
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:28,030
same time as always with glue the
creases are the important thing so you

246
00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:28,040
creases are the important thing so you

247
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:30,040
creases are the important thing so you
make sure that the glue goes right up to

248
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:30,050
make sure that the glue goes right up to

249
00:06:30,050 --> 00:06:32,760
make sure that the glue goes right up to
the creases and then you can position it

250
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:32,770
the creases and then you can position it

251
00:06:32,770 --> 00:06:35,590
the creases and then you can position it
so both those creases are on those

252
00:06:35,590 --> 00:06:35,600
so both those creases are on those

253
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:39,070
so both those creases are on those
guidelines and then as with all pop ups

254
00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:39,080
guidelines and then as with all pop ups

255
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:40,660
guidelines and then as with all pop ups
fold it shut

256
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:40,670
fold it shut

257
00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:42,670
fold it shut
press it down firmly just to make sure

258
00:06:42,670 --> 00:06:42,680
press it down firmly just to make sure

259
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:46,210
press it down firmly just to make sure
that it's stuck down soundly so there's

260
00:06:46,210 --> 00:06:46,220
that it's stuck down soundly so there's

261
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:49,960
that it's stuck down soundly so there's
the beginning of the house now you've

262
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:49,970
the beginning of the house now you've

263
00:06:49,970 --> 00:06:52,120
the beginning of the house now you've
got the roof beam make sure all the

264
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:52,130
got the roof beam make sure all the

265
00:06:52,130 --> 00:06:54,280
got the roof beam make sure all the
creases are really well reinforced

266
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:54,290
creases are really well reinforced

267
00:06:54,290 --> 00:06:57,130
creases are really well reinforced
folding backwards and forwards and then

268
00:06:57,130 --> 00:06:57,140
folding backwards and forwards and then

269
00:06:57,140 --> 00:06:58,870
folding backwards and forwards and then
the important thing with this when you

270
00:06:58,870 --> 00:06:58,880
the important thing with this when you

271
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,550
the important thing with this when you
stick it in it's going to stick into the

272
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:00,560
stick it in it's going to stick into the

273
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:04,210
stick it in it's going to stick into the
gable ends these creases they have to be

274
00:07:04,210 --> 00:07:04,220
gable ends these creases they have to be

275
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:06,580
gable ends these creases they have to be
vertical so you can stick them both at

276
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:06,590
vertical so you can stick them both at

277
00:07:06,590 --> 00:07:09,700
vertical so you can stick them both at
the same time and just make sure the

278
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:09,710
the same time and just make sure the

279
00:07:09,710 --> 00:07:12,370
the same time and just make sure the
creases are coming up vertically up to

280
00:07:12,370 --> 00:07:12,380
creases are coming up vertically up to

281
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:14,200
creases are coming up vertically up to
the very tips of the gable ends and

282
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:14,210
the very tips of the gable ends and

283
00:07:14,210 --> 00:07:16,750
the very tips of the gable ends and
again we can put glue on both of those

284
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:16,760
again we can put glue on both of those

285
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:20,170
again we can put glue on both of those
at the same time I don't think it

286
00:07:20,170 --> 00:07:20,180
at the same time I don't think it

287
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:21,880
at the same time I don't think it
actually makes any difference but I'm

288
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:21,890
actually makes any difference but I'm

289
00:07:21,890 --> 00:07:23,500
actually makes any difference but I'm
going to have one pointing one way and

290
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:23,510
going to have one pointing one way and

291
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:25,060
going to have one pointing one way and
one pointing the other way just to give

292
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:25,070
one pointing the other way just to give

293
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:29,530
one pointing the other way just to give
it some symmetry and again make sure

294
00:07:29,530 --> 00:07:29,540
it some symmetry and again make sure

295
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:31,690
it some symmetry and again make sure
that the glue goes right up to the

296
00:07:31,690 --> 00:07:31,700
that the glue goes right up to the

297
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:34,600
that the glue goes right up to the
crease and then you you can just put

298
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:34,610
crease and then you you can just put

299
00:07:34,610 --> 00:07:42,990
crease and then you you can just put
that in place like that and like this

300
00:07:42,990 --> 00:07:43,000


301
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,660
make sure the the crease for these two

302
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:46,670
make sure the the crease for these two

303
00:07:46,670 --> 00:07:52,690
make sure the the crease for these two
top ones is up against the top and again

304
00:07:52,690 --> 00:07:52,700
top ones is up against the top and again

305
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:54,750
top ones is up against the top and again
we'll just shut it to make sure

306
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:54,760
we'll just shut it to make sure

307
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:56,860
we'll just shut it to make sure
everything's in place and that the whole

308
00:07:56,860 --> 00:07:56,870
everything's in place and that the whole

309
00:07:56,870 --> 00:07:59,350
everything's in place and that the whole
thing is found

310
00:07:59,350 --> 00:07:59,360
thing is found

311
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:02,270
thing is found
there it is and then when we put the

312
00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:02,280
there it is and then when we put the

313
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:05,660
there it is and then when we put the
roof on this is going to go down each of

314
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:05,670
roof on this is going to go down each of

315
00:08:05,670 --> 00:08:06,920
roof on this is going to go down each of
these when it's going to go one weight

316
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:06,930
these when it's going to go one weight

317
00:08:06,930 --> 00:08:10,430
these when it's going to go one weight
and one is going to go the other way so

318
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:10,440
and one is going to go the other way so

319
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:12,500
and one is going to go the other way so
this is the roof piece it's got a crease

320
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:12,510
this is the roof piece it's got a crease

321
00:08:12,510 --> 00:08:14,890
this is the roof piece it's got a crease
down the middle make sure that's really

322
00:08:14,890 --> 00:08:14,900
down the middle make sure that's really

323
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:20,240
down the middle make sure that's really
well folded well enforced the dimensions

324
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:20,250
well folded well enforced the dimensions

325
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:22,310
well folded well enforced the dimensions
the length of the roof this will be

326
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:22,320
the length of the roof this will be

327
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:27,560
the length of the roof this will be
going along here this is 8,5 centimeters

328
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:27,570
going along here this is 8,5 centimeters

329
00:08:27,570 --> 00:08:32,620
going along here this is 8,5 centimeters
and the width of the roof it's 5,5 and

330
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:32,630
and the width of the roof it's 5,5 and

331
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:36,260
and the width of the roof it's 5,5 and
5,5 so this is going down the slope of

332
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:36,270
5,5 so this is going down the slope of

333
00:08:36,270 --> 00:08:39,760
5,5 so this is going down the slope of
the roof so we'll just fold that in half

334
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:39,770
the roof so we'll just fold that in half

335
00:08:39,770 --> 00:08:43,280
the roof so we'll just fold that in half
the other point with these is as the

336
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:43,290
the other point with these is as the

337
00:08:43,290 --> 00:08:46,820
the other point with these is as the
base closes the corners of the roof have

338
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:46,830
base closes the corners of the roof have

339
00:08:46,830 --> 00:08:49,730
base closes the corners of the roof have
a tendency to dag into the page so I

340
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:49,740
a tendency to dag into the page so I

341
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:53,150
a tendency to dag into the page so I
just ran them off so you can do that

342
00:08:53,150 --> 00:08:53,160
just ran them off so you can do that

343
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:55,220
just ran them off so you can do that
with it fold it in half just round them

344
00:08:55,220 --> 00:08:55,230
with it fold it in half just round them

345
00:08:55,230 --> 00:09:00,650
with it fold it in half just round them
off so that it can move more easily and

346
00:09:00,650 --> 00:09:00,660
off so that it can move more easily and

347
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:03,710
off so that it can move more easily and
then put the glue on your two roof beam

348
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:03,720
then put the glue on your two roof beam

349
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:13,760
then put the glue on your two roof beam
tabs even here and then you have to just

350
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:13,770
tabs even here and then you have to just

351
00:09:13,770 --> 00:09:19,040
tabs even here and then you have to just
position the roof by eye I'll just smear

352
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:19,050
position the roof by eye I'll just smear

353
00:09:19,050 --> 00:09:24,650

00:09:59,600 --> 00:09:59,610
between the corner of the house and the

373
00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:03,670
between the corner of the house and the
base here that needs to be 6 centimeters

374
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:03,680
base here that needs to be 6 centimeters

375
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:07,229

just in

376
00:10:07,229 --> 00:10:07,239
just in

377
00:10:07,239 --> 00:10:15,100

that's a six so the house basically it's

378
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:15,110
that's a six so the house basically it's

379
00:10:15,110 --> 00:10:18,100
that's a six so the house basically it's
a parallelogram and in this case it's a

380
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:18,110
a parallelogram and in this case it's a

381
00:10:18,110 --> 00:10:20,710
a parallelogram and in this case it's a
parallelogram built onto a v-fold but

382
00:10:20,710 --> 00:10:20,720
parallelogram built onto a v-fold but

383

there's other ways you can play with it

384
00:10:22,869 --> 00:10:22,879
there's other ways you can play with it

385
00:10:22,879 --> 00:10:25,449
there's other ways you can play with it
so in this example rather than building

386
00:10:25,449 --> 00:10:25,459
so in this example rather than building

387
00:10:25,459 --> 00:10:27,429
so in this example rather than building
it onto a right angle v-fold

388
00:10:27,429 --> 00:10:27,439
it onto a right angle v-fold

389
00:10:27,439 --> 00:10:29,829
it onto a right angle v-fold
you can build it onto a zigzag fold like

390
00:10:29,829 --> 00:10:29,839
you can build it onto a zigzag fold like

391
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:32,979
you can build it onto a zigzag fold like
this zigzag fold is tutorial 20 and

392
00:10:32,979 --> 00:10:32,989
this zigzag fold is tutorial 20 and

393
00:10:32,989 --> 00:10:35,350
this zigzag fold is tutorial 20 and
again the houses are the same they've

394
00:10:35,350 --> 00:10:35,360
again the houses are the same they've

395
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:38,259
again the houses are the same they've
got the roof beams underneath I'll just

396
00:10:38,259 --> 00:10:38,269
got the roof beams underneath I'll just

397
00:10:38,269 --> 00:10:42,280
got the roof beams underneath I'll just
show you a zigzag fold this is a zigzag

398
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:42,290
show you a zigzag fold this is a zigzag

399
00:10:42,290 --> 00:10:44,799
show you a zigzag fold this is a zigzag
fold which is an uneven one based on a

400
00:10:44,799 --> 00:10:44,809
fold which is an uneven one based on a

401
00:10:44,809 --> 00:10:48,609
fold which is an uneven one based on a
parallelogram this is the regular zigzag

402
00:10:48,609 --> 00:10:48,619
parallelogram this is the regular zigzag

403
00:10:48,619 --> 00:10:52,090
parallelogram this is the regular zigzag
fold so here it is it gives you three

404
00:10:52,090 --> 00:10:52,100
fold so here it is it gives you three

405
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:54,129
fold so here it is it gives you three
gullies that you can build into you can

406
00:10:54,129 --> 00:10:54,139
gullies that you can build into you can

407
00:10:54,139 --> 00:10:57,819
gullies that you can build into you can
build in here here and here so in this

408
00:10:57,819 --> 00:10:57,829
build in here here and here so in this

409
00:10:57,829 --> 00:10:59,799
build in here here and here so in this
case the house doesn't stick down to the

410
00:10:59,799 --> 00:10:59,809
case the house doesn't stick down to the

411
00:10:59,809 --> 00:11:01,720
case the house doesn't stick down to the
base the house sticks into the exact

412
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:01,730
base the house sticks into the exact

413
00:11:01,730 --> 00:11:06,819
base the house sticks into the exact
order houses I'll just explain this one

414
00:11:06,819 --> 00:11:06,829
order houses I'll just explain this one

in this case the dimensions are

416
00:11:09,249 --> 00:11:09,259
in this case the dimensions are

417
00:11:09,259 --> 00:11:11,769
in this case the dimensions are
different it is based on a parallelogram

418
00:11:11,769 --> 00:11:11,779
different it is based on a parallelogram

419
00:11:11,779 --> 00:11:14,289
different it is based on a parallelogram
in this case the places it sticks down

420
00:11:14,289 --> 00:11:14,299
in this case the places it sticks down

421
00:11:14,299 --> 00:11:16,539
in this case the places it sticks down
they both point at the same point on the

422
00:11:16,539 --> 00:11:16,549
they both point at the same point on the

423
00:11:16,549 --> 00:11:18,999
they both point at the same point on the
spine and then this distance from this

424
00:11:18,999 --> 00:11:19,009
spine and then this distance from this

425
00:11:19,009 --> 00:11:21,429
spine and then this distance from this
corner to the spine is the same as this

the walls of the house and so that means

450
00:11:53,079 --> 00:11:53,089
the walls of the house and so that means

451
00:11:53,089 --> 00:11:55,659
