添加到所有折痕中

11
00:00:49,089 --> 00:00:52,500
is how the em fold goes it's basically
an acute V fold with acute v-folds built
那是教程22，所以这是M折

00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:52,510
an acute V fold with acute v-folds built
加上猫和折痕给您

13
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:54,869
an acute V fold with acute v-folds built
into the gullies but all made in one so
这些反折可以给您更多

14
00:00:54,869 --> 00:00:54,879
into the gullies but all made in one so
可以像

15
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:58,500
into the gullies but all made in one so
this is tutorial 19 and then in actual
这你会看到所有的小

16
00:00:58,500 --> 00:00:58,510
this is tutorial 19 and then in actual
不同的飞机得到了这些武器

17
00:00:58,510 --> 00:01:01,139
this is tutorial 19 and then in actual
fact that as counter folds added to it
用心和东西粘在他们身上

18
00:01:01,139 --> 00:01:01,149
fact that as counter folds added to it
最后，我将向您展示如何

19
00:01:01,149 --> 00:01:03,360
fact that as counter folds added to it
added into all the creases
很快就成为其中之一

20
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:03,370
added into all the creases
对折的基片

21
00:01:03,370 --> 00:01:06,510
added into all the creases
that's tutorial 22 so here's an M fold
完全弄皱了，这将是

22
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:06,520
that's tutorial 22 so here's an M fold
M折，所以我们再次将其折入

23
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:10,289
that's tutorial 22 so here's an M fold
with added cats and creases giving you
半

24
00:01:10,289 --> 00:01:10,299
with added cats and creases giving you
我们从大约

25
00:01:10,299 --> 00:01:11,760
with added cats and creases giving you
these counter folds that give you more
这样的事情的三分之一

26
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:11,770
these counter folds that give you more
像这样折回两侧

27
00:01:11,770 --> 00:01:16,499
these counter folds that give you more
planes that can all be extended like
所以我们有两个角度，你打开

28
00:01:16,499 --> 00:01:16,509
planes that can all be extended like
它在那下面的每一侧向上倾斜

29
00:01:16,509 --> 00:01:19,020
planes that can all be extended like
this you'll see that all the little
点他们都是一样的，然后你

30
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:19,030
this you'll see that all the little
只需将它的一侧折叠起来

31
00:01:19,030 --> 00:01:20,520
this you'll see that all the little
different planes have got these arms
折痕一定要远离

32
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:20,530
different planes have got these arms
脊椎一定不能到同一点

33
00:01:20,530 --> 00:01:22,469
different planes have got these arms
stuck onto them with hearts and stuff on
其他所有

34
00:01:22,469 --> 00:01:22,479
stuck onto them with hearts and stuff on
是我所以你只是把它折叠起来

35
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:24,510
stuck onto them with hearts and stuff on
the end so I'll just show you how to
像这样的东西折叠回来

36
00:01:24,510 --> 00:01:24,520
the end so I'll just show you how to
本身，然后在另一边

37
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:28,560
the end so I'll just show you how to
make one of those really quickly here's
不必与我们可以一样

38
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:28,570
make one of those really quickly here's
折起来，我们再次创造它倾斜

39
00:01:28,570 --> 00:01:31,440
make one of those really quickly here's
a base sheet folded in half
远离中间折线

40
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:31,450
a base sheet folded in half
回到自己，现在我们可以

41
00:01:31,450 --> 00:01:36,389
a base sheet folded in half
creased really thoroughly this will be
六角琴，所以这些褶皱来了

42
00:01:36,389 --> 00:01:36,399
creased really thoroughly this will be
向前棘手，我们在那里，然后

43
00:01:36,399 --> 00:01:39,120
creased really thoroughly this will be
the M fold so again we just fold it in
像这样折起来

44
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:39,130
the M fold so again we just fold it in
折起所有这些将成为您的M折

45
00:01:39,130 --> 00:01:40,010
the M fold so again we just fold it in
half
我会稍微修剪一下

46
00:01:40,010 --> 00:01:40,020
half
太大

47
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:45,109
half
we cut a wedge out of the up to about
就这样回来了

48
00:01:45,109 --> 00:01:45,119
we cut a wedge out of the up to about
现在我们的柜台都折叠了

49
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:48,260
we cut a wedge out of the up to about
third of the way up something like that
这些折痕，我什至可以做到

50
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:48,270
third of the way up something like that
稍低一点，因为我们要

51
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:53,630
third of the way up something like that
fold the two sides back like this
必须做握住心灵的手臂

52
00:01:53,630 --> 00:01:53,640
fold the two sides back like this
会突出很多

53
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:57,779
fold the two sides back like this
so we've got the two angles and you open
在任何这些折痕上都像这样

54
00:01:57,779 --> 00:01:57,789
so we've got the two angles and you open
你可以再剪一些折

55
00:01:57,789 --> 00:02:00,450
so we've got the two angles and you open
it up the angles on each side below that
在自己身上，然后再次推动

56
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:00,460
it up the angles on each side below that
通过，所以我们又产生了两个

57
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:02,639
it up the angles on each side below that
point they're both the same and then you
那里可以添加东西的飞机

58
00:02:02,639 --> 00:02:02,649
point they're both the same and then you
给他们这个也许我们不会削减

59
00:02:02,649 --> 00:02:06,660
point they're both the same and then you
just take one side fold it up now this
如果你看的话，我们会把它折叠起来

60
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:06,670
just take one side fold it up now this
教程22您将看到所有

61
00:02:06,670 --> 00:02:08,969
just take one side fold it up now this
crease must be leaning out away from the
您可以添加计数器的不同方式

62
00:02:08,969 --> 00:02:08,979
crease must be leaning out away from the
折叠到弹出窗口上的折痕

63
00:02:08,979 --> 00:02:11,610
crease must be leaning out away from the
spine it mustn't come to the same point
我们去

64
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:11,620
spine it mustn't come to the same point
所以你有一些其他的东西

65
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:12,430
spine it mustn't come to the same point
where all the other
以及

66
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:12,440
where all the other
因此产生了更多的飞机

67
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:14,640
where all the other
is me so you just have it folding up
可以扩展，所以现在我将

68
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:14,650
is me so you just have it folding up
坚持下去这是一个页面

69
00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:19,780
is me so you just have it folding up
something like this fold that back on
基本的锐角v折就是

70
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:19,790
something like this fold that back on
这一切的核心，随着页面的关闭

71
00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:24,700
something like this fold that back on
itself and then on the other side it
这将向前折叠，所以你想要

72
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:24,710
itself and then on the other side it
该页面位于页面顶部附近

73
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:26,560
itself and then on the other side it
doesn't have to be the same we can just
和所有这些事情一样

74
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:26,570
doesn't have to be the same we can just
确保角度匹配我们刚放的

75
00:02:26,570 --> 00:02:30,100
doesn't have to be the same we can just
fold it up and again we creat it leaning
一侧的胶水先粘下来

76
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:30,110
fold it up and again we creat it leaning
中央折痕与

77
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:34,930
fold it up and again we creat it leaning
out away from the middle fold so fold
基本卡上的中央折痕可以

78
00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:34,940
out away from the middle fold so fold
看看你认为会看到你的角度

79
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:38,800
out away from the middle fold so fold
that back on itself and now we can
坐好，这对我来说看起来不错

80
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:38,810
that back on itself and now we can
然后把它折下来，关上胶水

81
00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:41,910
that back on itself and now we can
concertina this so these folds come
其他选项卡始终将其涂抹

82
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:41,920
concertina this so these folds come
折痕粘到折痕是

83
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:46,690
concertina this so these folds come
forward tricky there we are and then
实际的重要方面

84
00:02:46,690 --> 00:02:46,700
forward tricky there we are and then
外边缘并不重要

85
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:50,710
forward tricky there we are and then
fold that back when it comes like this
然后我们关闭发现的基地

86
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:50,720
fold that back when it comes like this
它的自然黏附位置

87
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:55,330
fold that back when it comes like this
crease it all this will be your M fold
您现在可以开始

88
00:02:55,330 --> 00:02:55,340
crease it all this will be your M fold
只是这些小碎片和小武器，

89
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:57,520
crease it all this will be your M fold
I'll just trim it down a bit it's a bit
你可以把它们伸出来

90
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:57,530
I'll just trim it down a bit it's a bit
真的有任何角度，所以你只要把它们

91
00:02:57,530 --> 00:02:58,600
I'll just trim it down a bit it's a bit
too big
这样说

92
00:02:58,600 --> 00:02:58,610
too big
这样，您需要每次检查

93
00:02:58,610 --> 00:03:04,390
too big
that's it back something like this and
经常，当您将它们添加到

94
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:04,400
that's it back something like this and
确保他们不会

95
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,760
that's it back something like this and
now we have the counter folds into all
该地方关闭时发生冲突，所以我们关闭了

96
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:06,770
now we have the counter folds into all
这和你是的，到目前为止很好

97
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:10,060
now we have the counter folds into all
these creases I might even make that
这样我们就出来了

98
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:10,070
these creases I might even make that
在我实际割下的手臂上加一下手臂

99
00:03:10,070 --> 00:03:11,890
these creases I might even make that
slightly lower because we're going to
所有这些笔直的他们可能会弯曲

100
00:03:11,890 --> 00:03:11,900
slightly lower because we're going to
但是你可以出来这样说

101
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:14,110
slightly lower because we're going to
have to do the arms that hold the hearts
您开始创建一个相当

102
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:14,120
have to do the arms that hold the hearts
复杂有趣的几乎

103
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:16,210
have to do the arms that hold the hearts
will be jutting out quite a lot sort of
的网络，但这只是一系列的武器

104
00:03:16,210 --> 00:03:16,220
will be jutting out quite a lot sort of
伸出来，然后可以添加

105
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:19,510
will be jutting out quite a lot sort of
stake like that on any of these creases
我会再次检查的心

106
00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:19,520
stake like that on any of these creases
确保一切都好，而且不断

107
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:22,990
stake like that on any of these creases
you can have extra cuts fold them back
认为你没有我就知道了

108
00:03:22,990 --> 00:03:23,000
you can have extra cuts fold them back
必然需要建立更多的

109
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,910
you can have extra cuts fold them back
on themselves and back again push that
这些我在这里有一些很大的心

110
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:27,920
on themselves and back again push that
但还不够，我只是把奇怪

111
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:31,390
on themselves and back again push that
through so we've generated two more
一个就可以了

112
00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:31,400
through so we've generated two more
印象，所以把胶水放在手臂上

113
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:33,460
through so we've generated two more
planes there that can have things added
而不是在你心中

114
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:33,470
planes there that can have things added
粘上你总是把胶水

115
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:35,650
planes there that can have things added
to them this one maybe we won't cut it
最小的表面而不是更大的表面

116
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:35,660
to them this one maybe we won't cut it
工作，所以我认为这可能是

117
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:39,070
to them this one maybe we won't cut it
we'll just fold it if you look at
足够让您了解如何

118
00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:39,080
we'll just fold it if you look at
作品

119
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:43,300
we'll just fold it if you look at
tutorial 22 you'll just see all the
然后您就可以逐步构建它，

120
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:43,310
tutorial 22 you'll just see all the
随心所欲地保持复杂

121
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:45,009
tutorial 22 you'll just see all the
different ways that you can add counter
检查，它将像这样工作

122
00:03:45,009 --> 00:03:45,019
different ways that you can add counter
而且他们不会与之发生冲突

123
00:03:45,019 --> 00:03:55,440
different ways that you can add counter
folds to the creases on the pop-up
彼此表示武器不会

124


纠结起来，然后你实际上可以

125
00:03:55,450 --> 00:04:00,870
there we go
在其他各种类型上使用此技术

126


基本的机制，所以这里有一个

127
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:03,280
so you have things some on this other
这是基于一种扭曲

128
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:03,290
so you have things some on this other
机制，这是教程17

129
00:04:03,290 --> 00:04:15,449
so you have things some on this other
side as well
卡还不够弯曲

130


应该就这样消失了，但是

131
00:04:15,459 --> 00:04:20,140
so generated quite a few more planes
我真的很感兴趣，这就是全部

132
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:20,150
so generated quite a few more planes
不同的手臂，上面贴着一朵花

133
00:04:20,150 --> 00:04:22,270
so generated quite a few more planes
that can be extended so now I'll just
结束，所以这是一个例子

134
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:22,280
that can be extended so now I'll just
的

135
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:25,120
that can be extended so now I'll just
stick this down to the page this is a
当你打开它的机制

136
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:25,130
stick this down to the page this is a
六架飞机，这里有两架

137
00:04:25,130 --> 00:04:28,060
stick this down to the page this is a
basic acute angle v-fold that's the
然后在下面有两个

138
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:28,070
basic acute angle v-fold that's the
在这里，所以任何人都可以拥有武器

139
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:30,640
basic acute angle v-fold that's the
heart of it all and as the page closes
伸出鲜花或心形

140
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:30,650
heart of it all and as the page closes
卡在最后你也可以

141
00:04:30,650 --> 00:04:32,620
heart of it all and as the page closes
that's going to fold forward so you want
如果你有一个反极

142
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:32,630
that's going to fold forward so you want
额外的切割，你可以弯曲下来

143
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:34,360
that's going to fold forward so you want
this to be up near the top of your page
向后弯曲，将其推过，如此

144

这是教程20的曲折

150
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:53,750
the glue on one side first stick it down
我已经削减了一些

151
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:56,860
the glue on one side first stick it down
with this central crease flush with the
本来是这样的

152
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:56,870
with this central crease flush with the
然后我增加了额外的削减

153
00:04:56,870 --> 00:05:00,160
with this central crease flush with the

00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:29,570
and then we shut the base which finds
不必实际卡在

171
00:05:29,570 --> 00:05:34,780
and then we shut the base which finds
its natural sticking position that's

your starting point now you can take
只要关闭它，确保一切正常

175
00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:40,300
your starting point now you can take
just these little pieces little arms and
我已经在这里烦死了

176
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:40,310
just these little pieces little arms and
超出边缘，但这就是事实

181
00:05:46,970 --> 00:05:55,870
any angle really so you just put them
say like this
您了解基本技术

182


我在这里用过另一种类型的

183
00:05:55,880 --> 00:06:04,130
like that and you need to check it every
机制，这是基于

184
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:04,140
like that and you need to check it every
传播罗伯茨一本佛教著作《爱丽丝》

185
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:06,140
like that and you need to check it every
so often and as you add them just to

186
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:06,150
so often and as you add them just to
提升小3D形状的艺术

187
00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:08,170
so often and as you add them just to
make sure they're not going to be
他们实际上是被卡住的矩形吗

188
00:06:08,170 --> 00:06:08,180
make sure they're not going to be
放在他们身上，但他们可以一样容易

189
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:11,990
make sure they're not going to be
clashing as the place closes so we shut
是心，我只向你展示那一个

尽头是拱门

193
00:06:33,130 --> 00:06:39,400
there we go coming out like this you can
提出这些小的3D形状，然后

194
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:39,410
there we go coming out like this you can
扑克牌全都卡住了

195
00:06:39,410 --> 00:06:42,279
there we go coming out like this you can
add arms on to arms I've actually cut
他们创造了一个非常惊人的混乱

196
00:06:42,279 --> 00:06:42,289
add arms on to arms I've actually cut
效果这是我在这里所做的是

197
00:06:42,289 --> 00:06:43,900
add arms on to arms I've actually cut
all these straight they could be curved
类似的东西正在创造一个

198
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:43,910
all these straight they could be curved
这可能是心中的混乱效应

199
00:06:43,910 --> 00:06:47,279
all these straight they could be curved
but you could come out say like this so
关闭时显然很粗糙

200
00:06:47,279 --> 00:06:47,289
but you could come out say like this so
你可以看到他们都伸出来了

201
00:06:47,289 --> 00:06:49,810
but you could come out say like this so
you're starting to create quite a
我需要再做一个边缘

202
00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:49,820
you're starting to create quite a
考虑到一切

203
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:53,770
you're starting to create quite a
complicated interesting sort of almost
缩小尺寸，使其停留在底部，因此

204
00:06:53,770 --> 00:06:53,780
complicated interesting sort of almost
实际上没有关于如何

205
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:56,020

of web but it's just an array of arms
做一个拱门，所以我只告诉你

206
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:56,030
of web but it's just an array of arms
快速地制作拱形，这样你

207
00:06:56,030 --> 00:06:57,700
of web but it's just an array of arms
sticking out that you can then add the
可以建立

208
00:06:57,700 --> 00:06:57,710
sticking out that you can then add the
这是您的基本表

209
00:06:57,710 --> 00:07:10,810
sticking out that you can then add the
hearts to I'll just check again make
要建立一个基本上是急性的

210
00:07:10,810 --> 00:07:10,820
hearts to I'll just check again make
建立在其上的角度v形折叠

211
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:18,279
hearts to I'll just check again make
sure that it's all okay and on and on I
所以我们把一半折成两半

212
00:07:18,279 --> 00:07:18,289
sure that it's all okay and on and on I
这就是教程中的全部内容-如何制作

213
00:07:18,289 --> 00:07:20,080
sure that it's all okay and on and on I
think you get the idea without me
锐角折好折

214
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:20,090
think you get the idea without me
这是折痕，所以你

215
00:07:20,090 --> 00:07:24,129
think you get the idea without me
necessarily needing to to build more of
将它折成一点角度

216
00:07:24,129 --> 00:07:24,139
necessarily needing to to build more of
请看清楚，然后剪下

217
00:07:24,139 --> 00:07:27,370
necessarily needing to to build more of
these I got some quite big hearts here
下来制作几个粘合标签

218
00:07:27,370 --> 00:07:27,380
these I got some quite big hearts here
这将粘在后面

219
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:30,610
these I got some quite big hearts here
but not really enough I just put the odd
像这样的页面，但您希望它成为

220
00:07:30,610 --> 00:07:30,620
but not really enough I just put the odd
拱门，所以如果你只是剪拱门的话

221
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:33,870
but not really enough I just put the odd
one on so you can get the basic
离开然后随机粘贴

222
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:33,880
one on so you can get the basic
可能会使其有点扭曲

223
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:44,800
one on so you can get the basic
impression so put the glue on the arms
形状不是很稳定，所以您

224
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:44,810
impression so put the glue on the arms
首先需要你算出什么

225
00:07:44,810 --> 00:07:46,900
impression so put the glue on the arms
rather than on the hearts when you're
您想要基本弹出窗口的角度

226
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:46,910
rather than on the hearts when you're
但是你为什么还要走更多

227
00:07:46,910 --> 00:07:48,250
rather than on the hearts when you're
gluing you always put the glue on the
它会躺下来，你变得更狭窄

228
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:48,260
gluing you always put the glue on the
在底座上，它会站立得更多，所以

229
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:52,830
gluing you always put the glue on the
smallest surface rather than the larger
现在一样会这样

230


您需要在一侧标记角度

231
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:55,210
working so I think that's probably
它粘在哪里，所以拿一支铅笔

232
00:07:55,210 --> 00:07:55,220
working so I think that's probably
在这里我标记了这个角度，然后

233
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:57,070
working so I think that's probably
enough so you get the idea of how it
真正重要的是，您还标记了

234
00:07:57,070 --> 00:07:57,080
enough so you get the idea of how it
边缘的末端，所以这是线

235
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:57,760
enough so you get the idea of how it
works
这是真正的结束

236
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:57,770
works
关键的事情现在你可以剪弓

237
00:07:57,770 --> 00:07:59,860
works
and you can just build it up and up and
出来，所以我们将像

238
00:07:59,860 --> 00:07:59,870
and you can just build it up and up and
这个

239
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:02,200
and you can just build it up and up and
up as complicated as you like just keep
我要去之前我坚持下去

240
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:02,210
up as complicated as you like just keep
我要再折一次

241
00:08:02,210 --> 00:08:04,600
up as complicated as you like just keep
checking and it's gonna work like this
只是在顶部，所以给它一个

242
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:04,610
checking and it's gonna work like this
我觉得佛陀多一点兴趣

243
00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:07,029
checking and it's gonna work like this
and that they aren't gonna clash with
在他的《爱丽丝梦游仙境》示例中

244
00:08:07,029 --> 00:08:07,039
and that they aren't gonna clash with
不，这是我们要坚持的

245
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:08,500
and that they aren't gonna clash with
each other that the arms aren't going to
扎根于基地，因此重要

246
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:08,510
each other that the arms aren't going to
事情是你坚持减少反对

247
00:08:08,510 --> 00:08:11,980
each other that the arms aren't going to
tangle up and and snag you can actually
线，你把外面的边缘

248
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:11,990
tangle up and and snag you can actually
反对那个标志，所以你知道

249
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:14,260
tangle up and and snag you can actually
use this technique on all sorts of other
第一次测试时的确切位置

250
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:14,270
use this technique on all sorts of other
所以把胶水放在线的一侧

251
00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:20,490
use this technique on all sorts of other
basic mechanisms so there's one here
进入最后的标记，然后您可以

252
00:08:20,490 --> 00:08:20,500
basic mechanisms so there's one here
把整个东西都关上，放上胶水

253
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,870
basic mechanisms so there's one here
this one is based on a twisting
另一个标签并关闭底座

254
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:22,880
this one is based on a twisting
这是你现在可以做的弓形

255
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:26,050
this one is based on a twisting
mechanism which is tutorial 17 this bit
像你一样将其他部分重新构建

256
00:08:26,050 --> 00:08:26,060
mechanism which is tutorial 17 this bit
关闭它，你会看到这是一个假人

257
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:28,360
mechanism which is tutorial 17 this bit
hasn't quite work the cards too bendy it
那些突出的片段无关紧要

258
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:28,370
hasn't quite work the cards too bendy it
我们不妨修剪一下

259
00:08:28,370 --> 00:08:30,250
hasn't quite work the cards too bendy it
should have gone gone like that but what
只是他们都适合基地

260
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:30,260
should have gone gone like that but what
请现在关闭它，没关系

261
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:32,380
should have gone gone like that but what
I'm really interested in here is all the
现在我们将添加一些小块

262
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:32,390
I'm really interested in here is all the
因此，最简单的方法就是

263
00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:35,050
I'm really interested in here is all the
different arms with a flower stuck onto
采取绝对最简单的方法

264
00:08:35,050 --> 00:08:35,060
different arms with a flower stuck onto
这只是将标签折叠到一端

265
00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:37,839
different arms with a flower stuck onto
the end of it so this is an example of
在上面放胶

266
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:37,849
the end of it so this is an example of
折叠成一个循环，这样你就可以循环

267
00:08:37,849 --> 00:08:38,580
the end of it so this is an example of
the
这样，然后压扁

268
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:38,590
the
再将它对半折叠

269
00:08:38,590 --> 00:08:41,159
the
mechanism when you open that up it's got
现在，当您打开它时，它会重新回到自身

270
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:41,169
mechanism when you open that up it's got
你有一个正方形，所以你

271
00:08:41,169 --> 00:08:43,380
mechanism when you open that up it's got
six planes it's got two on the top here
可以把它粘到那个沟渠里

272
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:43,390
six planes it's got two on the top here
拱加入页面，在此之前

273
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:45,510
six planes it's got two on the top here
then it's got two underneath here and
再次，我将添加几个小柜台

274
00:08:45,510 --> 00:08:45,520
then it's got two underneath here and
褶皱我会在那儿做个切口

275
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:48,090
then it's got two underneath here and
here and so any of those can have arms
向后弯，现在就推

276
00:08:48,090 --> 00:08:48,100
here and so any of those can have arms
这不只是产生一个

277
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:50,670
here and so any of those can have arms
sticking out with flowers or hearts
我们已经产生了另外两架飞机

278
00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:50,680
sticking out with flowers or hearts
您可以粘贴的额外四架飞机

279
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:52,230
sticking out with flowers or hearts
stuck on the end you can also make
多余的胶水整体上

280
00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:52,240
stuck on the end you can also make
很多

281
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,050
stuck on the end you can also make
counter poles of these if you have a
确保此折痕紧贴

282
00:08:54,050 --> 00:08:54,060
counter poles of these if you have a
那沟壑就在那里，然后我们将

283
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:57,420
counter poles of these if you have a
extra cut there you can bend this down
关闭底座并按好它，使

284
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:57,430
extra cut there you can bend this down
如果我们再做一次的话，那一定能奏效

285
00:08:57,430 --> 00:09:01,440
extra cut there you can bend this down
bend it back push that through and so
我会在另一边做类似的事情

286
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:01,450
bend it back push that through and so
向您展示制作它的另一种方式

287
00:09:01,450 --> 00:09:02,670
bend it back push that through and so
again there you are you've created
这次只是想出一个角度

288
00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:02,680
again there you are you've created
在这种情况下，我们不需要这么大的一块

289
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:04,590
again there you are you've created
another two planes so you can do that
我不会使其完整循环

290
00:09:04,590 --> 00:09:04,600
another two planes so you can do that
我会做这样的事

291
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:07,650
another two planes so you can do that
all over it and end up creating
折成一半的折痕

292
00:09:07,650 --> 00:09:07,660
all over it and end up creating
所以可能就像那对标签

293
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:11,490
all over it and end up creating
something like this other mechanisms
这将像这样粘在上面

294
00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:11,500
something like this other mechanisms
所以它向中间倾斜

295
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:14,760
something like this other mechanisms
that you can use of the zigzag fold so
或者你实际上可以拥有另一个

296
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:14,770
that you can use of the zigzag fold so
这样它实际上就从

297
00:09:14,770 --> 00:09:18,170
that you can use of the zigzag fold so
this is tutorial 20 is a zigzag fold
我认为在这种情况下我很中间

00:09:18,170 --> 00:09:18,180
this is tutorial 20 is a zigzag fold
像它向中间倾斜一样

299
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:21,810
this is tutorial 20 is a zigzag fold
I've made a couple of cuts as it stood
这不是这样的循环，所以你已经

300
00:09:21,810 --> 00:09:21,820
I've made a couple of cuts as it stood
有折痕放入沟渠中

301
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:24,780
I've made a couple of cuts as it stood
originally it would have been like this
必须测量它，所以您只需将其放入

302
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:24,790
originally it would have been like this
这样，中央的折痕

303
00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:27,240
originally it would have been like this
and then I've added extra cuts increases
基地紧紧地扎在那沟里

304
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:27,250
and then I've added extra cuts increases
只是标记出其中一个折痕所在

305
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:30,030
and then I've added extra cuts increases
so it's generating more planes and you
在底座上只是标记它的末端，这样

306
00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:30,040
so it's generating more planes and you
您要确保确切知道

307
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:32,519
so it's generating more planes and you
can take these little arms and you can
一块去，现在你翻转它

308
00:09:32,519 --> 00:09:32,529
can take these little arms and you can
结束，所以我把折痕放到那个沟里

309
00:09:32,529 --> 00:09:48,950
can take these little arms and you can
stick them on shutting up shutting out
现在你要把它翻转过来

310


像这样坚持下去，我会

311
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:53,910
coming up at odd angles again every time
放一些胶水，你只在一侧粘

312
00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:53,920
coming up at odd angles again every time
这次我把它放在那个标记上

313
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:56,700
coming up at odd angles again every time
you add stuff shut it down I've got a
紧紧向下移动，将其粘在

314
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:56,710
you add stuff shut it down I've got a
其他标签将胶水涂抹到边缘，然后

315
00:09:56,710 --> 00:09:58,320
you add stuff shut it down I've got a
couple sticking out here those could be
然后关闭找到它的基地

316
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:58,330
couple sticking out here those could be
在地球上的自然黏附的地方

317
00:09:58,330 --> 00:10:00,600
couple sticking out here those could be
trimmed off but you just keep adding
因此，现在这两个

318
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:00,610
trimmed off but you just keep adding
这在这里创造了一个沟壑

319
00:10:00,610 --> 00:10:04,140
trimmed off but you just keep adding
arms to it building up a complicated
在这里您可以建造更多这些

320
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:04,150
arms to it building up a complicated
这些较小或相同的尺寸

321
00:10:04,150 --> 00:10:06,150
arms to it building up a complicated
array of arms that you can then stick
同样在这里您可以在其中建立更多

322
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:06,160
array of arms that you can then stick
如果我们看一下这个

323
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,310
array of arms that you can then stick
your hearts or flowers or stars or
它结束了，你可以看到那里有一个正方形

324
00:10:08,310 --> 00:10:08,320
your hearts or flowers or stars or
一个，有一个倾斜的柜台文件夹

325
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,950
your hearts or flowers or stars or
whatever you feel like onto gliding
与此相同，实际上

326
00:10:10,950 --> 00:10:10,960
whatever you feel like onto gliding
内置了三层

327
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:14,190
whatever you feel like onto gliding
around a bit I'm afraid no and then
一二三然后你就开始

328
00:10:14,190 --> 00:10:14,200
around a bit I'm afraid no and then
粘贴并粘贴

329
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:18,630
around a bit I'm afraid no and then
again you can add to those so you make a
自己，然后建立这个

330
00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:18,640
again you can add to those so you make a
一点一点哦，我还有另一种方式

331
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:21,930
again you can add to those so you make a
more complicated structure with everyone
告诉你坚持到这里

332
00:10:21,930 --> 00:10:21,940
more complicated structure with everyone
像这样折成一半你可以

333
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:26,970
more complicated structure with everyone
going back like this
你可以做一个捷径

334


把它自己折叠起来，所以我切入

335
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:32,160
I have another one coming coming down
从折痕边缘将其折叠

336
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:32,170
I have another one coming coming down
这样回来，所以这块看起来像

337
00:10:32,170 --> 00:10:36,720
I have another one coming coming down
off that one there and of course they
再次将其折叠起来

338
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:36,730
off that one there and of course they
然后当您弹出它，所以我们弹出

339
00:10:36,730 --> 00:10:38,490
off that one there and of course they
don't have to actually be stuck on the
通过这个给你

340
00:10:38,490 --> 00:10:38,500
don't have to actually be stuck on the
这样的形状，现在这是这个

341
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:43,009
don't have to actually be stuck on the
end so you can know maybe put one here
这是绝对标准的柜台

342
00:10:43,009 --> 00:10:43,019
end so you can know maybe put one here
折叠，你可以把胶水一直

343
00:10:43,019 --> 00:10:49,350
end so you can know maybe put one here
give it a t-shirt so all of these can
左右两边都很好涂

344
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:49,360
give it a t-shirt so all of these can
然后把这个折痕收紧

345
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:59,879
give it a t-shirt so all of these can
have other hearts stuck onto them again

346
00:10:59,879 --> 00:10:59,889
have other hearts stuck onto them again
这样又给你两架飞机

347
00:10:59,889 --> 00:11:02,210
have other hearts stuck onto them again
just close it make sure it's all working
玩关闭它，确保它

00:11:02,210 --> 00:11:02,220
just close it make sure it's all working
所有的作品，所以你就可以开始

349
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:04,829
just close it make sure it's all working
I've goofed here it's actually sticking
建立你的心像

350
00:11:04,829 --> 00:11:04,839
I've goofed here it's actually sticking
这个，你可以坚持下去

351
00:11:04,839 --> 00:11:06,990
I've goofed here it's actually sticking
out of the edge but that's the thing
坚持，那是心中的沐浴

352
00:11:06,990 --> 00:11:07,000
out of the edge but that's the thing
