00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:50,399
glued into them this design is based on
an acute angle V font which is covered

12
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:50,409
an acute angle V font which is covered

13
00:00:50,409 --> 00:00:57,000
an acute angle V font which is covered
in tutorial to this one this is based on

14
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:57,010
in tutorial to this one this is based on

15
00:00:57,010 --> 00:01:01,049
in tutorial to this one this is based on
a asymmetric V font which is covered in

16
00:01:01,049 --> 00:01:01,059
a asymmetric V font which is covered in

17
00:01:01,059 --> 00:01:04,410
a asymmetric V font which is covered in
tutorial 4 and so here is the asymmetric

18
00:01:04,410 --> 00:01:04,420
tutorial 4 and so here is the asymmetric

19
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:07,200
tutorial 4 and so here is the asymmetric
V fold and then it just has a ketone

20
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:07,210
V fold and then it just has a ketone

21
00:01:07,210 --> 00:01:09,959
V fold and then it just has a ketone
v-folds built into the gullies the

this case all the tabs are behind in the

28
00:01:17,999 --> 00:01:18,009
this case all the tabs are behind in the

29
00:01:18,009 --> 00:01:22,459
this case all the tabs are behind in the
model in this one there's just two tabs

model in this one there's just two tabs

31
00:01:22,469 --> 00:01:25,080
model in this one there's just two tabs
which come forward in front of the model

32
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:25,090
which come forward in front of the model

33
00:01:25,090 --> 00:01:27,599
which come forward in front of the model
and it's all just a question of design

34
00:01:27,599 --> 00:01:27,609
and it's all just a question of design

35
00:01:27,609 --> 00:01:29,399
and it's all just a question of design

used to raise another plane so this is

72
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:27,280
used to raise another plane so this is

73
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:31,740
used to raise another plane so this is
actually a parallel fold it's a curved

fold so we take a base sheet fold it in

78
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:45,430
fold so we take a base sheet fold it in

79
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:50,220
fold so we take a base sheet fold it in
half crease it well and take half a

00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:50,230
half crease it well and take half a

81
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:54,450
half crease it well and take half a
sheet and fold it in half so just fold

82
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:54,460
sheet and fold it in half so just fold

83
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:56,310
sheet and fold it in half so just fold
it in half crease it really thoroughly

84
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:56,320
it in half crease it really thoroughly

85
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:59,630
it in half crease it really thoroughly
and what what we're making here is is a

00:02:59,630 --> 00:02:59,640
and what what we're making here is is a

87
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:05,490
and what what we're making here is is a
basic V fold as we looked at in tutorial

of just starting near the bottom corner

92
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:09,790
of just starting near the bottom corner

93
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:13,410
of just starting near the bottom corner
and making two small gluing tabs we're

94
00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:13,420
and making two small gluing tabs we're

95
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:14,970
and making two small gluing tabs we're
going to start about a third of the way

96
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:14,980
going to start about a third of the way

97
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:17,490
going to start about a third of the way
up so this is the first crease start

98
00:03:17,490 --> 00:03:17,500
up so this is the first crease start

99
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:19,860
up so this is the first crease start
about a third of the way up and you have

100
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:19,870
about a third of the way up and you have

101
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:22,620
about a third of the way up and you have
a crease coming up towards the outer

102
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:22,630
a crease coming up towards the outer

103
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:24,990
a crease coming up towards the outer
edges and it doesn't really matter what

104
00:03:24,990 --> 00:03:25,000
edges and it doesn't really matter what

105
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,170
edges and it doesn't really matter what
angle you do the different angles will

106
00:03:28,170 --> 00:03:28,180
angle you do the different angles will

107
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:29,790
angle you do the different angles will
give you different shapes so if you want

108
00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:29,800
give you different shapes so if you want

109
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:32,460
give you different shapes so if you want
to want to a specific shape just play

110
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:32,470
to want to a specific shape just play

111
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:34,050
to want to a specific shape just play
around with it till you find the angle

112
00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:34,060
around with it till you find the angle

113
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:39,120
around with it till you find the angle
that you were so here it is open it up

114
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:39,130
that you were so here it is open it up

115
00:03:39,130 --> 00:03:42,030
that you were so here it is open it up
the creases all make a big downward

116
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:42,040
the creases all make a big downward

117
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:44,180
the creases all make a big downward
pointing arrow there's the creases there

118
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:44,190
pointing arrow there's the creases there

119
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:47,780
pointing arrow there's the creases there
now fold it in half and just cut a wedge

120
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:47,790
now fold it in half and just cut a wedge

121
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:50,670
now fold it in half and just cut a wedge
where all the creases meet just cut a

122
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:50,680
where all the creases meet just cut a

123
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:54,720
where all the creases meet just cut a
wedge after that so now you have this

124
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:54,730
wedge after that so now you have this

125
00:03:54,730 --> 00:03:59,100
wedge after that so now you have this
shape so now just fold up one side and

126
00:03:59,100 --> 00:03:59,110
shape so now just fold up one side and

127
00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:00,570
shape so now just fold up one side and
you're going to add another crease so

128
00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:00,580
you're going to add another crease so

129
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:03,690
you're going to add another crease so
here's your initial fold now you're

130
00:04:03,690 --> 00:04:03,700
here's your initial fold now you're

131
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:06,330
here's your initial fold now you're
coming up like this mustn't start here

132
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:06,340
coming up like this mustn't start here

133
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:08,160
coming up like this mustn't start here
at this point it's got to be somewhere

134
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:08,170
at this point it's got to be somewhere

135
00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:11,010
at this point it's got to be somewhere
along this fold line so say a third of

136
00:04:11,010 --> 00:04:11,020
along this fold line so say a third of

137
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:14,970
along this fold line so say a third of
the way and then fold it up this fold it

138
00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:14,980
the way and then fold it up this fold it

139
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:17,970
the way and then fold it up this fold it
has to be leaning away so here's your

140
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:17,980
has to be leaning away so here's your

141
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:20,670
has to be leaning away so here's your
first of all this sort of spine one and

142
00:04:20,670 --> 00:04:20,680
first of all this sort of spine one and

143
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:20,990
first of all this sort of spine one and
then

144
00:04:20,990 --> 00:04:21,000
then

145
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,390
then
to be leaning away if it leans in with

146
00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:23,400
to be leaning away if it leans in with

147
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:26,240
to be leaning away if it leans in with
that way it won't work and then fold

148
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:26,250
that way it won't work and then fold

149
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:33,470
that way it won't work and then fold
that back on itself that's one side now

150
00:04:33,470 --> 00:04:33,480
that back on itself that's one side now

151
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:35,540
that back on itself that's one side now
we'll do the other side fold it up it

152
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:35,550
we'll do the other side fold it up it

153
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:37,370
we'll do the other side fold it up it
doesn't have to be the same angle you

154
00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:37,380
doesn't have to be the same angle you

155
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:39,200
doesn't have to be the same angle you
can play around with it as long as the

156
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:39,210
can play around with it as long as the

157
00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:41,360
can play around with it as long as the
angle of the fold is leaning away from

158
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:41,370
angle of the fold is leaning away from

159
00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:44,530
angle of the fold is leaning away from
the center fold data

160
00:04:44,530 --> 00:04:44,540
the center fold data

161
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:50,230
the center fold data
crease it well fold it back on its own

162
00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:50,240
crease it well fold it back on its own

163
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:54,320
crease it well fold it back on its own
right now open it all flat so here it is

164
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:54,330
right now open it all flat so here it is

165
00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:57,740
right now open it all flat so here it is
now you concertina it so start with the

166
00:04:57,740 --> 00:04:57,750
now you concertina it so start with the

167
00:04:57,750 --> 00:04:59,390
now you concertina it so start with the
middle fold that into a mountain fold

168
00:04:59,390 --> 00:04:59,400
middle fold that into a mountain fold

169
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:01,610
middle fold that into a mountain fold
the next fold is going to be a valley

170
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:01,620
the next fold is going to be a valley

171
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:04,280
the next fold is going to be a valley
and the next one a mountain the next one

172
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:04,290
and the next one a mountain the next one

173
00:05:04,290 --> 00:05:06,950
and the next one a mountain the next one
a valley so you can concertina and the

174
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:06,960
a valley so you can concertina and the

175
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,990
a valley so you can concertina and the
same on the other side starting with the

176
00:05:08,990 --> 00:05:09,000
same on the other side starting with the

177
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,240
same on the other side starting with the
mountain fold in the middle next one's a

178
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:11,250
mountain fold in the middle next one's a

179
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:13,550
mountain fold in the middle next one's a
valley next one's a mountain next one's

00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:13,560
valley next one's a mountain next one's

181
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:17,810
valley next one's a mountain next one's
a van you just pinch it all well now you

182
00:05:17,810 --> 00:05:17,820
a van you just pinch it all well now you

183
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:19,970
a van you just pinch it all well now you
can open it up now this is going to

184
00:05:19,970 --> 00:05:19,980
can open it up now this is going to

185
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:22,640
can open it up now this is going to
stick down something like this you've

186
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:22,650
stick down something like this you've

187
00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:24,920
stick down something like this you've
got to have this central crease lined up

188
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:24,930
got to have this central crease lined up

189
00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:28,010
got to have this central crease lined up
with the central gully the whole thing

190
00:05:28,010 --> 00:05:28,020
with the central gully the whole thing

191
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:30,250
with the central gully the whole thing
as it closes it's going to fold forward

192
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:30,260
as it closes it's going to fold forward

193
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:33,050
as it closes it's going to fold forward
so the side where you want it on the

194
00:05:33,050 --> 00:05:33,060
so the side where you want it on the

195
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:34,909
so the side where you want it on the
page you can have it right up at the

196
00:05:34,909 --> 00:05:34,919
page you can have it right up at the

197
00:05:34,919 --> 00:05:36,440
page you can have it right up at the
back if you want depending on your

198
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:36,450
back if you want depending on your

199
00:05:36,450 --> 00:05:38,960
back if you want depending on your
design or you can have it quite near the

200
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:38,970
design or you can have it quite near the

201
00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:41,210
design or you can have it quite near the
front you can also have it really tight

202
00:05:41,210 --> 00:05:41,220
front you can also have it really tight

203
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:44,930
front you can also have it really tight
so you've got a really narrow Ridge in

204
00:05:44,930 --> 00:05:44,940
so you've got a really narrow Ridge in

205
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:46,909
so you've got a really narrow Ridge in
the middle or you can go wide the wider

206
00:05:46,909 --> 00:05:46,919
the middle or you can go wide the wider

207
00:05:46,919 --> 00:05:49,820
the middle or you can go wide the wider
you go the more it'll lie down and then

208
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:49,830
you go the more it'll lie down and then

209
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:51,500
you go the more it'll lie down and then
these are the mountain folds with the

210
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:51,510
these are the mountain folds with the

211
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:53,090
these are the mountain folds with the
gullies behind them that you can play

212
00:05:53,090 --> 00:05:53,100
gullies behind them that you can play

213
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:55,520
gullies behind them that you can play
with so we might just experiment with

214
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:55,530
with so we might just experiment with

215
00:05:55,530 --> 00:05:57,740
with so we might just experiment with
that before we before we stick it down

216
00:05:57,740 --> 00:05:57,750
that before we before we stick it down

217
00:05:57,750 --> 00:06:00,620
that before we before we stick it down
so they take the top one we'll just turn

218
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:00,630
so they take the top one we'll just turn

219
00:06:00,630 --> 00:06:04,010
so they take the top one we'll just turn
that into a counter phone so we fold

220
00:06:04,010 --> 00:06:04,020
that into a counter phone so we fold

221
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:07,670
that into a counter phone so we fold
that that will then push back in so now

222
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:07,680
that that will then push back in so now

223
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,860
that that will then push back in so now
we've generated two more planes that we

224
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:09,870
we've generated two more planes that we

225
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:12,440
we've generated two more planes that we
will be able to play with we could do

226
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:12,450
will be able to play with we could do

227
00:06:12,450 --> 00:06:15,590
will be able to play with we could do
the same for these next two we can just

228
00:06:15,590 --> 00:06:15,600
the same for these next two we can just

229
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:18,110
the same for these next two we can just
fold them over you have to do this

230
00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:18,120
fold them over you have to do this

231
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:20,090
fold them over you have to do this
before you stick it down it's much

232
00:06:20,090 --> 00:06:20,100
before you stick it down it's much

233
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:21,760
before you stick it down it's much
easier so there we are

234
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:21,770
easier so there we are

235
00:06:21,770 --> 00:06:25,280
easier so there we are
I've got two more planes and we can do

236
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:25,290
I've got two more planes and we can do

237
00:06:25,290 --> 00:06:27,740
I've got two more planes and we can do
the same here you can make these folds

238
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:27,750
the same here you can make these folds

239
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:29,600
the same here you can make these folds
at any angle it really doesn't matter

240
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:29,610
at any angle it really doesn't matter

241
00:06:29,610 --> 00:06:32,510
at any angle it really doesn't matter
and it's all just depends what what

242
00:06:32,510 --> 00:06:32,520
and it's all just depends what what

243
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:33,690
and it's all just depends what what
shape you're trying to

244
00:06:33,690 --> 00:06:33,700
shape you're trying to

245
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:36,720
shape you're trying to
luckily so we could we could just leave

246
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:36,730
luckily so we could we could just leave

247
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:41,880
luckily so we could we could just leave
it at that and now to glue it down you

248
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:41,890
it at that and now to glue it down you

249
00:06:41,890 --> 00:06:44,070
it at that and now to glue it down you
just you decide first of all what what

250
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:44,080
just you decide first of all what what

251
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:46,170
just you decide first of all what what
angle you want it how tight how much you

252
00:06:46,170 --> 00:06:46,180
angle you want it how tight how much you

253
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:48,000
angle you want it how tight how much you
want it standing up how much you want it

254
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:48,010
want it standing up how much you want it

255
00:06:48,010 --> 00:06:51,060
want it standing up how much you want it
lying down I'm going to go for something

256
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:51,070
lying down I'm going to go for something

257
00:06:51,070 --> 00:06:53,640
lying down I'm going to go for something
like this so these first two creases

258
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:53,650
like this so these first two creases

259
00:06:53,650 --> 00:06:56,010
like this so these first two creases
there is about 45 degrees to the spine

260
00:06:56,010 --> 00:06:56,020
there is about 45 degrees to the spine

261
00:06:56,020 --> 00:07:02,970
there is about 45 degrees to the spine
and so put glue all over one side and

262
00:07:02,970 --> 00:07:02,980
and so put glue all over one side and

263
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:08,730
and so put glue all over one side and
just glue it down like that now you fold

264
00:07:08,730 --> 00:07:08,740
just glue it down like that now you fold

265
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:16,650
just glue it down like that now you fold
it shut put glue on the other one and

266
00:07:16,650 --> 00:07:16,660
it shut put glue on the other one and

267
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:18,540
it shut put glue on the other one and
then you follow that Shutts fold the

268
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:18,550
then you follow that Shutts fold the

269
00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:20,670
then you follow that Shutts fold the
whole base shot so it finds its natural

270
00:07:20,670 --> 00:07:20,680
whole base shot so it finds its natural

271
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:23,880
whole base shot so it finds its natural
sticking position press it really firmly

272
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:23,890
sticking position press it really firmly

273
00:07:23,890 --> 00:07:27,240
sticking position press it really firmly
to make sure the gluing your sons open

go sailing this if you look you'll see

282
00:07:45,330 --> 00:07:45,340
go sailing this if you look you'll see

283
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:47,640
go sailing this if you look you'll see
this the main V fold and then it has

284
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:47,650
this the main V fold and then it has

285
00:07:47,650 --> 00:07:50,160
this the main V fold and then it has
little counter forms here that are the M

286
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:50,170
little counter forms here that are the M

287
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:52,920
little counter forms here that are the M
fold and it's got additional tentacles

288
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:52,930
fold and it's got additional tentacles

289
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:55,050
fold and it's got additional tentacles
stuck onto those so in this case the

290
00:07:55,050 --> 00:07:55,060
stuck onto those so in this case the

291
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:57,270
stuck onto those so in this case the
outer bit pieces are being used as the

00:07:57,270 --> 00:07:57,280
outer bit pieces are being used as the

293
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:00,930
outer bit pieces are being used as the
muscle to lift larger larger pieces of
