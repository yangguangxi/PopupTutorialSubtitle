parallel fold to move as you open close

4
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:39,260
parallel fold to move as you open close

5
00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:41,819
parallel fold to move as you open close
the spread here's the example as you

6
00:00:41,819 --> 00:00:41,829
the spread here's the example as you

7
00:00:41,829 --> 00:00:46,090
the spread here's the example as you
open it the flower opens and you can see

8
00:00:46,090 --> 00:00:46,100
open it the flower opens and you can see

9
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:48,880
open it the flower opens and you can see
the way it works there's a flower stem

10
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:48,890
the way it works there's a flower stem

11
00:00:48,890 --> 00:00:51,370
the way it works there's a flower stem
is stuck to the spine and it comes up

12
00:00:51,370 --> 00:00:51,380
is stuck to the spine and it comes up

13
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:53,560
is stuck to the spine and it comes up
through a hollow to you the hollow tube

14
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:53,570
through a hollow to you the hollow tube

15
00:00:53,570 --> 00:00:55,450
through a hollow to you the hollow tube
is then attached to this parallel fold

16
00:00:55,450 --> 00:00:55,460
is then attached to this parallel fold

17
00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:59,410
is then attached to this parallel fold
and as it closes the spine fold goes

18
00:00:59,410 --> 00:00:59,420
and as it closes the spine fold goes

19
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:02,770
and as it closes the spine fold goes
down and the top of the parallel fold

20
00:01:02,770 --> 00:01:02,780
down and the top of the parallel fold

21
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:05,380
down and the top of the parallel fold
comes up and as the whole thing opens

22
00:01:05,380 --> 00:01:05,390
comes up and as the whole thing opens

23
00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:08,800
comes up and as the whole thing opens
the spine fold comes up and the parallel

24
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:08,810
the spine fold comes up and the parallel

25
00:01:08,810 --> 00:01:11,940
the spine fold comes up and the parallel
fold goes down and so it's the mechanism

26
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:11,950
fold goes down and so it's the mechanism

27
00:01:11,950 --> 00:01:14,649
fold goes down and so it's the mechanism
transfers that movement to the top of

28
00:01:14,649 --> 00:01:14,659
transfers that movement to the top of

29
00:01:14,659 --> 00:01:16,630
transfers that movement to the top of
the flower and it's quite a new

30
00:01:16,630 --> 00:01:16,640
the flower and it's quite a new

31
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,580
the flower and it's quite a new
mechanism but there's two or three books

32
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:18,590
mechanism but there's two or three books

33
00:01:18,590 --> 00:01:21,010

the middle and as it opens you see the

44
00:01:36,550 --> 00:01:36,560
the middle and as it opens you see the

45
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:40,179

you can see there's the stalk that comes

48
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:42,350
you can see there's the stalk that comes

49
00:01:42,350 --> 00:01:45,730
you can see there's the stalk that comes
up through the middle and all the the

parallel fold is extremely fancy and

53
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:49,630
parallel fold is extremely fancy and
then you've got more parallel folds on

54
00:01:49,630 --> 00:01:49,640
then you've got more parallel folds on

55
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:51,999
then you've got more parallel folds on

nine that as the page goes flat

101
00:02:59,209 --> 00:03:00,970
nine that as the page goes flat
the pop-up goes fairly flat and it

102
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:00,980
the pop-up goes fairly flat and it

103
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:04,270
the pop-up goes fairly flat and it
creates these gullies off-center and

104
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:04,280
creates these gullies off-center and

105
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:06,369
creates these gullies off-center and
then these two flowers are built into

106
00:03:06,369 --> 00:03:06,379
then these two flowers are built into

107
00:03:06,379 --> 00:03:08,500
then these two flowers are built into
that those gullies these run that

108
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:08,510
that those gullies these run that

working on the central gully if you look

110
00:03:10,509 --> 00:03:10,519
working on the central gully if you look

111
00:03:10,519 --> 00:03:12,849
working on the central gully if you look
at it end on you can see there's a

112
00:03:12,849 --> 00:03:12,859
at it end on you can see there's a

113
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:15,099
at it end on you can see there's a
pillar goes up the middle raises the

114
00:03:15,099 --> 00:03:15,109
pillar goes up the middle raises the

115
00:03:15,109 --> 00:03:16,869
pillar goes up the middle raises the
middle of the flower and then there's

116
00:03:16,869 --> 00:03:16,879
middle of the flower and then there's

117
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:19,960
middle of the flower and then there's
pieces on the outer edges pull down the

118
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:19,970
pieces on the outer edges pull down the

119
00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:24,819
pieces on the outer edges pull down the
outer edges of the flower so now I'll

120
00:03:24,819 --> 00:03:24,829
outer edges of the flower so now I'll

121
00:03:24,829 --> 00:03:32,619
outer edges of the flower so now I'll
just make one so we start with a face

122
00:03:32,619 --> 00:03:32,629
just make one so we start with a face

123
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:33,429
just make one so we start with a face

00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:40,250
and then this is the piece that's going

129
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:42,520
and then this is the piece that's going
to be the stalk up the middles I'm

130
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:42,530
to be the stalk up the middles I'm

131
00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:44,679
to be the stalk up the middles I'm
making it several layers thick I've

132
00:03:44,679 --> 00:03:44,689
making it several layers thick I've

133
00:03:44,689 --> 00:03:48,309
making it several layers thick I've
scored it already beforehand so I can

134
00:03:48,309 --> 00:03:48,319
scored it already beforehand so I can

135
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:50,469
scored it already beforehand so I can
just fold it up put glue in I've also

136
00:03:50,469 --> 00:03:50,479
just fold it up put glue in I've also

137
00:03:50,479 --> 00:03:52,990
just fold it up put glue in I've also
measured it I've cut it so it's got

138
00:03:52,990 --> 00:03:53,000
measured it I've cut it so it's got

139
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,020
measured it I've cut it so it's got
flaps at the bottom flaps at the top so

140
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:56,030
flaps at the bottom flaps at the top so

141
00:03:56,030 --> 00:03:57,249
flaps at the bottom flaps at the top so
these are the ones that we'll stick it

142
00:03:57,249 --> 00:03:57,259
these are the ones that we'll stick it

143
00:03:57,259 --> 00:03:59,499
these are the ones that we'll stick it
to the base these are the ones that will

144
00:03:59,499 --> 00:03:59,509
to the base these are the ones that will

145
00:03:59,509 --> 00:04:01,209
to the base these are the ones that will
stick it to the flower and I've measured

146
00:04:01,209 --> 00:04:01,219
stick it to the flower and I've measured

147
00:04:01,219 --> 00:04:03,459
stick it to the flower and I've measured
it so I've put the crease where it's

148
00:04:03,459 --> 00:04:03,469
it so I've put the crease where it's

149
00:04:03,469 --> 00:04:05,199
it so I've put the crease where it's
going to stick to the spine there and

150
00:04:05,199 --> 00:04:05,209
going to stick to the spine there and

151
00:04:05,209 --> 00:04:06,849
going to stick to the spine there and
you can see the top of the whole thing

152
00:04:06,849 --> 00:04:06,859
you can see the top of the whole thing

153
00:04:06,859 --> 00:04:08,589
you can see the top of the whole thing
is going to come here that's where the

154
00:04:08,589 --> 00:04:08,599
is going to come here that's where the

155
00:04:08,599 --> 00:04:10,779
is going to come here that's where the
flower is going to stick on so we'll

156
00:04:10,779 --> 00:04:10,789
flower is going to stick on so we'll

157
00:04:10,789 --> 00:04:14,499
flower is going to stick on so we'll
start by just gluing it shut and gluing

158
00:04:14,499 --> 00:04:14,509
start by just gluing it shut and gluing

159
00:04:14,509 --> 00:04:21,189
start by just gluing it shut and gluing
it to the spine so just fold this all

160
00:04:21,189 --> 00:04:21,199
it to the spine so just fold this all

161
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:25,089
it to the spine so just fold this all

164
00:04:26,589 --> 00:04:26,599
that's going to go up the middle it's

165
00:04:26,599 --> 00:04:27,570
that's going to go up the middle it's
got two flaps

166
00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:27,580
got two flaps

167
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:31,320
got two flaps
the button we'll just stick those to the

168
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:31,330
the button we'll just stick those to the

169
00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:39,930
the button we'll just stick those to the
spine

170
00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:39,940


171
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:43,440
so that's duct flush with the spine then

172
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:43,450
so that's duct flush with the spine then

173
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:45,630
so that's duct flush with the spine then
this is the parallel fold that's going

174
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:45,640
this is the parallel fold that's going

175
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:48,390
this is the parallel fold that's going
to go over the top this is how it is

176
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:48,400
to go over the top this is how it is

177
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:51,450
to go over the top this is how it is
it's got a tab on each side and it's got

178
00:04:51,450 --> 00:04:51,460
it's got a tab on each side and it's got

179
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:53,010
it's got a tab on each side and it's got
a hole in the middle for the stork to go

180
00:04:53,010 --> 00:04:53,020
a hole in the middle for the stork to go

181
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:56,700
a hole in the middle for the stork to go
through so just check that out that's

182
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:56,710
through so just check that out that's

183
00:04:56,710 --> 00:05:00,480
through so just check that out that's
going to be like that fold these

184
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:00,490
going to be like that fold these

185
00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:09,570
going to be like that fold these
underneath so I'll glue them both at the

186
00:05:09,570 --> 00:05:09,580
underneath so I'll glue them both at the

187
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:12,630
underneath so I'll glue them both at the
same time that will follow that method

188
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:12,640
same time that will follow that method

189
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:14,190
same time that will follow that method
of gluing these stick one side down

190
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:14,200
of gluing these stick one side down

191
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:16,260
of gluing these stick one side down
first and then let the other one find

192
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:16,270
first and then let the other one find

193
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:29,510
first and then let the other one find
its natural position

194
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:29,520


195
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:32,480
there's one I fold it all into the into

196
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:32,490
there's one I fold it all into the into

197
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:33,939
there's one I fold it all into the into
the closed position

198
00:05:33,939 --> 00:05:33,949
the closed position

199
00:05:33,949 --> 00:05:44,240
the closed position
shut the base so it knows where it wants

200
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:44,250
shut the base so it knows where it wants

201
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:49,189

00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:10,640
tube and then at the bottom this is
where it's going to attach to the

212
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:10,650
where it's going to attach to the

213
00:06:10,650 --> 00:06:13,670
where it's going to attach to the
parallel fold so we'll just fold that

214
00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:13,680
parallel fold so we'll just fold that

215
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:21,800
parallel fold so we'll just fold that
layer and take one of those out so it's

216
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:21,810
layer and take one of those out so it's

217
00:06:21,810 --> 00:06:33,050
layer and take one of those out so it's
just got two flaps at the bottom here's

this is coming up and slit it to that

224
00:06:41,899 --> 00:06:41,909
this is coming up and slit it to that

225
00:06:41,909 --> 00:06:47,810
this is coming up and slit it to that
point that comes up to there make sure

down to here I'll just cut another piece

230
00:06:56,930 --> 00:06:56,940
down to here I'll just cut another piece

231
00:06:56,940 --> 00:07:00,070
down to here I'll just cut another piece
off so it's just left with two flaps you

232
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:00,080
off so it's just left with two flaps you

233
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:08,960
off so it's just left with two flaps you
cut that down to here

00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:08,970


235
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:12,120
and split it up to here so there's two

236
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:12,130
and split it up to here so there's two

237
00:07:12,130 --> 00:07:19,590
and split it up to here so there's two
flaps and we can glue it shut not too

238
00:07:19,590 --> 00:07:19,600
flaps and we can glue it shut not too

239
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:29,910
flaps and we can glue it shut not too
much glue

240
00:07:29,910 --> 00:07:29,920


241
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:34,090
and now sit this over the sleeve

242
00:07:34,090 --> 00:07:34,100
and now sit this over the sleeve

243
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:37,690
and now sit this over the sleeve
I just wanna poke this into it to open

244
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:37,700
I just wanna poke this into it to open

245
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:44,170
I just wanna poke this into it to open
it up a bit settle or work easily no

246
00:07:44,170 --> 00:07:44,180
it up a bit settle or work easily no

247
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:46,720
it up a bit settle or work easily no
y'all we glued these two onto the

248
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:46,730
y'all we glued these two onto the

249
00:07:46,730 --> 00:07:56,950
y'all we glued these two onto the
parallel fold

250
00:07:56,950 --> 00:07:56,960


251
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:02,830
oh yeah now these are going to float

252
00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:02,840
oh yeah now these are going to float

253
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:07,570
oh yeah now these are going to float
back this is the flower piece we can

254
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:07,580
back this is the flower piece we can

255
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:10,150
back this is the flower piece we can
glue this onto the flaps we've made at

256
00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:10,160
glue this onto the flaps we've made at

257
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:27,160
glue this onto the flaps we've made at
the top of the stalk

258
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:27,170


259
00:08:27,170 --> 00:08:30,470
when this is flat these will be coming

260
00:08:30,470 --> 00:08:30,480
when this is flat these will be coming

261
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:32,810
when this is flat these will be coming
up to join onto it so you now need to

262
00:08:32,810 --> 00:08:32,820
up to join onto it so you now need to

263
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:36,950
up to join onto it so you now need to
add the creases where it's going to just

264
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:36,960
add the creases where it's going to just

265
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:41,090
add the creases where it's going to just
fit on on to the flower at the top so

266
00:08:41,090 --> 00:08:41,100
fit on on to the flower at the top so

267
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:45,260
fit on on to the flower at the top so
you've got one there and one here let's

268
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:45,270
you've got one there and one here let's

269
00:08:45,270 --> 00:08:48,890
you've got one there and one here let's
check that the height is all right bit

270
00:08:48,890 --> 00:08:48,900
check that the height is all right bit

271
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:51,140
check that the height is all right bit
by and large this but you'll get the

272
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:51,150
by and large this but you'll get the

273
00:08:51,150 --> 00:08:57,530
by and large this but you'll get the
idea and now we glue these onto the

274
00:08:57,530 --> 00:08:57,540
idea and now we glue these onto the

275
00:08:57,540 --> 00:09:05,810
idea and now we glue these onto the
flower in its open position so with that

276
00:09:05,810 --> 00:09:05,820
flower in its open position so with that

277
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:08,870
flower in its open position so with that
flat that's straight up we just glue

278
00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:08,880
flat that's straight up we just glue

279
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:15,980
flat that's straight up we just glue
that on and then we need to wait a

280
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:15,990
that on and then we need to wait a

281
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:18,680
that on and then we need to wait a
minute for the glue to go off because

282
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:18,690
minute for the glue to go off because

283
00:09:18,690 --> 00:09:20,570
minute for the glue to go off because
then then we'll close the whole thing a

284
00:09:20,570 --> 00:09:20,580
then then we'll close the whole thing a

285
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:22,790
then then we'll close the whole thing a
little front these two pieces meet need

286
00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:22,800
little front these two pieces meet need

287
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,350
little front these two pieces meet need
folding them so we'll close the whole

288
00:09:24,350 --> 00:09:24,360
folding them so we'll close the whole

289
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:26,560
folding them so we'll close the whole
thing and it'll find its natural place

290
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:26,570
thing and it'll find its natural place

291
00:09:26,570 --> 00:09:30,680
thing and it'll find its natural place
just before I do that I'll just say you

00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:36,510
design and paper mechanics but there's

297
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:38,120
design and paper mechanics but there's
nothing about this mechanism in it

nothing about this mechanism in it
there's all sorts of other interesting

300
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:39,870
there's all sorts of other interesting

301
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:43,370
there's all sorts of other interesting
stuff so with luck now this glue has

302
00:09:43,370 --> 00:09:43,380
stuff so with luck now this glue has

303
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:48,590
stuff so with luck now this glue has
gone off enough we can close it and make

304
00:09:48,590 --> 00:09:48,600
gone off enough we can close it and make

305
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:52,880
gone off enough we can close it and make
sure that these folds crease in the

306
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:52,890
sure that these folds crease in the

307
00:09:52,890 --> 00:10:26,590
sure that these folds crease in the
right place there you go

308
00:10:26,590 --> 00:10:26,600


309
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:28,660
