parallel fold to move as you open close
传播这是您的例子

4
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:39,260
parallel fold to move as you open close
打开它，花就会打开，你可以看到

5
00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:41,819
parallel fold to move as you open close
the spread here's the example as you
它的工作方式有一个花梗

6
00:00:41,819 --> 00:00:41,829
the spread here's the example as you
粘在脊椎上，它就会出现

7
00:00:41,829 --> 00:00:46,090
the spread here's the example as you
open it the flower opens and you can see
通过空心给你空心管

8
00:00:46,090 --> 00:00:46,100
open it the flower opens and you can see
然后连接到此平行折叠

9
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:48,880
open it the flower opens and you can see
the way it works there's a flower stem
当它关闭时，脊椎褶皱就消失了

10
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:48,890
the way it works there's a flower stem
向下和顶部平行折叠

11
00:00:48,890 --> 00:00:51,370
the way it works there's a flower stem
is stuck to the spine and it comes up
出现并且整个事情都打开了

12
00:00:51,370 --> 00:00:51,380
is stuck to the spine and it comes up
脊椎褶皱出现，平行

13
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:53,560
is stuck to the spine and it comes up
through a hollow to you the hollow tube
折叠下降，这是机制

14
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:53,570
through a hollow to you the hollow tube
将该运动转移到

15
00:00:53,570 --> 00:00:55,450
through a hollow to you the hollow tube
is then attached to this parallel fold
花，这是很新的

16
00:00:55,450 --> 00:00:55,460
is then attached to this parallel fold
机制，但有两三本书

17
00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:59,410
is then attached to this parallel fold
and as it closes the spine fold goes
我会告诉你的

18
00:00:59,410 --> 00:00:59,420
and as it closes the spine fold goes
我想告诉你的第一个是

19
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:02,770
and as it closes the spine fold goes
down and the top of the parallel fold
David Pellom的足迹

20
00:01:02,770 --> 00:01:02,780
down and the top of the parallel fold
这是一本非常美丽的书

21
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:05,380
down and the top of the parallel fold
comes up and as the whole thing opens
用白色做，花在这里

22
00:01:05,380 --> 00:01:05,390
comes up and as the whole thing opens
中间，当它打开时，您会看到

23
00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:08,800
comes up and as the whole thing opens
the spine fold comes up and the parallel
花开了，如果你看着它结束

24
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:08,810
the spine fold comes up and the parallel
你会看到有来的茎

25
00:01:08,810 --> 00:01:11,940
the spine fold comes up and the parallel
fold goes down and so it's the mechanism
贯穿整个中间

26
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:11,950
fold goes down and so it's the mechanism
平行折叠非常花哨，

27
00:01:11,950 --> 00:01:14,649
fold goes down and so it's the mechanism
transfers that movement to the top of
那么你会有更多的平行折叠

28
00:01:14,649 --> 00:01:14,659
transfers that movement to the top of
顶部和柜台折叠整个

29
00:01:14,659 --> 00:01:16,630
transfers that movement to the top of
the flower and it's quite a new
事情真的很壮观

偏心地创建这些沟渠，然后

53
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:49,630
parallel fold is extremely fancy and
then you've got more parallel folds on
然后将这两朵花内置

54
00:01:49,630 --> 00:01:49,640
then you've got more parallel folds on
那些沟渠使这些

55

differently flowers aren't on such high
脊柱

86
00:02:40,089 --> 00:02:40,099
differently flowers aren't on such high
这样管子就和脊柱齐平了

87
00:02:40,099 --> 00:02:43,000
differently flowers aren't on such high
stalks all of them work on the same
这是平行折叠

88
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:43,010
stalks all of them work on the same
越过顶端，这就是事实

89
00:02:43,010 --> 00:02:45,220
stalks all of them work on the same
principle there's a stalk up the middle
每侧都有一个标签，

90
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:45,230
principle there's a stalk up the middle
中间有一个洞，可以让鹳走

91
00:02:45,230 --> 00:02:47,559
principle there's a stalk up the middle
pushing up the middle of the flower and
通过，所以只需检查那是

92
00:02:47,559 --> 00:02:47,569
pushing up the middle of the flower and
将像这些折叠

93
00:02:47,569 --> 00:02:50,500
pushing up the middle of the flower and
then those pieces on the outside pulling
在下面，所以我会把它们都粘在

94
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:50,510
then those pieces on the outside pulling
同时将遵循该方法

95
00:02:50,510 --> 00:02:53,259
then those pieces on the outside pulling
it down all the flowers on this have
将这些粘着的一面朝下

96
00:02:53,259 --> 00:02:53,269
it down all the flowers on this have
首先，然后让另一个人找到

97
00:02:53,269 --> 00:02:55,390
it down all the flowers on this have
built onto the strap which is tutorial
它的自然位置

98
00:02:55,390 --> 00:02:55,400
built onto the strap which is tutorial
有一个我将其全部折叠成

99
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:59,199
built onto the strap which is tutorial
nine that as the page goes flat
平仓

100
00:02:59,199 --> 00:02:59,209
nine that as the page goes flat
关闭底座，以便知道要放哪里

101
00:02:59,209 --> 00:03:00,970
nine that as the page goes flat
the pop-up goes fairly flat and it
我会做的袖子

102
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:00,980
the pop-up goes fairly flat and it
过去了，所以他们需要

103
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:04,270
the pop-up goes fairly flat and it
creates these gullies off-center and
分数线我只是一折线

104
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:04,280
creates these gullies off-center and
并确保将其整齐地折叠成一个

105
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:06,369
creates these gullies off-center and
then these two flowers are built into
管，然后在底部，这是

106
00:03:06,369 --> 00:03:06,379
then these two flowers are built into
它会附在哪里

107
00:03:06,379 --> 00:03:08,500
then these two flowers are built into
that those gullies these run that
平行折叠，所以我们将其折叠

108
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:08,510
that those gullies these run that
层并取出其中之一，所以

109
00:03:08,510 --> 00:03:10,509
that those gullies these run that
working on the central gully if you look
底部只有两个襟翼

110
00:03:10,509 --> 00:03:10,519
working on the central gully if you look
袖子这将要点击

111
00:03:10,519 --> 00:03:12,849
working on the central gully if you look
at it end on you can see there's a
我们需要测量的茎高

112
00:03:12,849 --> 00:03:12,859
at it end on you can see there's a
这快到把它切成那个

113
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:15,099
at it end on you can see there's a
pillar goes up the middle raises the
到达那里的点确保

114
00:03:15,099 --> 00:03:15,109
pillar goes up the middle raises the
它冲在那里并切开

115
00:03:15,109 --> 00:03:16,869
pillar goes up the middle raises the
middle of the flower and then there's
到这里，我要再切一块

116
00:03:16,869 --> 00:03:16,879
middle of the flower and then there's
关闭，所以只剩下两个襟翼

117
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:19,960
middle of the flower and then there's
pieces on the outer edges pull down the
削减到这里

118
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:19,970
pieces on the outer edges pull down the
并拆分到这里，所以有两个

119
00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:24,819
pieces on the outer edges pull down the
outer edges of the flower so now I'll
拍打，我们可以将其粘上

120
00:03:24,819 --> 00:03:24,829
outer edges of the flower so now I'll
多胶水

121
00:03:24,829 --> 00:03:32,619
outer edges of the flower so now I'll
just make one so we start with a face
现在坐在袖子上

122
00:03:32,619 --> 00:03:32,629
just make one so we start with a face
我只是想把它戳开

123
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:33,429
just make one so we start with a face
sheet
它有点安定或容易工作否

124
00:03:33,429 --> 00:03:33,439
sheet
你们都把这两个粘在了

125
00:03:33,439 --> 00:03:36,969
sheet
well folded creased really thoroughly
平行折叠

126
00:03:36,969 --> 00:03:36,979
well folded creased really thoroughly
哦，是的，这些现在要漂浮了

127
00:03:36,979 --> 00:03:40,240
well folded creased really thoroughly
and then this is the piece that's going
回到这是我们可以的花片

128
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:40,250
and then this is the piece that's going
粘在我们制作的皮瓣上

129
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:42,520
and then this is the piece that's going
to be the stalk up the middles I'm
茎的顶部

130
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:42,530
to be the stalk up the middles I'm
当这平坦的时候，这些将会来

131
00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:44,679
to be the stalk up the middles I'm
making it several layers thick I've
加入它，所以您现在需要

132
00:03:44,679 --> 00:03:44,689
making it several layers thick I've
将折痕添加到

133
00:03:44,689 --> 00:03:48,309
making it several layers thick I've
scored it already beforehand so I can
适合顶部的花朵，所以

134
00:03:48,309 --> 00:03:48,319
scored it already beforehand so I can
你那里一个，这里一个

135
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:50,469
scored it already beforehand so I can
just fold it up put glue in I've also
检查高度是否正确

136
00:03:50,469 --> 00:03:50,479
just fold it up put glue in I've also
总的来说，但是你会得到

137
00:03:50,479 --> 00:03:52,990
just fold it up put glue in I've also
measured it I've cut it so it's got
想法，现在我们将这些粘贴到

138
00:03:52,990 --> 00:03:53,000
measured it I've cut it so it's got
花在它的打开位置

139
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,020
measured it I've cut it so it's got
flaps at the bottom flaps at the top so
平直的，我们只是胶水

140
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:56,030
flaps at the bottom flaps at the top so
那然后我们需要等待一个
