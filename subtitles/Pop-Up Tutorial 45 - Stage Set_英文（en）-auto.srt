have two other pieces this is slightly

50
00:01:41,630 --> 00:01:41,640
have two other pieces this is slightly

51
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:43,730
have two other pieces this is slightly
longer than the first one this is

52
00:01:43,730 --> 00:01:43,740
longer than the first one this is

53
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:45,649
longer than the first one this is
slightly longer than the second one and

54
00:01:45,649 --> 00:01:45,659
slightly longer than the second one and

55
00:01:45,659 --> 00:01:47,810
slightly longer than the second one and
they're all slightly shorter than the

56
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:47,820
they're all slightly shorter than the

57
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:50,030
they're all slightly shorter than the
final one so now I'll make one so you

58
00:01:50,030 --> 00:01:50,040
final one so now I'll make one so you

59
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:51,610

in like this and so you can see there's

68
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:03,570
in like this and so you can see there's

69
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:04,940
in like this and so you can see there's
going to be one piece that's longer

70
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:04,950
going to be one piece that's longer

71
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:06,980
going to be one piece that's longer
that's going to go in there and another

72
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:06,990
that's going to go in there and another

73
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:08,330
that's going to go in there and another
piece that's shorter that's going to go

them adding up to 360 as it is I'm just

90
00:02:30,899 --> 00:02:30,909
them adding up to 360 as it is I'm just

91
00:02:30,909 --> 00:02:32,190
them adding up to 360 as it is I'm just
making the one so it doesn't really

92
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:32,200
making the one so it doesn't really

93
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:36,089
making the one so it doesn't really
matter it's just what suits me so I'm

94
00:02:36,089 --> 00:02:36,099
matter it's just what suits me so I'm

95
00:02:36,099 --> 00:02:38,789

going to put this in position to see

96
00:02:38,789 --> 00:02:38,799
going to put this in position to see

97
00:02:38,799 --> 00:02:41,880
going to put this in position to see
roughly where I need to make the folds

98
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:41,890
roughly where I need to make the folds

99
00:02:41,890 --> 00:02:44,430
roughly where I need to make the folds
to make these tabs that will stick it on

100
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:44,440
to make these tabs that will stick it on

101
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:47,520
to make these tabs that will stick it on
I'm going to make a mark so I can just

102
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:47,530
I'm going to make a mark so I can just

103
00:02:47,530 --> 00:02:49,949
I'm going to make a mark so I can just
see roughly where to put those

104
00:02:49,949 --> 00:02:49,959
see roughly where to put those

105
00:02:49,959 --> 00:02:55,589

bowls it's going to be about here fold

106
00:02:55,589 --> 00:02:55,599
bowls it's going to be about here fold

107
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:57,259

that in half

108
00:02:57,259 --> 00:02:57,269
that in half

109
00:02:57,269 --> 00:03:01,020
that in half
hold it there so this is how wide the

110
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:01,030
hold it there so this is how wide the

111
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:05,039
hold it there so this is how wide the
whole thing is gonna open up - so

112
00:03:05,039 --> 00:03:05,049
whole thing is gonna open up - so

113
00:03:05,049 --> 00:03:09,000
whole thing is gonna open up - so
there's gonna be two tabs on each side

114
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:09,010
there's gonna be two tabs on each side

115
00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:18,150
there's gonna be two tabs on each side
of that and before I put that in I've

116
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:18,160
of that and before I put that in I've

117
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:20,189
of that and before I put that in I've
got to make another one that's coming in

118
00:03:20,189 --> 00:03:20,199
got to make another one that's coming in

119
00:03:20,199 --> 00:03:21,979
got to make another one that's coming in
between the blue one and the yellow one

120
00:03:21,979 --> 00:03:21,989
between the blue one and the yellow one

121
00:03:21,989 --> 00:03:25,199
between the blue one and the yellow one
I'll use this as a guide and make it

122
00:03:25,199 --> 00:03:25,209
I'll use this as a guide and make it

123
00:03:25,209 --> 00:03:28,110
I'll use this as a guide and make it
longer than the blue but it'll still be

124
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:28,120
longer than the blue but it'll still be

125
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:30,800
longer than the blue but it'll still be
shorter than the yellow so let's make it

126
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:30,810
shorter than the yellow so let's make it

127
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:52,570
shorter than the yellow so let's make it
about here so I'll fold that

128
00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:52,580


129
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:56,210
and we'll just check how well this is

130
00:03:56,210 --> 00:03:56,220
and we'll just check how well this is

131
00:03:56,220 --> 00:04:02,000
and we'll just check how well this is
going to all fit together okay

132
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:02,010
going to all fit together okay

133
00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:06,740
going to all fit together okay
yellow is number four blue is number two

134
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:06,750
yellow is number four blue is number two

135
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:19,100
yellow is number four blue is number two
and gray as number one so it's going to

136
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:19,110
and gray as number one so it's going to

137
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:23,060
and gray as number one so it's going to
be like this you look at it Endon it's

138
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:23,070
be like this you look at it Endon it's

139
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:25,190
be like this you look at it Endon it's
going to be like that and before you

140
00:04:25,190 --> 00:04:25,200
going to be like that and before you

141
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:27,470
going to be like that and before you
glue them you need to cut the holes you

142
00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:27,480
glue them you need to cut the holes you

143
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:29,180
glue them you need to cut the holes you
need to make your design on all of them

144
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:29,190
need to make your design on all of them

145
00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:32,360
need to make your design on all of them
and cut the holes into them so this gray

146
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:32,370
and cut the holes into them so this gray

147
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:34,790
and cut the holes into them so this gray
this is number one this is just going to

148
00:04:34,790 --> 00:04:34,800
this is number one this is just going to

149
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,470
this is number one this is just going to
be the screen that you're looking

150
00:04:36,470 --> 00:04:36,480
be the screen that you're looking

151
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:38,090
be the screen that you're looking
through so I'm just going to make that

152
00:04:38,090 --> 00:04:38,100
through so I'm just going to make that

153
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:42,410
through so I'm just going to make that
really simple and just cut a rectangle

154
00:04:42,410 --> 00:04:42,420
really simple and just cut a rectangle

155
00:04:42,420 --> 00:05:02,850
really simple and just cut a rectangle
out of it

156
00:05:02,850 --> 00:05:02,860


157
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:05,530
so that's going to be the front this is

158
00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:05,540
so that's going to be the front this is

159
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:06,820
so that's going to be the front this is
going to be the back we don't cut

160
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:06,830
going to be the back we don't cut

161
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:10,690
going to be the back we don't cut
anything off that this is going to be

162
00:05:10,690 --> 00:05:10,700
anything off that this is going to be

163
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:12,430
anything off that this is going to be
number two that you're looking through

164
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:12,440
number two that you're looking through

165
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:14,620
number two that you're looking through
and then this will be the final one so

166
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:14,630
and then this will be the final one so

167
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:17,170
and then this will be the final one so
on this you really need to work out your

168
00:05:17,170 --> 00:05:17,180
on this you really need to work out your

169
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:20,500
on this you really need to work out your
design whatever you want you draw it on

170
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:20,510
design whatever you want you draw it on

171
00:05:20,510 --> 00:05:22,830
design whatever you want you draw it on
and cut it out I'll just do something

172
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:22,840
and cut it out I'll just do something

173
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:30,160
and cut it out I'll just do something
quite basic I think but quite big

174
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:30,170
quite basic I think but quite big

175
00:05:30,170 --> 00:05:31,750
quite basic I think but quite big
because you want to be able to see

176
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:31,760
because you want to be able to see

177
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:43,660
because you want to be able to see
through it to the third level and then

178
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:43,670
through it to the third level and then

179
00:05:43,670 --> 00:05:45,340
through it to the third level and then
this is the final one this will be

180
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:45,350
this is the final one this will be

181
00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:47,530
this is the final one this will be
number three that's the final thing you

182
00:05:47,530 --> 00:05:47,540
number three that's the final thing you

183
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:49,540
number three that's the final thing you
look through so that could be a smaller

184
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:49,550
look through so that could be a smaller

185
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:53,140
look through so that could be a smaller
hole so you have bits of it showing bits

186
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:53,150
hole so you have bits of it showing bits

187
00:05:53,150 --> 00:06:08,700
hole so you have bits of it showing bits
of it hidden by the blue section right

188
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:08,710
of it hidden by the blue section right

189
00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:12,100
of it hidden by the blue section right
so we take the base folder crease is

190
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:12,110
so we take the base folder crease is

191
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:21,010
so we take the base folder crease is
really well and just glue them on glue

192
00:06:21,010 --> 00:06:21,020
really well and just glue them on glue

193
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:31,100
really well and just glue them on glue
on them both at the same time

194
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:31,110


195
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:46,380
okay this is going in here if you want

196
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:46,390
okay this is going in here if you want

197
00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:48,720
okay this is going in here if you want
at this point this not too late you can

198
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:48,730
at this point this not too late you can

199
00:06:48,730 --> 00:06:50,660
at this point this not too late you can
actually stick other pieces on a

200
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:50,670
actually stick other pieces on a

201
00:06:50,670 --> 00:06:55,050
actually stick other pieces on a
different color you just want to add to

202
00:06:55,050 --> 00:06:55,060
different color you just want to add to

203
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:57,630
different color you just want to add to
it this is your chance to do it easily

204
00:06:57,630 --> 00:06:57,640
it this is your chance to do it easily

205
00:06:57,640 --> 00:07:07,640
it this is your chance to do it easily
and stick pieces on like this now we put

206
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:07,650
and stick pieces on like this now we put

207
00:07:07,650 --> 00:07:31,260
and stick pieces on like this now we put
level two on just shut it down and press

208
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:31,270
level two on just shut it down and press

209
00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:33,060
level two on just shut it down and press
it firmly make sure it's all working

210
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:33,070
it firmly make sure it's all working

211
00:07:33,070 --> 00:07:37,020
it firmly make sure it's all working
nicely and now we put the third level in

212
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:37,030
nicely and now we put the third level in

213
00:07:37,030 --> 00:07:39,630
nicely and now we put the third level in
looking at this I don't actually like

214
00:07:39,630 --> 00:07:39,640
looking at this I don't actually like

215
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:41,340
looking at this I don't actually like
that blue piece are stuck in I'm just

216
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:41,350
that blue piece are stuck in I'm just

217
00:07:41,350 --> 00:07:43,080
that blue piece are stuck in I'm just
going to take that off I think maybe if

218
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:43,090
going to take that off I think maybe if

219
00:07:43,090 --> 00:07:44,490
going to take that off I think maybe if
it had been red or something completely

220
00:07:44,490 --> 00:07:44,500
it had been red or something completely

221
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:46,590
it had been red or something completely
different it would have worked but it

222
00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:46,600
different it would have worked but it

223
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,360
different it would have worked but it
was just muddling up the whole design

224
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:48,370
was just muddling up the whole design

225
00:07:48,370 --> 00:07:51,570
was just muddling up the whole design
and then this is the final piece this is

226
00:07:51,570 --> 00:07:51,580
and then this is the final piece this is

227
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:54,540
and then this is the final piece this is
the one that dictates how wide the scene

228
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:54,550
the one that dictates how wide the scene

229
00:07:54,550 --> 00:08:21,600
the one that dictates how wide the scene
will open there we are so this is just a

230
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:21,610
will open there we are so this is just a

231
00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:23,400
will open there we are so this is just a
really crude design showing you how it

232
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:23,410
really crude design showing you how it

233
00:08:23,410 --> 00:08:25,440
really crude design showing you how it
works and how to put it all together but

234
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:25,450
works and how to put it all together but

235
00:08:25,450 --> 00:08:27,180
works and how to put it all together but
the whole point of this mechanism is

236
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:27,190
the whole point of this mechanism is

237
00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:30,120
the whole point of this mechanism is
that you can generate a really wonderful

238
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:30,130
that you can generate a really wonderful

239
00:08:30,130 --> 00:08:34,290
that you can generate a really wonderful
sense of depth and perspective by

240
00:08:34,290 --> 00:08:34,300
sense of depth and perspective by

241
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:35,580
sense of depth and perspective by
playing around with it and really

242
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:35,590
playing around with it and really

243
00:08:35,590 --> 00:08:37,860
playing around with it and really
working on the design and thinking about

244
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:37,870
working on the design and thinking about

245
00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:41,219
working on the design and thinking about
it asymmetrical here we have Alibaba you

246
00:08:41,219 --> 00:08:41,229
it asymmetrical here we have Alibaba you

247
00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:43,440
it asymmetrical here we have Alibaba you
can see the way he's played around using

248
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:43,450
can see the way he's played around using

249
00:08:43,450 --> 00:08:46,800
can see the way he's played around using
the mechanism to generate perspective

250
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:46,810
the mechanism to generate perspective

251
00:08:46,810 --> 00:08:49,440
the mechanism to generate perspective
and some really nice interesting designs

252
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:49,450
and some really nice interesting designs

253
00:08:49,450 --> 00:08:53,360
and some really nice interesting designs
I think these are really clever

254
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:53,370
I think these are really clever

255
00:08:53,370 --> 00:08:56,660
I think these are really clever
