tutorial 15 is moving arms and tutorial
不对称v形折叠，所以我现在运行

40
00:01:28,330 --> 00:01:28,340
tutorial 15 is moving arms and tutorial
通过一些角度等距

41
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:31,060
tutorial 15 is moving arms and tutorial
24 is circular movement so those are all
甚至看几个例子

42
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:31,070
24 is circular movement so those are all
这个小角度是30度

43
00:01:31,070 --> 00:01:34,780
24 is circular movement so those are all
used to make that that mechanism and the
这是90度，在页面上

44
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:34,790
used to make that that mechanism and the
脊柱和它之间的角度

45
00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:36,580
used to make that that mechanism and the
other one I'd like to show you is this
坚持下来是30和角度

46
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:36,590
other one I'd like to show you is this
在脊椎之间还是粘在这里

47
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:38,050
other one I'd like to show you is this
one very different
整件事都是90时

48
00:01:38,050 --> 00:01:38,060
one very different
整个单身生活和你一样

49
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:40,600
one very different
this is pop-up book and Nursery Rhymes
可以看到整个这样关闭

50
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:40,610
this is pop-up book and Nursery Rhymes
事情向前发展，所以你可以建立

51
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:44,230
this is pop-up book and Nursery Rhymes
again it's by Mathew Reinhardt this is
平行四边形到此襟翼上

52
00:01:44,230 --> 00:01:44,240
again it's by Mathew Reinhardt this is
这个版本的角度和基数是

53
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:47,020
again it's by Mathew Reinhardt this is
the spread so in this case this is the
还是30但小角度和

54
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:47,030
the spread so in this case this is the
不对称v折为35，且角度为

55
00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:49,660
the spread so in this case this is the
structure that's been raised on the one
底数是90，

56
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:49,670
structure that's been raised on the one
不对称v折是95，所以我做了一个

57
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:52,410
structure that's been raised on the one
side of this crease here and the
这些是您所拥有的

58
00:01:52,410 --> 00:01:52,420
side of this crease here and the
在不对称上有大角度

59
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:54,760
side of this crease here and the
asymmetric V pod is actually hidden
件是95，它的小角度是

60
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:54,770
asymmetric V pod is actually hidden
在40度的基础上，您有90度

61
00:01:54,770 --> 00:01:58,660
asymmetric V pod is actually hidden
underneath this floating plane so here
35所以我会坚持那个乐队

62
00:01:58,660 --> 00:01:58,670
underneath this floating plane so here
可以看到所有这些情况

63
00:01:58,670 --> 00:02:00,370
underneath this floating plane so here
you can see this is the floating plane
不对称，所以你有一个小角度

64
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:00,380
you can see this is the floating plane
在弹出窗口超过了大角度

65
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:04,780
you can see this is the floating plane
this is the asymmetric V fold which has
页面上弹出的大角度

66
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:04,790
this is the asymmetric V fold which has
越过页面上的小角度，所以

67
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:07,929
this is the asymmetric V fold which has
been used to raise this structure if you
那样会粘住

68
00:02:07,929 --> 00:02:07,939
been used to raise this structure if you
我将其粘在上面

69
00:02:07,939 --> 00:02:10,240
been used to raise this structure if you
look at this structure end on you can
我已经测量了底座上的位置

70
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:10,250
look at this structure end on you can
然后在弹出窗口中，我就可以完成所有操作

71
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:12,699
look at this structure end on you can
see it's all parallelograms all being
而不是坚持一侧，

72
00:02:12,699 --> 00:02:12,709
see it's all parallelograms all being
让它找到自然的位置

73
00:02:12,709 --> 00:02:13,370
see it's all parallelograms all being
raised by
坚持下去

74
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:13,380
raised by
在那里，它关闭了我

75
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:15,020
raised by

将此襟翼留在顶部只是为了

76
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:15,030
one plane which is lifted by the
可以在上面建立平行四边形

77
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:17,750
one plane which is lifted by the
asymmetric v-fold so now I'll just run
这真的是有用的提示

78
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:17,760
asymmetric v-fold so now I'll just run
在基地的一侧建造东西

79
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,520
asymmetric v-fold so now I'll just run
through some angles for the isometric
