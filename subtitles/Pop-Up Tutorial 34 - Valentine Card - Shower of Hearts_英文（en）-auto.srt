into the gullies but all made in one so

14
00:00:54,869 --> 00:00:54,879
into the gullies but all made in one so

15
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:58,500
into the gullies but all made in one so
this is tutorial 19 and then in actual

16
00:00:58,500 --> 00:00:58,510
this is tutorial 19 and then in actual

17
00:00:58,510 --> 00:01:01,139
this is tutorial 19 and then in actual
fact that as counter folds added to it

18
00:01:01,139 --> 00:01:01,149
fact that as counter folds added to it

19
00:01:01,149 --> 00:01:03,360
fact that as counter folds added to it
added into all the creases

20
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:03,370
added into all the creases

21
00:01:03,370 --> 00:01:06,510
added into all the creases
that's tutorial 22 so here's an M fold

22
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:06,520
that's tutorial 22 so here's an M fold

23
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:10,289
that's tutorial 22 so here's an M fold
with added cats and creases giving you

24
00:01:10,289 --> 00:01:10,299
with added cats and creases giving you

25
00:01:10,299 --> 00:01:11,760
with added cats and creases giving you
these counter folds that give you more

26
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:11,770
these counter folds that give you more

27
00:01:11,770 --> 00:01:16,499
these counter folds that give you more
planes that can all be extended like

28
00:01:16,499 --> 00:01:16,509
planes that can all be extended like

29
00:01:16,509 --> 00:01:19,020
planes that can all be extended like
this you'll see that all the little

30
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:19,030
this you'll see that all the little

31
00:01:19,030 --> 00:01:20,520
this you'll see that all the little
different planes have got these arms

32
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:20,530
different planes have got these arms

33
00:01:20,530 --> 00:01:22,469
different planes have got these arms
stuck onto them with hearts and stuff on

34
00:01:22,469 --> 00:01:22,479
stuck onto them with hearts and stuff on

35
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:24,510
stuck onto them with hearts and stuff on
the end so I'll just show you how to

36
00:01:24,510 --> 00:01:24,520
the end so I'll just show you how to

37
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:28,560
the end so I'll just show you how to
make one of those really quickly here's

38
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:28,570
make one of those really quickly here's

39
00:01:28,570 --> 00:01:31,440
make one of those really quickly here's
a base sheet folded in half

40
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:31,450
a base sheet folded in half

41
00:01:31,450 --> 00:01:36,389
a base sheet folded in half
creased really thoroughly this will be

42
00:01:36,389 --> 00:01:36,399
creased really thoroughly this will be

43
00:01:36,399 --> 00:01:39,120
creased really thoroughly this will be
the M fold so again we just fold it in

44
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:39,130
the M fold so again we just fold it in

45
00:01:39,130 --> 00:01:40,010
the M fold so again we just fold it in
half

46
00:01:40,010 --> 00:01:40,020
half

47
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:45,109
half
we cut a wedge out of the up to about

48
00:01:45,109 --> 00:01:45,119
we cut a wedge out of the up to about

49
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:48,260
we cut a wedge out of the up to about
third of the way up something like that

50
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:48,270
third of the way up something like that

51
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:53,630
third of the way up something like that
fold the two sides back like this

52
00:01:53,630 --> 00:01:53,640
fold the two sides back like this

53
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:57,779
fold the two sides back like this
so we've got the two angles and you open

54
00:01:57,779 --> 00:01:57,789
so we've got the two angles and you open

55
00:01:57,789 --> 00:02:00,450
so we've got the two angles and you open
it up the angles on each side below that

56
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:00,460
it up the angles on each side below that

57
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:02,639
it up the angles on each side below that
point they're both the same and then you

58
00:02:02,639 --> 00:02:02,649
point they're both the same and then you

59
00:02:02,649 --> 00:02:06,660
point they're both the same and then you
just take one side fold it up now this

60
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:06,670
just take one side fold it up now this

61
00:02:06,670 --> 00:02:08,969
just take one side fold it up now this
crease must be leaning out away from the

62
00:02:08,969 --> 00:02:08,979
crease must be leaning out away from the

63
00:02:08,979 --> 00:02:11,610
crease must be leaning out away from the
spine it mustn't come to the same point

64
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:11,620
spine it mustn't come to the same point

65
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:12,430
spine it mustn't come to the same point
where all the other

66
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:12,440
where all the other

67
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:14,640
where all the other
is me so you just have it folding up

68
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:14,650
is me so you just have it folding up

69
00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:19,780
is me so you just have it folding up
something like this fold that back on

70
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:19,790
something like this fold that back on

71
00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:24,700
something like this fold that back on
itself and then on the other side it

72
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:24,710
itself and then on the other side it

73
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:26,560
itself and then on the other side it
doesn't have to be the same we can just

74
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:26,570
doesn't have to be the same we can just

75
00:02:26,570 --> 00:02:30,100
doesn't have to be the same we can just
fold it up and again we creat it leaning

76
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:30,110
fold it up and again we creat it leaning

77
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:34,930
fold it up and again we creat it leaning
out away from the middle fold so fold

78
00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:34,940
out away from the middle fold so fold

79
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:38,800
out away from the middle fold so fold
that back on itself and now we can

80
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:38,810
that back on itself and now we can

81
00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:41,910
that back on itself and now we can
concertina this so these folds come

82
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:41,920
concertina this so these folds come

83
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:46,690
concertina this so these folds come
forward tricky there we are and then

84
00:02:46,690 --> 00:02:46,700
forward tricky there we are and then

85
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:50,710
forward tricky there we are and then
fold that back when it comes like this

86
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:50,720
fold that back when it comes like this

87
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:55,330
fold that back when it comes like this
crease it all this will be your M fold

88
00:02:55,330 --> 00:02:55,340
crease it all this will be your M fold

89
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:57,520
crease it all this will be your M fold
I'll just trim it down a bit it's a bit

90
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:57,530
I'll just trim it down a bit it's a bit

91
00:02:57,530 --> 00:02:58,600
I'll just trim it down a bit it's a bit
too big

92
00:02:58,600 --> 00:02:58,610
too big

93
00:02:58,610 --> 00:03:04,390
too big
that's it back something like this and

94
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:04,400
that's it back something like this and

95
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,760
that's it back something like this and
now we have the counter folds into all

96
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:06,770
now we have the counter folds into all

97
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:10,060
now we have the counter folds into all
these creases I might even make that

98
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:10,070
these creases I might even make that

99
00:03:10,070 --> 00:03:11,890
these creases I might even make that
slightly lower because we're going to

100
00:03:11,890 --> 00:03:11,900
slightly lower because we're going to

101
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:14,110
slightly lower because we're going to
have to do the arms that hold the hearts

102
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:14,120
have to do the arms that hold the hearts

103
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:16,210
have to do the arms that hold the hearts
will be jutting out quite a lot sort of

104
00:03:16,210 --> 00:03:16,220
will be jutting out quite a lot sort of

105
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:19,510
will be jutting out quite a lot sort of
stake like that on any of these creases

106
00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:19,520
stake like that on any of these creases

107
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:22,990
stake like that on any of these creases
you can have extra cuts fold them back

108
00:03:22,990 --> 00:03:23,000
you can have extra cuts fold them back

109
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,910
you can have extra cuts fold them back
on themselves and back again push that

110
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:27,920
on themselves and back again push that

111
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:31,390
on themselves and back again push that
through so we've generated two more

112
00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:31,400
through so we've generated two more

113
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:33,460
through so we've generated two more
planes there that can have things added

114
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:33,470
planes there that can have things added

115
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:35,650
planes there that can have things added
to them this one maybe we won't cut it

116
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:35,660
to them this one maybe we won't cut it

117
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:39,070
to them this one maybe we won't cut it
we'll just fold it if you look at

118
00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:39,080
we'll just fold it if you look at

119
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:43,300
we'll just fold it if you look at
tutorial 22 you'll just see all the

120
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:43,310
tutorial 22 you'll just see all the

121
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:45,009
tutorial 22 you'll just see all the
different ways that you can add counter

122
00:03:45,009 --> 00:03:45,019
different ways that you can add counter

123
00:03:45,019 --> 00:03:55,440
different ways that you can add counter
folds to the creases on the pop-up

124
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:55,450


125
00:03:55,450 --> 00:04:00,870
there we go

126
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:00,880


127
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:03,280
so you have things some on this other

128
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:03,290
so you have things some on this other

129
00:04:03,290 --> 00:04:15,449
so you have things some on this other
side as well

130
00:04:15,449 --> 00:04:15,459


131
00:04:15,459 --> 00:04:20,140
so generated quite a few more planes

132
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:20,150
so generated quite a few more planes

133
00:04:20,150 --> 00:04:22,270
so generated quite a few more planes
that can be extended so now I'll just

134
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:22,280
that can be extended so now I'll just

135
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:25,120
that can be extended so now I'll just
stick this down to the page this is a

136
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:25,130
stick this down to the page this is a

137
00:04:25,130 --> 00:04:28,060
stick this down to the page this is a
basic acute angle v-fold that's the

138
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:28,070
basic acute angle v-fold that's the

139
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:30,640
basic acute angle v-fold that's the
heart of it all and as the page closes

140
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:30,650
heart of it all and as the page closes

141
00:04:30,650 --> 00:04:32,620
heart of it all and as the page closes
that's going to fold forward so you want

142
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:32,630
that's going to fold forward so you want

143
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:34,360
that's going to fold forward so you want
this to be up near the top of your page

144
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:34,370
this to be up near the top of your page

145
00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:37,630
this to be up near the top of your page
and as with all these things to make

146
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:37,640
and as with all these things to make

147
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:40,840
and as with all these things to make
sure that the angles match we just put

148
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:40,850
sure that the angles match we just put

149
00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:53,740
sure that the angles match we just put
the glue on one side first stick it down

150
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:53,750
the glue on one side first stick it down

151
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:56,860
the glue on one side first stick it down
with this central crease flush with the

152
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:56,870
with this central crease flush with the

153
00:04:56,870 --> 00:05:00,160
with this central crease flush with the
central crease on the base card you can

154
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:00,170
central crease on the base card you can

155
00:05:00,170 --> 00:05:02,110
central crease on the base card you can
see what angle you think would see you

156
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:02,120
see what angle you think would see you

157
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:03,760
see what angle you think would see you
sit best this looks pretty good to me

158
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:03,770
sit best this looks pretty good to me

159
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:07,960
sit best this looks pretty good to me
then you fold it down shut put glue on

160
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:07,970
then you fold it down shut put glue on

161
00:05:07,970 --> 00:05:15,460
then you fold it down shut put glue on
the other tab smear it always right up

162
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:15,470
the other tab smear it always right up

163
00:05:15,470 --> 00:05:18,400
the other tab smear it always right up
to the creases glue up to the crease is

164
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:18,410
to the creases glue up to the crease is

165
00:05:18,410 --> 00:05:21,880
to the creases glue up to the crease is
the important aspect of this the actual

166
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:21,890
the important aspect of this the actual

167
00:05:21,890 --> 00:05:24,270
the important aspect of this the actual
outer edges don't really matter so much

168
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:24,280
outer edges don't really matter so much

169
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:29,560
outer edges don't really matter so much
and then we shut the base which finds

170
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:29,570
and then we shut the base which finds

171
00:05:29,570 --> 00:05:34,780
and then we shut the base which finds
its natural sticking position that's

172
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:34,790
its natural sticking position that's

173
00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:36,640
its natural sticking position that's
your starting point now you can take

174
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:36,650
your starting point now you can take

175
00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:40,300
your starting point now you can take
just these little pieces little arms and

176
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:40,310
just these little pieces little arms and

177
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:42,940
just these little pieces little arms and
you can stick them out just hang out at

178
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:42,950
you can stick them out just hang out at

179
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:46,960
you can stick them out just hang out at
any angle really so you just put them

180
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:46,970
any angle really so you just put them

181
00:05:46,970 --> 00:05:55,870
any angle really so you just put them
say like this

182
00:05:55,870 --> 00:05:55,880


183
00:05:55,880 --> 00:06:04,130
like that and you need to check it every

184
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:04,140
like that and you need to check it every

185
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:06,140
like that and you need to check it every
so often and as you add them just to

186
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:06,150
so often and as you add them just to

187
00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:08,170
so often and as you add them just to
make sure they're not going to be

188
00:06:08,170 --> 00:06:08,180
make sure they're not going to be

189
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:11,990
make sure they're not going to be
clashing as the place closes so we shut

190
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:12,000
clashing as the place closes so we shut

191
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:33,120
clashing as the place closes so we shut
this and you yeah so far so good

192
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:33,130


193
00:06:33,130 --> 00:06:39,400
there we go coming out like this you can

194
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:39,410
there we go coming out like this you can

195
00:06:39,410 --> 00:06:42,279
there we go coming out like this you can
add arms on to arms I've actually cut

196
00:06:42,279 --> 00:06:42,289
add arms on to arms I've actually cut

197
00:06:42,289 --> 00:06:43,900
add arms on to arms I've actually cut
all these straight they could be curved

198
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:43,910
all these straight they could be curved

199
00:06:43,910 --> 00:06:47,279
all these straight they could be curved
but you could come out say like this so

200
00:06:47,279 --> 00:06:47,289
but you could come out say like this so

201
00:06:47,289 --> 00:06:49,810
but you could come out say like this so
you're starting to create quite a

202
00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:49,820
you're starting to create quite a

203
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:53,770
you're starting to create quite a
complicated interesting sort of almost

204
00:06:53,770 --> 00:06:53,780
complicated interesting sort of almost

205
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:56,020
complicated interesting sort of almost
of web but it's just an array of arms

206
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:56,030
of web but it's just an array of arms

207
00:06:56,030 --> 00:06:57,700
of web but it's just an array of arms
sticking out that you can then add the

208
00:06:57,700 --> 00:06:57,710
sticking out that you can then add the

209
00:06:57,710 --> 00:07:10,810
sticking out that you can then add the
hearts to I'll just check again make

210
00:07:10,810 --> 00:07:10,820
hearts to I'll just check again make

211
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:18,279
hearts to I'll just check again make
sure that it's all okay and on and on I

212
00:07:18,279 --> 00:07:18,289
sure that it's all okay and on and on I

213
00:07:18,289 --> 00:07:20,080
sure that it's all okay and on and on I
think you get the idea without me

214
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:20,090
think you get the idea without me

215
00:07:20,090 --> 00:07:24,129
think you get the idea without me
necessarily needing to to build more of

216
00:07:24,129 --> 00:07:24,139
necessarily needing to to build more of

217
00:07:24,139 --> 00:07:27,370
necessarily needing to to build more of
these I got some quite big hearts here

218
00:07:27,370 --> 00:07:27,380
these I got some quite big hearts here

219
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:30,610
these I got some quite big hearts here
but not really enough I just put the odd

220
00:07:30,610 --> 00:07:30,620
but not really enough I just put the odd

221
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:33,870
but not really enough I just put the odd
one on so you can get the basic

222
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:33,880
one on so you can get the basic

223
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:44,800
one on so you can get the basic
impression so put the glue on the arms

224
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:44,810
impression so put the glue on the arms

225
00:07:44,810 --> 00:07:46,900
impression so put the glue on the arms
rather than on the hearts when you're

226
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:46,910
rather than on the hearts when you're

227
00:07:46,910 --> 00:07:48,250
rather than on the hearts when you're
gluing you always put the glue on the

228
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:48,260
gluing you always put the glue on the

229
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:52,830
gluing you always put the glue on the
smallest surface rather than the larger

230
00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:52,840


231
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:55,210
working so I think that's probably

232
00:07:55,210 --> 00:07:55,220
working so I think that's probably

233
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:57,070
working so I think that's probably
enough so you get the idea of how it

234
00:07:57,070 --> 00:07:57,080
enough so you get the idea of how it

235
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:57,760
enough so you get the idea of how it
works

236
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:57,770
works

237
00:07:57,770 --> 00:07:59,860
works
and you can just build it up and up and

238
00:07:59,860 --> 00:07:59,870
and you can just build it up and up and

239
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:02,200
and you can just build it up and up and
up as complicated as you like just keep

240
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:02,210
up as complicated as you like just keep

241
00:08:02,210 --> 00:08:04,600
up as complicated as you like just keep
checking and it's gonna work like this

242
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:04,610
checking and it's gonna work like this

243
00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:07,029
checking and it's gonna work like this
and that they aren't gonna clash with

244
00:08:07,029 --> 00:08:07,039
and that they aren't gonna clash with

245
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:08,500
and that they aren't gonna clash with
each other that the arms aren't going to

246
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:08,510
each other that the arms aren't going to

247
00:08:08,510 --> 00:08:11,980
each other that the arms aren't going to
tangle up and and snag you can actually

248
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:11,990
tangle up and and snag you can actually

249
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:14,260
tangle up and and snag you can actually
use this technique on all sorts of other

250
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:14,270
use this technique on all sorts of other

251
00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:20,490
use this technique on all sorts of other
basic mechanisms so there's one here

252
00:08:20,490 --> 00:08:20,500
basic mechanisms so there's one here

253
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,870
basic mechanisms so there's one here
this one is based on a twisting

254
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:22,880
this one is based on a twisting

255
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:26,050
this one is based on a twisting
mechanism which is tutorial 17 this bit

256
00:08:26,050 --> 00:08:26,060
mechanism which is tutorial 17 this bit

257
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:28,360
mechanism which is tutorial 17 this bit
hasn't quite work the cards too bendy it

258
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:28,370
hasn't quite work the cards too bendy it

259
00:08:28,370 --> 00:08:30,250
hasn't quite work the cards too bendy it
should have gone gone like that but what

260
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:30,260
should have gone gone like that but what

261
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:32,380
should have gone gone like that but what
I'm really interested in here is all the

262
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:32,390
I'm really interested in here is all the

263
00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:35,050
I'm really interested in here is all the
different arms with a flower stuck onto

264
00:08:35,050 --> 00:08:35,060
different arms with a flower stuck onto

265
00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:37,839
different arms with a flower stuck onto
the end of it so this is an example of

266
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:37,849
the end of it so this is an example of

267
00:08:37,849 --> 00:08:38,580
the end of it so this is an example of
the

268
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:38,590
the

269
00:08:38,590 --> 00:08:41,159
the
mechanism when you open that up it's got

270
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:41,169
mechanism when you open that up it's got

271
00:08:41,169 --> 00:08:43,380
mechanism when you open that up it's got
six planes it's got two on the top here

272
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:43,390
six planes it's got two on the top here

273
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:45,510
six planes it's got two on the top here
then it's got two underneath here and

274
00:08:45,510 --> 00:08:45,520
then it's got two underneath here and

275
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:48,090
then it's got two underneath here and
here and so any of those can have arms

276
00:08:48,090 --> 00:08:48,100
here and so any of those can have arms

277
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:50,670
here and so any of those can have arms
sticking out with flowers or hearts

278
00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:50,680
sticking out with flowers or hearts

279
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:52,230
sticking out with flowers or hearts
stuck on the end you can also make

280
00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:52,240
stuck on the end you can also make

281
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,050
stuck on the end you can also make
counter poles of these if you have a

282
00:08:54,050 --> 00:08:54,060
counter poles of these if you have a

283
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:57,420
counter poles of these if you have a
extra cut there you can bend this down

284
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:57,430
extra cut there you can bend this down

285
00:08:57,430 --> 00:09:01,440
extra cut there you can bend this down
bend it back push that through and so

286
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:01,450
bend it back push that through and so

287
00:09:01,450 --> 00:09:02,670
bend it back push that through and so
again there you are you've created

288
00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:02,680
again there you are you've created

289
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:04,590
again there you are you've created
another two planes so you can do that

290
00:09:04,590 --> 00:09:04,600
another two planes so you can do that

291
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:07,650
another two planes so you can do that
all over it and end up creating

292
00:09:07,650 --> 00:09:07,660
all over it and end up creating

293
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:11,490
all over it and end up creating
something like this other mechanisms

294
00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:11,500
something like this other mechanisms

295
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:14,760
something like this other mechanisms
that you can use of the zigzag fold so

296
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:14,770
that you can use of the zigzag fold so

297
00:09:14,770 --> 00:09:18,170
that you can use of the zigzag fold so
this is tutorial 20 is a zigzag fold

298
00:09:18,170 --> 00:09:18,180
this is tutorial 20 is a zigzag fold

299
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:21,810
this is tutorial 20 is a zigzag fold
I've made a couple of cuts as it stood

300
00:09:21,810 --> 00:09:21,820
I've made a couple of cuts as it stood

301
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:24,780
I've made a couple of cuts as it stood
originally it would have been like this

302
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:24,790
originally it would have been like this

303
00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:27,240
originally it would have been like this
and then I've added extra cuts increases

304
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:27,250
and then I've added extra cuts increases

305
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:30,030
and then I've added extra cuts increases
so it's generating more planes and you

306
00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:30,040
so it's generating more planes and you

307
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:32,519
so it's generating more planes and you
can take these little arms and you can

308
00:09:32,519 --> 00:09:32,529
can take these little arms and you can

309
00:09:32,529 --> 00:09:48,950
can take these little arms and you can
stick them on shutting up shutting out

310
00:09:48,950 --> 00:09:48,960


311
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:53,910
coming up at odd angles again every time

312
00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:53,920
coming up at odd angles again every time

313
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:56,700
coming up at odd angles again every time
you add stuff shut it down I've got a

314
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:56,710
you add stuff shut it down I've got a

315
00:09:56,710 --> 00:09:58,320
you add stuff shut it down I've got a
couple sticking out here those could be

316
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:58,330
couple sticking out here those could be

317
00:09:58,330 --> 00:10:00,600
couple sticking out here those could be
trimmed off but you just keep adding

318
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:00,610
trimmed off but you just keep adding

319
00:10:00,610 --> 00:10:04,140
trimmed off but you just keep adding
arms to it building up a complicated

320
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:04,150
arms to it building up a complicated

321
00:10:04,150 --> 00:10:06,150
arms to it building up a complicated
array of arms that you can then stick

322
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:06,160
array of arms that you can then stick

323
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,310
array of arms that you can then stick
your hearts or flowers or stars or

324
00:10:08,310 --> 00:10:08,320
your hearts or flowers or stars or

325
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,950
your hearts or flowers or stars or
whatever you feel like onto gliding

326
00:10:10,950 --> 00:10:10,960
whatever you feel like onto gliding

327
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:14,190
whatever you feel like onto gliding
around a bit I'm afraid no and then

328
00:10:14,190 --> 00:10:14,200
around a bit I'm afraid no and then

329
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:18,630
around a bit I'm afraid no and then
again you can add to those so you make a

330
00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:18,640
again you can add to those so you make a

331
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:21,930
again you can add to those so you make a
more complicated structure with everyone

332
00:10:21,930 --> 00:10:21,940
more complicated structure with everyone

333
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:26,970
more complicated structure with everyone
going back like this

334
00:10:26,970 --> 00:10:26,980


335
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:32,160
I have another one coming coming down

336
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:32,170
I have another one coming coming down

337
00:10:32,170 --> 00:10:36,720
I have another one coming coming down
off that one there and of course they

338
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:36,730
off that one there and of course they

339
00:10:36,730 --> 00:10:38,490
off that one there and of course they
don't have to actually be stuck on the

340
00:10:38,490 --> 00:10:38,500
don't have to actually be stuck on the

341
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:43,009
don't have to actually be stuck on the
end so you can know maybe put one here

342
00:10:43,009 --> 00:10:43,019
end so you can know maybe put one here

343
00:10:43,019 --> 00:10:49,350
end so you can know maybe put one here
give it a t-shirt so all of these can

344
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:49,360
give it a t-shirt so all of these can

345
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:59,879
give it a t-shirt so all of these can
have other hearts stuck onto them again

346
00:10:59,879 --> 00:10:59,889
have other hearts stuck onto them again

347
00:10:59,889 --> 00:11:02,210
have other hearts stuck onto them again
just close it make sure it's all working

348
00:11:02,210 --> 00:11:02,220
just close it make sure it's all working

349
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:04,829
just close it make sure it's all working
I've goofed here it's actually sticking

350
00:11:04,829 --> 00:11:04,839
I've goofed here it's actually sticking

351
00:11:04,839 --> 00:11:06,990
I've goofed here it's actually sticking
out of the edge but that's the thing

352
00:11:06,990 --> 00:11:07,000
out of the edge but that's the thing

353
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,030
out of the edge but that's the thing
with popper you have to make dummies and

354
00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:09,040
with popper you have to make dummies and

355
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,740
with popper you have to make dummies and
experiment and just see that everything

356
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:10,750
experiment and just see that everything

357
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:12,509
experiment and just see that everything
is actually fitting you're fitting in

358
00:11:12,509 --> 00:11:12,519
is actually fitting you're fitting in

359
00:11:12,519 --> 00:11:14,340
is actually fitting you're fitting in
within the base when you close it but

360
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:14,350
within the base when you close it but

361
00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:16,079
within the base when you close it but
you understand the basic technique that

362
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:16,089
you understand the basic technique that

363
00:11:16,089 --> 00:11:20,360
you understand the basic technique that
I've used here there's another type of

364
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:20,370
I've used here there's another type of

365
00:11:20,370 --> 00:11:24,329
I've used here there's another type of
mechanism this one is based on a

366
00:11:24,329 --> 00:11:24,339
mechanism this one is based on a

367
00:11:24,339 --> 00:11:27,030
mechanism this one is based on a
spreading Roberts a Buddhist book Alice

368
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:27,040
spreading Roberts a Buddhist book Alice

369
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:29,699
spreading Roberts a Buddhist book Alice
in Wonderland so this is based on the

370
00:11:29,699 --> 00:11:29,709
in Wonderland so this is based on the

371
00:11:29,709 --> 00:11:33,600
in Wonderland so this is based on the
art lifting small 3d shapes that then

00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:33,610
art lifting small 3d shapes that then

373
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:36,300
art lifting small 3d shapes that then
have they're actually rectangles stuck

374
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:36,310
have they're actually rectangles stuck

375
00:11:36,310 --> 00:11:37,879
have they're actually rectangles stuck
onto them but they could just as easily

376
00:11:37,879 --> 00:11:37,889
onto them but they could just as easily

377
00:11:37,889 --> 00:11:42,120
onto them but they could just as easily

is obviously a rough when you close it

398
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:12,130
is obviously a rough when you close it

399
00:12:12,130 --> 00:12:14,040
is obviously a rough when you close it
you can see they're all sticking out of

400
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:14,050
you can see they're all sticking out of

401
00:12:14,050 --> 00:12:15,930
you can see they're all sticking out of
the edge I'd need to make another one

402
00:12:15,930 --> 00:12:15,940
the edge I'd need to make another one

403
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:18,660
the edge I'd need to make another one
with that in mind bringing everything

404
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:18,670
with that in mind bringing everything

405
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:21,389
with that in mind bringing everything
down to size so it stays in the base so

406
00:12:21,389 --> 00:12:21,399
down to size so it stays in the base so

407
00:12:21,399 --> 00:12:23,309
down to size so it stays in the base so
there isn't actually a tutorial on how

408
00:12:23,309 --> 00:12:23,319
there isn't actually a tutorial on how

409
00:12:23,319 --> 00:12:25,019
there isn't actually a tutorial on how
to make an arch so I'll just show you

410
00:12:25,019 --> 00:12:25,029
to make an arch so I'll just show you

411
00:12:25,029 --> 00:12:27,660
to make an arch so I'll just show you
quickly how to make an arch shape so you

412
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:27,670
quickly how to make an arch shape so you

413
00:12:27,670 --> 00:12:29,250
quickly how to make an arch shape so you
can build the underlying structure of

414
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:29,260
can build the underlying structure of

415
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:32,430
can build the underlying structure of
this one here's the base sheet you're

416
00:12:32,430 --> 00:12:32,440
this one here's the base sheet you're

417
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:35,370
this one here's the base sheet you're
gonna build a basically it's a acute

418
00:12:35,370 --> 00:12:35,380
gonna build a basically it's a acute

419
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:37,470
gonna build a basically it's a acute
angle v-fold built onto that

420
00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:37,480
angle v-fold built onto that

421
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:43,370
angle v-fold built onto that
so we take half a sheet fold it in half

422
00:12:43,370 --> 00:12:43,380
so we take half a sheet fold it in half

423
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:46,860
so we take half a sheet fold it in half
this is all in tutorial - how to make an

424
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:46,870
this is all in tutorial - how to make an

425
00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:52,500
this is all in tutorial - how to make an
acute angle refold fold it well fold

426
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:52,510
acute angle refold fold it well fold

427
00:12:52,510 --> 00:12:54,509
acute angle refold fold it well fold
this up this is a crease side so you're

428
00:12:54,509 --> 00:12:54,519
this up this is a crease side so you're

429
00:12:54,519 --> 00:13:00,050
this up this is a crease side so you're
folding it up at a bit of an angle

430
00:13:00,050 --> 00:13:00,060


431
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:05,160
please see it well and then you cut this

432
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:05,170
please see it well and then you cut this

433
00:13:05,170 --> 00:13:14,310
please see it well and then you cut this
down to make a couple of gluing tabs so

434
00:13:14,310 --> 00:13:14,320
down to make a couple of gluing tabs so

435
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:17,189
down to make a couple of gluing tabs so
this will be gluing up at the back of

436
00:13:17,189 --> 00:13:17,199
this will be gluing up at the back of

437
00:13:17,199 --> 00:13:19,889
this will be gluing up at the back of
the page like this but you want it to be

438
00:13:19,889 --> 00:13:19,899
the page like this but you want it to be

439
00:13:19,899 --> 00:13:25,139
the page like this but you want it to be
an arch so if you just cut an arch way

440
00:13:25,139 --> 00:13:25,149
an arch so if you just cut an arch way

441
00:13:25,149 --> 00:13:27,930
an arch so if you just cut an arch way
away and then stick it on randomly you

442
00:13:27,930 --> 00:13:27,940
away and then stick it on randomly you

443
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:29,730
away and then stick it on randomly you
might well get it a sort of twisting

444
00:13:29,730 --> 00:13:29,740
might well get it a sort of twisting

445
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:31,949
might well get it a sort of twisting
shape and not very stable shape so you

446
00:13:31,949 --> 00:13:31,959
shape and not very stable shape so you

447
00:13:31,959 --> 00:13:34,439
shape and not very stable shape so you
need to first of all you work out what

448
00:13:34,439 --> 00:13:34,449
need to first of all you work out what

449
00:13:34,449 --> 00:13:36,810
need to first of all you work out what
angle you want the basic pop-up to be

450
00:13:36,810 --> 00:13:36,820
angle you want the basic pop-up to be

451
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:38,579
angle you want the basic pop-up to be
but what the why do you go the more

452
00:13:38,579 --> 00:13:38,589
but what the why do you go the more

453
00:13:38,589 --> 00:13:41,040
but what the why do you go the more
it'll lie down and the narrower you come

454
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:41,050
it'll lie down and the narrower you come

455
00:13:41,050 --> 00:13:43,500
it'll lie down and the narrower you come
on the base the more it will stand up so

456
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:43,510
on the base the more it will stand up so

457
00:13:43,510 --> 00:13:47,160
on the base the more it will stand up so
the same will go something like this now

458
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:47,170
the same will go something like this now

459
00:13:47,170 --> 00:13:50,009
the same will go something like this now
you need to mark the angle on one side

460
00:13:50,009 --> 00:13:50,019
you need to mark the angle on one side

461
00:13:50,019 --> 00:13:53,970
you need to mark the angle on one side
where it sticks down so take a pencil

462
00:13:53,970 --> 00:13:53,980
where it sticks down so take a pencil

463
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:57,180
where it sticks down so take a pencil
here I marked this angle and then the

464
00:13:57,180 --> 00:13:57,190
here I marked this angle and then the

465
00:13:57,190 --> 00:13:59,009
here I marked this angle and then the
really important thing is you also mark

466
00:13:59,009 --> 00:13:59,019
really important thing is you also mark

467
00:13:59,019 --> 00:14:04,079
really important thing is you also mark
the end of that edge so here's the line

468
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:04,089
the end of that edge so here's the line

469
00:14:04,089 --> 00:14:06,660
the end of that edge so here's the line
here's the end of it that's the really

470
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:06,670
here's the end of it that's the really

471
00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:08,639
here's the end of it that's the really
crucial thing now you can cut the arch

472
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:08,649
crucial thing now you can cut the arch

473
00:14:08,649 --> 00:14:13,500
crucial thing now you can cut the arch
out so we'll just cut a piece out like

474
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:13,510
out so we'll just cut a piece out like

475
00:14:13,510 --> 00:14:17,750
out so we'll just cut a piece out like
this

476
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:17,760


477
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:20,879
and I'm going to before I stick it down

478
00:14:20,879 --> 00:14:20,889
and I'm going to before I stick it down

479
00:14:20,889 --> 00:14:22,439
and I'm going to before I stick it down
I'm going to make another counter fold

480
00:14:22,439 --> 00:14:22,449
I'm going to make another counter fold

481
00:14:22,449 --> 00:14:24,180
I'm going to make another counter fold
just in the top so that's to give it a

482
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:24,190
just in the top so that's to give it a

483
00:14:24,190 --> 00:14:27,660
just in the top so that's to give it a
bit more interest I think so buddha did

484
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:27,670
bit more interest I think so buddha did

485
00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:31,670
bit more interest I think so buddha did
that in his Alice in Wonderland example

486
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:31,680
that in his Alice in Wonderland example

487
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:35,129
that in his Alice in Wonderland example
no here we are this is going to stick

488
00:14:35,129 --> 00:14:35,139
no here we are this is going to stick

489
00:14:35,139 --> 00:14:39,540
no here we are this is going to stick
down to the base and so the important

490
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:39,550
down to the base and so the important

491
00:14:39,550 --> 00:14:41,670
down to the base and so the important
thing is you stick to decrease against

492
00:14:41,670 --> 00:14:41,680
thing is you stick to decrease against

493
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:45,600
thing is you stick to decrease against
the line and you put the outside edge up

494
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:45,610
the line and you put the outside edge up

495
00:14:45,610 --> 00:14:47,490
the line and you put the outside edge up
against that mark so you know it's

496
00:14:47,490 --> 00:14:47,500
against that mark so you know it's

497
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:50,910
against that mark so you know it's
exactly where it was when you first test

498
00:14:50,910 --> 00:14:50,920
exactly where it was when you first test

499
00:14:50,920 --> 00:15:01,200
exactly where it was when you first test
so put the glue on one side to the line

500
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:01,210
so put the glue on one side to the line

501
00:15:01,210 --> 00:15:06,460
so put the glue on one side to the line
into that final mark and then you can

502
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:06,470
into that final mark and then you can

503
00:15:06,470 --> 00:15:10,060
into that final mark and then you can
close the whole thing down put glue on

504
00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:10,070
close the whole thing down put glue on

505
00:15:10,070 --> 00:15:26,290
close the whole thing down put glue on
the other tab and close the base so

506
00:15:26,290 --> 00:15:26,300
the other tab and close the base so

507
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:28,870
the other tab and close the base so
here's your arch shape which you can now

508
00:15:28,870 --> 00:15:28,880
here's your arch shape which you can now

509
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:31,330
here's your arch shape which you can now
build the other pieces onto again as you

510
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:31,340
build the other pieces onto again as you

511
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:33,160
build the other pieces onto again as you
close it you can see this is a dummy

512
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:33,170
close it you can see this is a dummy

513
00:15:33,170 --> 00:15:35,860
close it you can see this is a dummy
those pieces sticking out doesn't matter

514
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:35,870
those pieces sticking out doesn't matter

515
00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:38,790
those pieces sticking out doesn't matter
we might as well just trim those down

516
00:15:38,790 --> 00:15:38,800
we might as well just trim those down

517
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:41,430
we might as well just trim those down
just so they all fit within the base

518
00:15:41,430 --> 00:15:41,440
just so they all fit within the base

519
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:46,630
just so they all fit within the base
please so now we shut it and that's okay

520
00:15:46,630 --> 00:15:46,640
please so now we shut it and that's okay

521
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:48,520
please so now we shut it and that's okay
now we'll add a couple of small pieces

522
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:48,530
now we'll add a couple of small pieces

523
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:53,140
now we'll add a couple of small pieces
onto it so the easiest way we're just

524
00:15:53,140 --> 00:15:53,150
onto it so the easiest way we're just

525
00:15:53,150 --> 00:16:01,150
onto it so the easiest way we're just
taking the absolutely easiest way to do

526
00:16:01,150 --> 00:16:01,160
taking the absolutely easiest way to do

527
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:05,910
taking the absolutely easiest way to do
this is to just fold a tab onto one end

528
00:16:05,910 --> 00:16:05,920


529
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:14,440
put glue on that

530
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:14,450


531
00:16:14,450 --> 00:16:21,259
fold it into a loop so you got a loop

532
00:16:21,259 --> 00:16:21,269
fold it into a loop so you got a loop

533
00:16:21,269 --> 00:16:26,240
fold it into a loop so you got a loop
like that and then squash that flat fold

534
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:26,250
like that and then squash that flat fold

535
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:30,139
like that and then squash that flat fold
it in half again there we are and fold

536
00:16:30,139 --> 00:16:30,149
it in half again there we are and fold

537
00:16:30,149 --> 00:16:33,199
it in half again there we are and fold
it back on itself now when you open this

538
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:33,209
it back on itself now when you open this

539
00:16:33,209 --> 00:16:38,300
it back on itself now when you open this
up you've got a square shape and so you

540
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:38,310
up you've got a square shape and so you

541
00:16:38,310 --> 00:16:41,210
up you've got a square shape and so you
can stick this into that gully where the

542
00:16:41,210 --> 00:16:41,220
can stick this into that gully where the

543
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:43,819
can stick this into that gully where the
arch joins the page and before I do that

544
00:16:43,819 --> 00:16:43,829
arch joins the page and before I do that

545
00:16:43,829 --> 00:16:46,730
arch joins the page and before I do that
again I'll add a couple of small counter

546
00:16:46,730 --> 00:16:46,740
again I'll add a couple of small counter

547
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:51,490
again I'll add a couple of small counter
folds I'll make a cut there bend it down

548
00:16:51,490 --> 00:16:51,500
folds I'll make a cut there bend it down

549
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:57,920
folds I'll make a cut there bend it down
bend it back push it through so now

550
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:57,930
bend it back push it through so now

551
00:16:57,930 --> 00:16:59,780
bend it back push it through so now
that's rather than just generating an

552
00:16:59,780 --> 00:16:59,790
that's rather than just generating an

553
00:16:59,790 --> 00:17:01,550
that's rather than just generating an
extra two planes we've generated an

554
00:17:01,550 --> 00:17:01,560
extra two planes we've generated an

555
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:03,769
extra two planes we've generated an
extra four planes that you can stick

556
00:17:03,769 --> 00:17:03,779
extra four planes that you can stick

557
00:17:03,779 --> 00:17:06,650
extra four planes that you can stick
extra pieces on put glue on the whole

558
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:06,660
extra pieces on put glue on the whole

559
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:24,460
extra pieces on put glue on the whole
lot

560
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:24,470


561
00:17:24,470 --> 00:17:27,949
make sure this crease goes tight into

562
00:17:27,949 --> 00:17:27,959
make sure this crease goes tight into

563
00:17:27,959 --> 00:17:31,720
make sure this crease goes tight into
that gully so there it is and then we'll

564
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:31,730
that gully so there it is and then we'll

565
00:17:31,730 --> 00:17:36,980
that gully so there it is and then we'll
shut the base and press it well so make

566
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:36,990
shut the base and press it well so make

567
00:17:36,990 --> 00:17:38,810
shut the base and press it well so make
sure that's working if we do another

568
00:17:38,810 --> 00:17:38,820
sure that's working if we do another

569
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:41,480
sure that's working if we do another
similar thing on the other side I'll

570
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:41,490
similar thing on the other side I'll

571
00:17:41,490 --> 00:17:42,680
similar thing on the other side I'll
show you a different way of making it

572
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:42,690
show you a different way of making it

573
00:17:42,690 --> 00:17:44,990
show you a different way of making it
this time just come up with an angle in

574
00:17:44,990 --> 00:17:45,000
this time just come up with an angle in

575
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,110
this time just come up with an angle in
this case we don't want such a big piece

576
00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:48,120
this case we don't want such a big piece

577
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:49,990
this case we don't want such a big piece
I'm not going to make it a complete loop

578
00:17:49,990 --> 00:17:50,000
I'm not going to make it a complete loop

579
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:54,230
I'm not going to make it a complete loop
I'll just do something like this fold it

580
00:17:54,230 --> 00:17:54,240
I'll just do something like this fold it

581
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:59,270
I'll just do something like this fold it
in half fold an angled crease on to it

582
00:17:59,270 --> 00:17:59,280
in half fold an angled crease on to it

583
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:12,670
in half fold an angled crease on to it
so it's maybe like that pair of tabs

584
00:18:12,670 --> 00:18:12,680


585
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:15,980
this is going to be glued on like this

586
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:15,990
this is going to be glued on like this

587
00:18:15,990 --> 00:18:17,990
this is going to be glued on like this
so it's sloping down towards the middle

588
00:18:17,990 --> 00:18:18,000
so it's sloping down towards the middle

589
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,220
so it's sloping down towards the middle
or you can actually have it the other

590
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:19,230
or you can actually have it the other

591
00:18:19,230 --> 00:18:21,440
or you can actually have it the other
way so it's actually sloping away from

592
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:21,450
way so it's actually sloping away from

593
00:18:21,450 --> 00:18:23,300
way so it's actually sloping away from
the middle I think in this case I quite

594
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:23,310
the middle I think in this case I quite

595
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:25,760
the middle I think in this case I quite
like it sloping towards the middle as

596
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:25,770
like it sloping towards the middle as

597
00:18:25,770 --> 00:18:28,520
like it sloping towards the middle as
it's not a loop like this one so you've

598
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:28,530
it's not a loop like this one so you've

599
00:18:28,530 --> 00:18:30,740
it's not a loop like this one so you've
got a crease to put into the gully you

600
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:30,750
got a crease to put into the gully you

601
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:33,140
got a crease to put into the gully you
have to measure it so you just put it in

602
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:33,150
have to measure it so you just put it in

603
00:18:33,150 --> 00:18:36,950
have to measure it so you just put it in
like that so the central crease on this

604
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:36,960
like that so the central crease on this

605
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:39,440
like that so the central crease on this
base is tight into that gully and you

606
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:39,450
base is tight into that gully and you

607
00:18:39,450 --> 00:18:41,900
base is tight into that gully and you
just mark where one of the creases lies

608
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:41,910
just mark where one of the creases lies

609
00:18:41,910 --> 00:18:44,810
just mark where one of the creases lies
on the base just mark the ends of it so

610
00:18:44,810 --> 00:18:44,820
on the base just mark the ends of it so

611
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:47,330
on the base just mark the ends of it so
you make sure you know exactly where the

612
00:18:47,330 --> 00:18:47,340
you make sure you know exactly where the

613
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:49,850
you make sure you know exactly where the
piece is going to go and now you flip it

614
00:18:49,850 --> 00:18:49,860
piece is going to go and now you flip it

615
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:52,340
piece is going to go and now you flip it
over so I put the crease into that gully

616
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:52,350
over so I put the crease into that gully

617
00:18:52,350 --> 00:18:54,290
over so I put the crease into that gully
now you're going to flip it over and

618
00:18:54,290 --> 00:18:54,300
now you're going to flip it over and

619
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:57,440
now you're going to flip it over and
stick it like that to the line so I'll

620
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:57,450
stick it like that to the line so I'll

621
00:18:57,450 --> 00:19:03,620
stick it like that to the line so I'll
put some glue you just stick one side at

622
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:03,630
put some glue you just stick one side at

623
00:19:03,630 --> 00:19:08,590
put some glue you just stick one side at
a time this time I put it on that mark

624
00:19:08,590 --> 00:19:08,600
a time this time I put it on that mark

625
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:13,970
a time this time I put it on that mark
move tightly down close it glue on the

626
00:19:13,970 --> 00:19:13,980
move tightly down close it glue on the

627
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:19,610
move tightly down close it glue on the
other tab smear the glue to the edge and

628
00:19:19,610 --> 00:19:19,620
other tab smear the glue to the edge and

629
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:21,260
other tab smear the glue to the edge and
then close the base that finds its

630
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:21,270
then close the base that finds its

631
00:19:21,270 --> 00:19:25,670
then close the base that finds its
natural sticking place on the earth

632
00:19:25,670 --> 00:19:25,680


633
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:29,220
so there it is and now both of these

634
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:29,230
so there it is and now both of these

635
00:19:29,230 --> 00:19:32,070
so there it is and now both of these
this is created a gully here and a gully

636
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:32,080
this is created a gully here and a gully

637
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:34,200
this is created a gully here and a gully
here you could build more of these maybe

638
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:34,210
here you could build more of these maybe

639
00:19:34,210 --> 00:19:37,350
here you could build more of these maybe
smaller or the same size into these the

640
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:37,360
smaller or the same size into these the

641
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:39,060
smaller or the same size into these the
same here you could build more into this

642
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:39,070
same here you could build more into this

643
00:19:39,070 --> 00:19:45,090
same here you could build more into this
and this if we look at this one look at

644
00:19:45,090 --> 00:19:45,100
and this if we look at this one look at

645
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:48,690
and this if we look at this one look at
it end on you can see there's a square

646
00:19:48,690 --> 00:19:48,700
it end on you can see there's a square

647
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:51,600
it end on you can see there's a square
one and there's a angled counter folder

648
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:51,610
one and there's a angled counter folder

649
00:19:51,610 --> 00:19:53,610
one and there's a angled counter folder
and the same on this it's got actually

650
00:19:53,610 --> 00:19:53,620
and the same on this it's got actually

651
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:56,310
and the same on this it's got actually
