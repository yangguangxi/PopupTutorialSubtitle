这是一个令人愉悦的小机制

3
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:38,150
this is a pleasing little mechanism
被称为“千斤顶”的基地

4
00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:38,160
this is a pleasing little mechanism
非常高和狭窄，当你打开

5
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:40,640
this is a pleasing little mechanism
called the jack-in-the-box the base is
它的弹出窗口比底部宽，因此

6
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:40,650
called the jack-in-the-box the base is
很不寻常的一件，所以你这样做

7
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:42,980
called the jack-in-the-box the base is
very tall and narrow and when you open
需要一把尺子，一支铅笔和一把biro

8
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:42,990
very tall and narrow and when you open
得分是它的乐趣是

9
00:00:42,990 --> 00:00:46,130
very tall and narrow and when you open
it the pop-up is wider than the base so
比身高还宽，所以当你来的时候

10
00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:46,140
it the pop-up is wider than the base so
要测量你正在测量它

11
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:48,920
it the pop-up is wider than the base so
quite an unusual piece and so you do
这样的一半，你

12
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:48,930
quite an unusual piece and so you do
用这种方式测量它始于

13
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:56,120
quite an unusual piece and so you do
need a ruler and a pencil and a biro to
一块总是对折

14
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:56,130
need a ruler and a pencil and a biro to
首先将其折叠成两半的弹出式窗口

15
00:00:56,130 --> 00:00:59,210
need a ruler and a pencil and a biro to
score it with the pleasure of it is is
这样所有东西都是对称的

16
00:00:59,210 --> 00:00:59,220
score it with the pleasure of it is is
我们将以此来衡量

17
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:01,490
score it with the pleasure of it is is
wider than it is tall so when you come
我用笔来做，这样你就可以看到

18
00:01:01,490 --> 00:01:01,500
wider than it is tall so when you come
然后我们把它的背面

19
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:03,260
wider than it is tall so when you come
to measuring you're measuring it on a
设计我要把尺子对付

20
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:03,270
to measuring you're measuring it on a
中央折痕向下做一行

21
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:05,360
to measuring you're measuring it on a
half sheet like this and you're
那边有一行

22
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:05,370
half sheet like this and you're
顶部和第二个然后你

23
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:07,760
half sheet like this and you're
measuring it this way round start with
实际需要标记第三距离

24
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:07,770
measuring it this way round start with
下来，只需要标记

25
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:09,590
measuring it this way round start with
the piece folded in half always with
中心点，所以这是基本网格

26
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:09,600
the piece folded in half always with
你将要从

27
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,830
the piece folded in half always with
pop-ups you start with it folded in half
我们将在每侧都有标签

28
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:11,840
pop-ups you start with it folded in half
在这里和这里胶合到

29
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:15,500
pop-ups you start with it folded in half
that way everything is symmetrical so
背景，然后我们需要得分

30
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:15,510
that way everything is symmetrical so
这些折痕在这里是

31
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:17,740
that way everything is symmetrical so
we're going to be measuring from that
从这里开始，你得分像

32
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:17,750
we're going to be measuring from that
那

33
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:20,900
we're going to be measuring from that
I'll do it with our pen so you can see
这也是这里，所以我们得分

34
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:20,910
I'll do it with our pen so you can see
所有这些对角线的对角线和

35
00:01:20,910 --> 00:01:22,730
I'll do it with our pen so you can see
and then we'll make that the back of the
然后切掉，所以它将是一个

36
00:01:22,730 --> 00:01:22,740
and then we'll make that the back of the
在这里停下来，所以我们远离了

37
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:24,980
and then we'll make that the back of the
design I'm putting the ruler up against
这是要粘贴的选项卡的行

38
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:24,990
design I'm putting the ruler up against
它到页面

39
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:28,400
design I'm putting the ruler up against
the central crease and do one line down
在这方面，这些也是

40
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:28,410
the central crease and do one line down
手臂，所以我们只是沿着这些线

41
00:01:28,410 --> 00:01:34,910
the central crease and do one line down
there one line down here one line across
头在这里

42
00:01:34,910 --> 00:01:34,920
there one line down here one line across
这是基本的形状，有折痕

43
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:43,850
there one line down here one line across
the top and the second one and then you
在中间，如果

44
00:01:43,850 --> 00:01:43,860
the top and the second one and then you
将它对折，然后再对折

45
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:46,969
the top and the second one and then you
actually need to mark a third distance
那些对角线，所以你就像把它折叠起来

46
00:01:46,969 --> 00:01:46,979
actually need to mark a third distance
沿着对角线，这个你

47
00:01:46,979 --> 00:01:50,480
actually need to mark a third distance
down just you just need to mark at the
沿对角线将其折叠，然后在

48
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:50,490
down just you just need to mark at the
你来把它塑造成一切

49
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:56,149
down just you just need to mark at the
central point so this is the basic grid
动作简单轻松，就像这样

50
00:01:56,149 --> 00:01:56,159
central point so this is the basic grid
然后不要忘记这些侧面标签

51
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:57,940
central point so this is the basic grid
that you're going to be working from
不要以为我给我实际得分了

52
00:01:57,940 --> 00:01:57,950
that you're going to be working from
只是让他们快速浏览

53
00:01:57,950 --> 00:02:01,430
that you're going to be working from
we're going to have tabs on each side
biro，所以它们折叠起来整齐干净

54
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:01,440
we're going to have tabs on each side
这是所有指导方针都在

55
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:03,649
we're going to have tabs on each side
here and here where it glues on to the
这个，所以我们要接受它

56
00:02:03,649 --> 00:02:03,659
here and here where it glues on to the
这样一来，所以我们需要实际

57
00:02:03,659 --> 00:02:06,440
here and here where it glues on to the
background and then we need to score to
稍微折一下就可以了

58
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:06,450
background and then we need to score to
很好，然后我在这里有一块

59
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:08,749
background and then we need to score to
make these creases here these are
这又是基本上

60
00:02:08,749 --> 00:02:08,759
make these creases here these are
大小相等，是一半

61
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:13,400
make these creases here these are
starting from here you score up like
a4但我们要坚持下去

62
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:13,410
starting from here you score up like
这样一来，您可以将其固定下来

63
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:15,320
starting from here you score up like
that
单位，我实际上要离开

64
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:15,330
that
我们可以在底部一点

65
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:22,890
that
and this one here as well so we score
稍后再玩，所以把两者都粘上

66
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:22,900
and this one here as well so we score
标签同时显示，因为我们

67
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:28,500
and this one here as well so we score
all these diagonals for diagonals and
粘平

68
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:28,510
all these diagonals for diagonals and
我要把它贴在底部上方

69
00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:31,760
all these diagonals for diagonals and
then cut it out so it's going to be a
边缘对齐中央折痕

70
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:31,770
then cut it out so it's going to be a
弹出与中央对齐

71
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:35,160
then cut it out so it's going to be a
tab down here so we cut away from that
基础的折痕，所以这里

72
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:35,170
tab down here so we cut away from that
确保它工作正常

73
00:02:35,170 --> 00:02:38,130
tab down here so we cut away from that
line that's the tab that's going to glue
现在您可以真正建立基础

74
00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:38,140
line that's the tab that's going to glue
甚至更小，您可以将其关闭，

75
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:39,240
line that's the tab that's going to glue
it to the page
看看外面的边缘有多近

76
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:39,250
it to the page
这些离顶部有多近，修剪一下

77
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:47,850
it to the page
and on this side as well these are the
它下来，所以我可以看看那里我可以看到

78
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:47,860
and on this side as well these are the
在那边修剪所有的东西

79
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:55,940
and on this side as well these are the
arms so we just cut along those lines
离开，我也可以做整个事情

80


大约窄一厘米半英寸

81
00:02:55,950 --> 00:03:11,520
the head up here
所以我也可以修剪一下

82


这个很小的卡，当您打开

83
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:14,170
here's the basic shape it's got a crease
现在出现了一个很大的盒子里的杰克

84
00:03:14,170 --> 00:03:14,180
here's the basic shape it's got a crease
当它关闭时，您会看到

85
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:16,720
here's the basic shape it's got a crease
in the middle it's easier to actually if
手臂与脊柱齐平，所以您

86
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:16,730
in the middle it's easier to actually if
不能在上方放置任何东西

87
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:18,880
in the middle it's easier to actually if
you fold it in half and then fold along
武器，但是你可以拥有任何你喜欢的东西

88
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:18,890
you fold it in half and then fold along
悬在他们下面，因为

89
00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:21,610
you fold it in half and then fold along
those diagonals so you just fold it like
关闭，您在

90
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:21,620
those diagonals so you just fold it like
手臂的底部和边缘

91
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:25,119
those diagonals so you just fold it like
that along the diagonal and this one you
卡，现在您实际上可以将其变成

92
00:03:25,119 --> 00:03:25,129
that along the diagonal and this one you
站在底座上的弹出窗口，所以这是一个

93
00:03:25,129 --> 00:03:27,699
that along the diagonal and this one you
fold it along the diagonal and then when
基础，我们只是要做一个基本的

94
00:03:27,699 --> 00:03:27,709
fold it along the diagonal and then when
直角折叠，这就是我去过的地方

95
00:03:27,709 --> 00:03:29,259
fold it along the diagonal and then when
you come to push it into shape it all
将此空间留在底部a

96
00:03:29,259 --> 00:03:29,269
you come to push it into shape it all
厘米，所以我实际上

97
00:03:29,269 --> 00:03:35,220
you come to push it into shape it all
moves nice and easy so it goes like that
得分，并使其成对

98
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:35,230
moves nice and easy so it goes like that
标签，然后像所有这些一样

99
00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:39,059
moves nice and easy so it goes like that
and then don't forget these side tabs
只需要在下面剪掉那个角

100
00:03:39,059 --> 00:03:39,069
and then don't forget these side tabs
所有折痕都匹配的地方，我会削减

101
00:03:39,069 --> 00:03:41,589
and then don't forget these side tabs
don't think I scored those actually I'll
关闭这些，因此现在可以变成一个

00:03:41,589 --> 00:03:41,599
don't think I scored those actually I'll
在我推过的页面上翻折

103
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:44,410
don't think I scored those actually I'll
just give them a quick run over with the

just give them a quick run over with the
要坐在上面

105
00:03:44,420 --> 00:04:00,220
just give them a quick run over with the

你只要把这些折叠起来

106
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:00,230
biro so they fold nice and cleanly so
在这样的底座上，您需要在附近

107
00:04:00,230 --> 00:04:02,740
biro so they fold nice and cleanly so
here it is all the guide lines are on
卡的正面，使其关闭

108
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:02,750
here it is all the guide lines are on
它会以这种方式折叠，我们

109
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:04,300
here it is all the guide lines are on
this one so we're going to take it on
只需确保它适合

00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:04,310
this one so we're going to take it on
在基本卡的角落和

111

113
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:09,460
that way round so we need to actually
refold it slightly just so it all works
我将胶水都放在他们身上

114
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:09,470
refold it slightly just so it all works
正确，所以我们将其放置在
