00:00:35,890 --> 00:00:35,900


3
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:38,150
this is a pleasing little mechanism

4
00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:38,160
this is a pleasing little mechanism

5
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:40,640
this is a pleasing little mechanism
called the jack-in-the-box the base is

6
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:40,650
called the jack-in-the-box the base is

7
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:42,980
called the jack-in-the-box the base is
very tall and narrow and when you open

8
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:42,990
very tall and narrow and when you open

9
00:00:42,990 --> 00:00:46,130
very tall and narrow and when you open
it the pop-up is wider than the base so

10
00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:46,140
it the pop-up is wider than the base so

11
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:48,920
it the pop-up is wider than the base so
quite an unusual piece and so you do

12
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:48,930
quite an unusual piece and so you do

13
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:56,120
quite an unusual piece and so you do
need a ruler and a pencil and a biro to

14
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:56,130
need a ruler and a pencil and a biro to

15
00:00:56,130 --> 00:00:59,210
need a ruler and a pencil and a biro to
score it with the pleasure of it is is

16
00:00:59,210 --> 00:00:59,220
score it with the pleasure of it is is

17
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:01,490
score it with the pleasure of it is is
wider than it is tall so when you come

18
00:01:01,490 --> 00:01:01,500
wider than it is tall so when you come

19
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:03,260
wider than it is tall so when you come
to measuring you're measuring it on a

20
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:03,270
to measuring you're measuring it on a

21
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:05,360
to measuring you're measuring it on a
half sheet like this and you're

22
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:05,370
half sheet like this and you're

23
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:07,760
half sheet like this and you're
measuring it this way round start with

24
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:07,770
measuring it this way round start with

25
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:09,590
measuring it this way round start with
the piece folded in half always with

26
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:09,600
the piece folded in half always with

27
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,830
the piece folded in half always with
pop-ups you start with it folded in half

28
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:11,840
pop-ups you start with it folded in half

29
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:15,500
pop-ups you start with it folded in half
that way everything is symmetrical so

30
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:15,510
that way everything is symmetrical so

31
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:17,740
that way everything is symmetrical so
we're going to be measuring from that

32
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:17,750
we're going to be measuring from that

33
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:20,900
we're going to be measuring from that
I'll do it with our pen so you can see

34
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:20,910
I'll do it with our pen so you can see

35
00:01:20,910 --> 00:01:22,730
I'll do it with our pen so you can see
and then we'll make that the back of the

36
00:01:22,730 --> 00:01:22,740
and then we'll make that the back of the

37
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:24,980
and then we'll make that the back of the
design I'm putting the ruler up against

38
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:24,990
design I'm putting the ruler up against

39
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:28,400
design I'm putting the ruler up against
the central crease and do one line down

40
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:28,410
the central crease and do one line down

41
00:01:28,410 --> 00:01:34,910
the central crease and do one line down
there one line down here one line across

42
00:01:34,910 --> 00:01:34,920
there one line down here one line across

43
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:43,850
there one line down here one line across
the top and the second one and then you

44
00:01:43,850 --> 00:01:43,860
the top and the second one and then you

45
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:46,969
the top and the second one and then you
actually need to mark a third distance

46
00:01:46,969 --> 00:01:46,979
actually need to mark a third distance

47
00:01:46,979 --> 00:01:50,480
actually need to mark a third distance
down just you just need to mark at the

48
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:50,490
down just you just need to mark at the

49
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:56,149
down just you just need to mark at the
central point so this is the basic grid

50
00:01:56,149 --> 00:01:56,159
central point so this is the basic grid

51
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:57,940
central point so this is the basic grid
that you're going to be working from

52
00:01:57,940 --> 00:01:57,950
that you're going to be working from

53
00:01:57,950 --> 00:02:01,430
that you're going to be working from
we're going to have tabs on each side

54
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:01,440
we're going to have tabs on each side

55
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:03,649
we're going to have tabs on each side
here and here where it glues on to the

56
00:02:03,649 --> 00:02:03,659
here and here where it glues on to the

57
00:02:03,659 --> 00:02:06,440
here and here where it glues on to the
background and then we need to score to

58
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:06,450
background and then we need to score to

59
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:08,749
background and then we need to score to
make these creases here these are

60
00:02:08,749 --> 00:02:08,759
make these creases here these are

61
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:13,400
make these creases here these are
starting from here you score up like

62
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:13,410
starting from here you score up like

63
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:15,320
starting from here you score up like
that

64
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:15,330
that

65
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:22,890
that
and this one here as well so we score

66
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:22,900
and this one here as well so we score

67
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:28,500
and this one here as well so we score
all these diagonals for diagonals and

68
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:28,510
all these diagonals for diagonals and

69
00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:31,760
all these diagonals for diagonals and
then cut it out so it's going to be a

70
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:31,770
then cut it out so it's going to be a

71
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:35,160
then cut it out so it's going to be a
tab down here so we cut away from that

72
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:35,170
tab down here so we cut away from that

73
00:02:35,170 --> 00:02:38,130
tab down here so we cut away from that
line that's the tab that's going to glue

74
00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:38,140
line that's the tab that's going to glue

75
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:39,240
line that's the tab that's going to glue
it to the page

76
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:39,250
it to the page

77
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:47,850
it to the page
and on this side as well these are the

78
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:47,860
and on this side as well these are the

79
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:55,940
and on this side as well these are the
arms so we just cut along those lines

80
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:55,950


81
00:02:55,950 --> 00:03:11,520
the head up here

82
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:11,530


83
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:14,170
here's the basic shape it's got a crease

84
00:03:14,170 --> 00:03:14,180
here's the basic shape it's got a crease

85
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:16,720
here's the basic shape it's got a crease
in the middle it's easier to actually if

86
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:16,730
in the middle it's easier to actually if

87
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:18,880
in the middle it's easier to actually if
you fold it in half and then fold along

88
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:18,890
you fold it in half and then fold along

89
00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:21,610
you fold it in half and then fold along
those diagonals so you just fold it like

90
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:21,620
those diagonals so you just fold it like

91
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:25,119
those diagonals so you just fold it like
that along the diagonal and this one you

92
00:03:25,119 --> 00:03:25,129
that along the diagonal and this one you

93
00:03:25,129 --> 00:03:27,699
that along the diagonal and this one you
fold it along the diagonal and then when

94
00:03:27,699 --> 00:03:27,709
fold it along the diagonal and then when

95
00:03:27,709 --> 00:03:29,259
fold it along the diagonal and then when
you come to push it into shape it all

96
00:03:29,259 --> 00:03:29,269
you come to push it into shape it all

97
00:03:29,269 --> 00:03:35,220
you come to push it into shape it all
moves nice and easy so it goes like that

98
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:35,230
moves nice and easy so it goes like that

99
00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:39,059
moves nice and easy so it goes like that
and then don't forget these side tabs

100
00:03:39,059 --> 00:03:39,069
and then don't forget these side tabs

101
00:03:39,069 --> 00:03:41,589
and then don't forget these side tabs
don't think I scored those actually I'll

102
00:03:41,589 --> 00:03:41,599
don't think I scored those actually I'll

103
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:44,410
don't think I scored those actually I'll
just give them a quick run over with the

104
00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:44,420
just give them a quick run over with the

105
00:03:44,420 --> 00:04:00,220
just give them a quick run over with the
biro so they fold nice and cleanly so

106
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:00,230
biro so they fold nice and cleanly so

107
00:04:00,230 --> 00:04:02,740
biro so they fold nice and cleanly so
here it is all the guide lines are on

108
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:02,750
here it is all the guide lines are on

109
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:04,300
here it is all the guide lines are on
this one so we're going to take it on

110
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:04,310
this one so we're going to take it on

111
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:06,670
this one so we're going to take it on
that way round so we need to actually

112
00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:06,680
that way round so we need to actually

113
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:09,460
that way round so we need to actually
refold it slightly just so it all works

114
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:09,470
refold it slightly just so it all works

115
00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:14,069
refold it slightly just so it all works
nicely and then I've got a piece here

116
00:04:14,069 --> 00:04:14,079
nicely and then I've got a piece here

117
00:04:14,079 --> 00:04:17,319
nicely and then I've got a piece here
this again is it's the basically the

118
00:04:17,319 --> 00:04:17,329
this again is it's the basically the

119
00:04:17,329 --> 00:04:21,699
this again is it's the basically the
same size as this it's a half sheet of

120
00:04:21,699 --> 00:04:21,709
same size as this it's a half sheet of

121
00:04:21,709 --> 00:04:23,620
same size as this it's a half sheet of
a4 but that we're going to stick it on

122
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:23,630
a4 but that we're going to stick it on

123
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:26,860
a4 but that we're going to stick it on
this way round you can stick it down

124
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:26,870
this way round you can stick it down

125
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:29,560
this way round you can stick it down
flat and I'm going to actually leave a

126
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:29,570
flat and I'm going to actually leave a

127
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:31,390
flat and I'm going to actually leave a
little bit at the bottom that we can

128
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:31,400
little bit at the bottom that we can

129
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:36,520
little bit at the bottom that we can
play with later so put the glue on both

130
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:36,530
play with later so put the glue on both

131
00:04:36,530 --> 00:04:38,589
play with later so put the glue on both
tabs at the same time because we're

132
00:04:38,589 --> 00:04:38,599
tabs at the same time because we're

133
00:04:38,599 --> 00:04:46,440
tabs at the same time because we're
gluing it flat

134
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:46,450


135
00:04:46,450 --> 00:04:49,990
I'm gonna stick it just above the bottom

136
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:50,000
I'm gonna stick it just above the bottom

137
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,070
I'm gonna stick it just above the bottom
edge line up the central crease of the

138
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:54,080
edge line up the central crease of the

139
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:56,410
edge line up the central crease of the
pop up line it up with the central

140
00:04:56,410 --> 00:04:56,420
pop up line it up with the central

141
00:04:56,420 --> 00:05:00,430
pop up line it up with the central
crease of the base so here it is just

142
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:00,440
crease of the base so here it is just

143
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:07,330
crease of the base so here it is just
make sure it works nicely there we are

144
00:05:07,330 --> 00:05:07,340
make sure it works nicely there we are

145
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:09,280
make sure it works nicely there we are
and now you can actually make the base

146
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:09,290
and now you can actually make the base

147
00:05:09,290 --> 00:05:11,950
and now you can actually make the base
even smaller you can close it down and

148
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:11,960
even smaller you can close it down and

149
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:14,830
even smaller you can close it down and
just see how near the outer edge that is

150
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:14,840
just see how near the outer edge that is

151
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:19,180
just see how near the outer edge that is
how near the top these are and just trim

152
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:19,190
how near the top these are and just trim

153
00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:21,850
how near the top these are and just trim
it down so I can look in there I can see

154
00:05:21,850 --> 00:05:21,860
it down so I can look in there I can see

155
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:24,160
it down so I can look in there I can see
it's to about there and trim all that

156
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:24,170
it's to about there and trim all that

157
00:05:24,170 --> 00:05:28,440
it's to about there and trim all that
off and I can also make the whole thing

158
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:28,450
off and I can also make the whole thing

159
00:05:28,450 --> 00:05:31,570
off and I can also make the whole thing
about a centimeter half an inch narrower

160
00:05:31,570 --> 00:05:31,580
about a centimeter half an inch narrower

161
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:39,790
about a centimeter half an inch narrower
so I can trim this off as well we've got

162
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:39,800
so I can trim this off as well we've got

163
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,830
so I can trim this off as well we've got
this quite small card that when you open

164
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:41,840
this quite small card that when you open

165
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:45,610
this quite small card that when you open
it quite a big Jack in a box appears now

166
00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:45,620
it quite a big Jack in a box appears now

167
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:48,640
it quite a big Jack in a box appears now
when it closes you'll see the top of the

168
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:48,650
when it closes you'll see the top of the

169
00:05:48,650 --> 00:05:51,550
when it closes you'll see the top of the
arms come up flush with the spine so you

170
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:51,560
arms come up flush with the spine so you

171
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:54,100
arms come up flush with the spine so you
can't put anything above the top of the

172
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:54,110
can't put anything above the top of the

173
00:05:54,110 --> 00:05:55,530
can't put anything above the top of the
arms but you can have anything you like

174
00:05:55,530 --> 00:05:55,540
arms but you can have anything you like

175
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:58,780
arms but you can have anything you like
hanging down below them because as it

176
00:05:58,780 --> 00:05:58,790
hanging down below them because as it

177
00:05:58,790 --> 00:06:01,390
hanging down below them because as it
closes you've got that space between the

178
00:06:01,390 --> 00:06:01,400
closes you've got that space between the

179
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:03,520
closes you've got that space between the
bottom of the arm and the edge of the

180
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:03,530
bottom of the arm and the edge of the

181
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:06,790
bottom of the arm and the edge of the
card now you can actually turn this into

182
00:06:06,790 --> 00:06:06,800
card now you can actually turn this into

183
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:10,180
card now you can actually turn this into
a pop-up standing on a base so here's a

184
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:10,190
a pop-up standing on a base so here's a

185
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:12,300
a pop-up standing on a base so here's a
base we're just going to make a basic

186
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:12,310
base we're just going to make a basic

187
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:15,159
base we're just going to make a basic
right angled refold so that's where I've

188
00:06:15,159 --> 00:06:15,169
right angled refold so that's where I've

189
00:06:15,169 --> 00:06:17,290
right angled refold so that's where I've
left this space at the bottom a

190
00:06:17,290 --> 00:06:17,300
left this space at the bottom a

191
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:19,170
left this space at the bottom a
centimeter there so I could actually

192
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:19,180
centimeter there so I could actually

193
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:23,200
centimeter there so I could actually
score that and make that into a pair of

194
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:23,210
score that and make that into a pair of

195
00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:31,900
score that and make that into a pair of
tabs and then as with all of these you

196
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:31,910
tabs and then as with all of these you

197
00:06:31,910 --> 00:06:34,870
tabs and then as with all of these you
just need to cut out that corner below

198
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:34,880
just need to cut out that corner below

199
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:37,030
just need to cut out that corner below
where all the creases match and I'll cut

200
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:37,040
where all the creases match and I'll cut

201
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:41,280
where all the creases match and I'll cut
off those so this can now turn into a

202
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:41,290
off those so this can now turn into a

203
00:06:41,290 --> 00:06:44,380
off those so this can now turn into a
v-fold rising off the page I've pushed

204
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:44,390
v-fold rising off the page I've pushed

205
00:06:44,390 --> 00:06:50,050
v-fold rising off the page I've pushed
that in too far there we are so this is

206
00:06:50,050 --> 00:06:50,060
that in too far there we are so this is

207
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:52,490
that in too far there we are so this is
going to sit on it

208
00:06:52,490 --> 00:06:52,500
going to sit on it

209
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:59,460
going to sit on it
you just fold these this is going to sit

210
00:06:59,460 --> 00:06:59,470
you just fold these this is going to sit

211
00:06:59,470 --> 00:07:02,430
you just fold these this is going to sit
on the base like this you need it near

212
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:02,440
on the base like this you need it near

213
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:05,700
on the base like this you need it near
the front of your card so as it closes

214
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:05,710
the front of your card so as it closes

215
00:07:05,710 --> 00:07:08,940
the front of your card so as it closes
it's going to fold down this way and we

216
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:08,950
it's going to fold down this way and we

217
00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:10,470
it's going to fold down this way and we
just need to make sure it's going to fit

218
00:07:10,470 --> 00:07:10,480
just need to make sure it's going to fit

219
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:13,590
just need to make sure it's going to fit
within the corners of the base cards and

220
00:07:13,590 --> 00:07:13,600
within the corners of the base cards and

221
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:17,880
within the corners of the base cards and
in this case glue one side and stick

222
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:17,890
in this case glue one side and stick

223
00:07:17,890 --> 00:07:20,700
in this case glue one side and stick
that down and then the other side so

224
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:20,710
that down and then the other side so

225
00:07:20,710 --> 00:07:23,130
that down and then the other side so
I'll put glue on them both to start off

226
00:07:23,130 --> 00:07:23,140
I'll put glue on them both to start off

227
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:30,060
I'll put glue on them both to start off
with right so we've position it on the

228
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:30,070
with right so we've position it on the

229
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:34,440
with right so we've position it on the
base it's all fitting nicely within the

230
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:34,450
base it's all fitting nicely within the

231
00:07:34,450 --> 00:07:37,980
base it's all fitting nicely within the
base card that side stuck down close

232
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:37,990
base card that side stuck down close

233
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:39,960
base card that side stuck down close
that close the base that finds where it

234
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:39,970
that close the base that finds where it

235
00:07:39,970 --> 00:07:45,600
that close the base that finds where it
wants to be okay up and there's the

236
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:45,610
wants to be okay up and there's the

237
00:07:45,610 --> 00:07:49,050
wants to be okay up and there's the
pop-up now in actual fact we've got too

238
00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:49,060
pop-up now in actual fact we've got too

239
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:51,180
pop-up now in actual fact we've got too
much background here that is not really

240
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:51,190
much background here that is not really

241
00:07:51,190 --> 00:07:53,760
much background here that is not really
necessary so we can just cut a load of

242
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:53,770
necessary so we can just cut a load of

243
00:07:53,770 --> 00:08:04,650
necessary so we can just cut a load of
that off you can cut it in from here you

244
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:04,660
that off you can cut it in from here you

245
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:06,690
that off you can cut it in from here you
might actually want even less so we

246
00:08:06,690 --> 00:08:06,700
might actually want even less so we

247
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:10,200
might actually want even less so we
could take the the craft knife and just

248
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:10,210
could take the the craft knife and just

249
00:08:10,210 --> 00:08:12,870
could take the the craft knife and just
cut a whole lot more off cutting down

250
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:12,880
cut a whole lot more off cutting down

251
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:16,380
cut a whole lot more off cutting down
here I probably should have done this

252
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:16,390
here I probably should have done this

253
00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:25,650
here I probably should have done this
before sticking it to the base and the

254
00:08:25,650 --> 00:08:25,660
before sticking it to the base and the

255
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:36,170
before sticking it to the base and the
other side

256
00:08:36,170 --> 00:08:36,180


257
00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:42,000
there we are pop-up jack-in-the-box

258
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:42,010
there we are pop-up jack-in-the-box

259
