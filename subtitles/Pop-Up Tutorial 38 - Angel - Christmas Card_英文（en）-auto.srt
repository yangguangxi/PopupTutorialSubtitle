00:00:57,989 --> 00:00:57,999
angels in them but not I mean these they

19
00:00:57,999 --> 00:01:01,489
angels in them but not I mean these they
do have some 3d wings but they're fairly

00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:04,710
all the way through there's angels but

23
00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:09,870
all the way through there's angels but
they're quite small and not super super

24
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:09,880
they're quite small and not super super

25
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:16,789
they're quite small and not super super
3d that's similar to the first bread

done there it is based on a v-fold and

50
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:04,090
done there it is based on a v-fold and

51
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:09,980
done there it is based on a v-fold and
then as a floating plane and a slot

52
00:02:09,980 --> 00:02:09,990


53
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:12,740
so now I'll show you how to make this

54
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:12,750
so now I'll show you how to make this

55
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:16,040
so now I'll show you how to make this
one and just before we go into it I'll

56
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:16,050
one and just before we go into it I'll

57
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:17,860
one and just before we go into it I'll
show you how the wings can be decorated

58
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:17,870
show you how the wings can be decorated

59
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:21,410
show you how the wings can be decorated
this is another card I made before this

60
00:02:21,410 --> 00:02:21,420
this is another card I made before this

61
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:23,900
this is another card I made before this
is a bird card you can see the bird but

62
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:23,910
is a bird card you can see the bird but

63
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:25,250
is a bird card you can see the bird but
ignore the bird it's just actually

64
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:25,260
ignore the bird it's just actually

65
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:26,660
ignore the bird it's just actually
looking at the way the wings are done

66
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:26,670
looking at the way the wings are done

67
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:28,370
looking at the way the wings are done
and the way the wings are decorated then

68
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:28,380
and the way the wings are decorated then

69
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:30,020
and the way the wings are decorated then
it's with three different tones of

70
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:30,030
it's with three different tones of

71
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:32,330
it's with three different tones of
yellow card and cut into these shapes

72
00:02:32,330 --> 00:02:32,340
yellow card and cut into these shapes

73
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:34,790
yellow card and cut into these shapes
and I just think that works really

74
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:34,800
and I just think that works really

75
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:39,140
and I just think that works really
nicely this angel is actually based on

76
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:39,150
nicely this angel is actually based on

77
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:42,050
nicely this angel is actually based on
this if you look at it underneath from

78
00:02:42,050 --> 00:02:42,060
this if you look at it underneath from

79
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:44,120
this if you look at it underneath from
end on you'll see that it is a floating

00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:44,130
end on you'll see that it is a floating

81
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:47,330
end on you'll see that it is a floating
plane the floating plane is tutorial

00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:11,630


97
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:14,360
these are the pieces you start with the

98
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:14,370
these are the pieces you start with the

99
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:16,970
these are the pieces you start with the
base sheet of course thoroughly fold it

100
00:03:16,970 --> 00:03:16,980
base sheet of course thoroughly fold it

and then to make the floating plane

102
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:20,810
and then to make the floating plane

103
00:03:20,810 --> 00:03:25,160
and then to make the floating plane
here's a piece it's got three parallel

104
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:25,170
here's a piece it's got three parallel

105
00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:29,150
here's a piece it's got three parallel
creases cut it into three so the three

106
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:29,160
creases cut it into three so the three

107
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:35,960
creases cut it into three so the three
more or less even chunks then you take

108
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:35,970
more or less even chunks then you take

109
00:03:35,970 --> 00:03:38,120
more or less even chunks then you take
the biggest one of these and this is

110
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:38,130
the biggest one of these and this is

111
00:03:38,130 --> 00:03:41,540
the biggest one of these and this is
gonna stick over the spine like this and

112
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:41,550
gonna stick over the spine like this and

113
00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:43,730
gonna stick over the spine like this and
you want this very steep the steeper it

114
00:03:43,730 --> 00:03:43,740
you want this very steep the steeper it

115
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:49,460
you want this very steep the steeper it
is the more rigid the shape it's all

116
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:49,470
is the more rigid the shape it's all

117
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:50,990
is the more rigid the shape it's all
underneath it doesn't really matter

118
00:03:50,990 --> 00:03:51,000
underneath it doesn't really matter

which way the tabs go but I'm going to

120
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:53,430
which way the tabs go but I'm going to

121
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:55,250
which way the tabs go but I'm going to
have them sticking out so I can keep the

122
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:55,260
have them sticking out so I can keep the

123
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:57,950
have them sticking out so I can keep the
central Ridge really closely into the

124
00:03:57,950 --> 00:03:57,960
central Ridge really closely into the

125
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:00,770
central Ridge really closely into the
spine so I'll put a bit of glue on that

126
00:04:00,770 --> 00:04:00,780
spine so I'll put a bit of glue on that

127
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:07,190
spine so I'll put a bit of glue on that
side there I'll stick that down it's

128
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:07,200
side there I'll stick that down it's

129
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,230
side there I'll stick that down it's
only you know maybe even only half a

only you know maybe even only half a

131
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:13,400
only you know maybe even only half a
centimeter from the spine and some more

132
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:13,410
centimeter from the spine and some more

133
00:04:13,410 --> 00:04:17,600
centimeter from the spine and some more
glue on the other tab smear it around

134
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:17,610

wants to glue down so that's the

140
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:26,960
wants to glue down so that's the

141
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,629
wants to glue down so that's the
beginning of it that's a parallel fault

142

the other two pieces are used to make

144
00:04:31,059 --> 00:04:31,069
the other two pieces are used to make

145
00:04:31,069 --> 00:04:35,050
the other two pieces are used to make
parallelograms on each side so put glue

146
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:35,060
parallelograms on each side so put glue

147
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:38,170
parallelograms on each side so put glue
on that and this time you stick the the

148
00:04:38,170 --> 00:04:38,180
on that and this time you stick the the

149
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:38,770
on that and this time you stick the the
crease

150
00:04:38,770 --> 00:04:38,780
crease

151
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:41,260
crease
absolutely flush with there the ridge on

152
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:41,270
absolutely flush with there the ridge on

153
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:47,110
absolutely flush with there the ridge on
the top of that so there's that one and

154
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:47,120
the top of that so there's that one and

155
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,180
the top of that so there's that one and
now you fold it up into its closed

156
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:49,190
now you fold it up into its closed

157
00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:56,490
now you fold it up into its closed
position put the glue on the other tab

158
00:04:56,490 --> 00:04:56,500


159
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:59,230
and now close it down so it goes into

160
00:04:59,230 --> 00:04:59,240
and now close it down so it goes into

161
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:03,129
and now close it down so it goes into
its closed position close it so it finds

162
00:05:03,129 --> 00:05:03,139
its closed position close it so it finds

163
00:05:03,139 --> 00:05:05,800
its closed position close it so it finds
where it wants to stick down put the

164
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:05,810
where it wants to stick down put the

165
00:05:05,810 --> 00:05:16,230
where it wants to stick down put the
other one on the other side

166
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:16,240

00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,580
absolutely flush with the Ridge on the

168
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:18,590
absolutely flush with the Ridge on the

00:05:18,590 --> 00:05:25,749
absolutely flush with the Ridge on the
top and put glue on the other tab well

170
00:05:25,749 --> 00:05:25,759
top and put glue on the other tab well

171
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:30,570
top and put glue on the other tab well
smear it around and then close it down

172
00:05:30,570 --> 00:05:30,580


173
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:33,339
so this is the basic floating plane you

174
00:05:33,339 --> 00:05:33,349
so this is the basic floating plane you

175
00:05:33,349 --> 00:05:34,689
so this is the basic floating plane you
look at it that way on you can see

176
00:05:34,689 --> 00:05:34,699
look at it that way on you can see

177
00:05:34,699 --> 00:05:36,279
look at it that way on you can see
there's a parallel fold in the middle

178
00:05:36,279 --> 00:05:36,289
there's a parallel fold in the middle

179
00:05:36,289 --> 00:05:38,730
there's a parallel fold in the middle
and then a parallelogram on each side

180
00:05:38,730 --> 00:05:38,740
and then a parallelogram on each side

181
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:41,769
and then a parallelogram on each side
creating these two planes above the page

182
00:05:41,769 --> 00:05:41,779
creating these two planes above the page

183
00:05:41,779 --> 00:05:47,920
creating these two planes above the page
they're both parallel with the page this

184
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:47,930
they're both parallel with the page this

185
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:50,050
they're both parallel with the page this
is the main body of the Angel needs a

186
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:50,060
is the main body of the Angel needs a

187
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:51,850
is the main body of the Angel needs a
crease down the middle that crease is

188
00:05:51,850 --> 00:05:51,860
crease down the middle that crease is

189
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:54,339
crease down the middle that crease is
going to go into the gully here I've

190
00:05:54,339 --> 00:05:54,349
going to go into the gully here I've

191
00:05:54,349 --> 00:05:56,140
going to go into the gully here I've
made it symmetrical but it doesn't need

192
00:05:56,140 --> 00:05:56,150
made it symmetrical but it doesn't need

193
00:05:56,150 --> 00:05:57,909
made it symmetrical but it doesn't need
to be you might choose to make the two

194
00:05:57,909 --> 00:05:57,919
to be you might choose to make the two

195
00:05:57,919 --> 00:05:59,980
to be you might choose to make the two
wings in different positions it really

196
00:05:59,980 --> 00:05:59,990
wings in different positions it really

197
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:01,360
wings in different positions it really
doesn't matter they're just going to

198
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:01,370
doesn't matter they're just going to

199
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:03,309
doesn't matter they're just going to
stick onto these two planes here and

200
00:06:03,309 --> 00:06:03,319
stick onto these two planes here and

201
00:06:03,319 --> 00:06:04,959
stick onto these two planes here and
it's up to you when you're designing

202
00:06:04,959 --> 00:06:04,969
it's up to you when you're designing

203
00:06:04,969 --> 00:06:08,350
it's up to you when you're designing
just play around with it we can stick

204
00:06:08,350 --> 00:06:08,360
just play around with it we can stick

205
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:09,999
just play around with it we can stick
this all at the same time we've got the

206
00:06:09,999 --> 00:06:10,009
this all at the same time we've got the

207
00:06:10,009 --> 00:06:16,209
this all at the same time we've got the
glue on both surfaces and the important

208
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:16,219
glue on both surfaces and the important

209
00:06:16,219 --> 00:06:17,769
glue on both surfaces and the important
thing is to make sure that this crease

210
00:06:17,769 --> 00:06:17,779
thing is to make sure that this crease

211
00:06:17,779 --> 00:06:21,070
thing is to make sure that this crease
goes right into that flush into that

212
00:06:21,070 --> 00:06:21,080
goes right into that flush into that

213
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:24,519
goes right into that flush into that
gully there and we'll close this just to

214
00:06:24,519 --> 00:06:24,529
gully there and we'll close this just to

215
00:06:24,529 --> 00:06:26,120
gully there and we'll close this just to
make sure it's all

216
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:26,130
make sure it's all

217
00:06:26,130 --> 00:06:32,000
make sure it's all
Safety's sound so that's the main body

218
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:32,010
Safety's sound so that's the main body

219
00:06:32,010 --> 00:06:36,080
Safety's sound so that's the main body
of it so this is the heads you can cut

220
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:36,090
of it so this is the heads you can cut

221
00:06:36,090 --> 00:06:38,840
of it so this is the heads you can cut
it out in profile you see the shape that

222
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:38,850
it out in profile you see the shape that

223
00:06:38,850 --> 00:06:40,420
it out in profile you see the shape that
you want the profile of the head to be

224
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:40,430
you want the profile of the head to be

225
00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:43,640
you want the profile of the head to be
you add a tab on each side and then

226
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:43,650
you add a tab on each side and then

227
00:06:43,650 --> 00:06:45,740
you add a tab on each side and then
there's a little slot here which can

228
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:45,750
there's a little slot here which can

229
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:47,540
there's a little slot here which can
hold the trumpet so the trumpet can go

230
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:47,550
hold the trumpet so the trumpet can go

231
00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:50,960
hold the trumpet so the trumpet can go
in and be stuck in sides here it is if

232
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:50,970
in and be stuck in sides here it is if

233
00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:52,640
in and be stuck in sides here it is if
you look at it this way you can see the

234
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:52,650
you look at it this way you can see the

235
00:06:52,650 --> 00:06:54,410
you look at it this way you can see the
trumpet goes through that's not and then

236
00:06:54,410 --> 00:06:54,420
trumpet goes through that's not and then

237
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:55,820
trumpet goes through that's not and then
there's actually slots in the hands as

238
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:55,830
there's actually slots in the hands as

239
00:06:55,830 --> 00:06:57,530
there's actually slots in the hands as
well so that holds the trumpet so it

240
00:06:57,530 --> 00:06:57,540
well so that holds the trumpet so it

241
00:06:57,540 --> 00:07:02,690
well so that holds the trumpet so it
juts directly out from the page so we

242
00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:02,700
juts directly out from the page so we

243
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:05,090
juts directly out from the page so we
stick this on it's up to you really you

244
00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:05,100
stick this on it's up to you really you

245
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:08,840
stick this on it's up to you really you
know how high or low you put it I put it

246
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:08,850
know how high or low you put it I put it

247
00:07:08,850 --> 00:07:11,630
know how high or low you put it I put it
off about half way up there it's it's up

248
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:11,640
off about half way up there it's it's up

249
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:14,810
off about half way up there it's it's up
to you this design so again I'll put

250
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:14,820
to you this design so again I'll put

251
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:24,200
to you this design so again I'll put
glue on one side this can go as flat or

252
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:24,210
glue on one side this can go as flat or

253
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:27,440
glue on one side this can go as flat or
as pointy as you like I'll stick it down

254
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:27,450
as pointy as you like I'll stick it down

255
00:07:27,450 --> 00:07:30,380
as pointy as you like I'll stick it down
there and then I'll put glue on the

256
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:30,390
there and then I'll put glue on the

257
00:07:30,390 --> 00:07:38,939
there and then I'll put glue on the
other side and close it

258
00:07:38,939 --> 00:07:38,949


259
00:07:38,949 --> 00:07:44,550
close it down so there's the head in

260
00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:44,560
close it down so there's the head in

261
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:49,980
close it down so there's the head in
place now the arms so you can see the

262
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:49,990
place now the arms so you can see the

263
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:53,100
place now the arms so you can see the
arms that actually if you look at it

264
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:53,110
arms that actually if you look at it

265
00:07:53,110 --> 00:07:54,869
arms that actually if you look at it
this way you'll see there's one fold

266
00:07:54,869 --> 00:07:54,879
this way you'll see there's one fold

267
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:57,089
this way you'll see there's one fold
here and one fault here these two folds

268
00:07:57,089 --> 00:07:57,099
here and one fault here these two folds

269
00:07:57,099 --> 00:07:59,219
here and one fault here these two folds
are parallel and then I've cut the shape

270
00:07:59,219 --> 00:07:59,229
are parallel and then I've cut the shape

271
00:07:59,229 --> 00:08:01,290
are parallel and then I've cut the shape
of the arms to give an elbow and make

272
00:08:01,290 --> 00:08:01,300
of the arms to give an elbow and make

273
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:04,260
of the arms to give an elbow and make
the arms go down and come up again to

274
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:04,270
the arms go down and come up again to

275
00:08:04,270 --> 00:08:06,390
the arms go down and come up again to
holder jumping again it's been being

276
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:06,400
holder jumping again it's been being

277
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:09,330
holder jumping again it's been being
folded in half and all cut symmetrically

278
00:08:09,330 --> 00:08:09,340
folded in half and all cut symmetrically

279
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:13,649
folded in half and all cut symmetrically
so when you open it up it gives you this

280
00:08:13,649 --> 00:08:13,659
so when you open it up it gives you this

281
00:08:13,659 --> 00:08:18,110
so when you open it up it gives you this
shape and so these tabs are gonna go in

282
00:08:18,110 --> 00:08:18,120
shape and so these tabs are gonna go in

283
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:21,679
shape and so these tabs are gonna go in
underneath they're gonna stick down

284
00:08:21,679 --> 00:08:21,689
underneath they're gonna stick down

285
00:08:21,689 --> 00:08:25,019
underneath they're gonna stick down
something like this so this is actually

286
00:08:25,019 --> 00:08:25,029
something like this so this is actually

287
00:08:25,029 --> 00:08:27,450
something like this so this is actually
parallel fold you want to be thinking

288
00:08:27,450 --> 00:08:27,460
parallel fold you want to be thinking

289
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:29,159
parallel fold you want to be thinking
about where the trumpet coming straight

290
00:08:29,159 --> 00:08:29,169
about where the trumpet coming straight

291
00:08:29,169 --> 00:08:31,619
about where the trumpet coming straight
out is going to be so you need the two

292
00:08:31,619 --> 00:08:31,629
out is going to be so you need the two

293
00:08:31,629 --> 00:08:33,630
out is going to be so you need the two
slots sort of in line with each other

294
00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:33,640
slots sort of in line with each other

295
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:36,120
slots sort of in line with each other
and again I'm just going to stick down

296
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:36,130
and again I'm just going to stick down

297
00:08:36,130 --> 00:08:43,409
and again I'm just going to stick down
one side roughly where the shoulder

298
00:08:43,409 --> 00:08:43,419
one side roughly where the shoulder

299
00:08:43,419 --> 00:08:47,550
one side roughly where the shoulder
would be that's about right it should be

300
00:08:47,550 --> 00:08:47,560
would be that's about right it should be

301
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:50,579
would be that's about right it should be
glued parallel with this crease on that

302
00:08:50,579 --> 00:08:50,589
glued parallel with this crease on that

303
00:08:50,589 --> 00:08:54,449
glued parallel with this crease on that
main body and then we put glue on the

304
00:08:54,449 --> 00:08:54,459
main body and then we put glue on the

305
00:08:54,459 --> 00:09:06,010
main body and then we put glue on the
other side and close

306
00:09:06,010 --> 00:09:06,020


307
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:09,260
this is the trumpet it's just got one

308
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:09,270
this is the trumpet it's just got one

309
00:09:09,270 --> 00:09:11,180
this is the trumpet it's just got one
little crease at the end so there's just

310
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:11,190
little crease at the end so there's just

311
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:12,770
little crease at the end so there's just
a very small tab there

312
00:09:12,770 --> 00:09:12,780
a very small tab there

313
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:14,720
a very small tab there
that's what's gonna hold the piece in

314
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:14,730
that's what's gonna hold the piece in

315
00:09:14,730 --> 00:09:20,000
that's what's gonna hold the piece in
place this is going to go like this it

316
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:20,010
place this is going to go like this it

317
00:09:20,010 --> 00:09:22,250
place this is going to go like this it
goes through the slot in my hands and

318
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:22,260
goes through the slot in my hands and

319
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:24,320
goes through the slot in my hands and
through the stuffing line it and that's

320
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:24,330
through the stuffing line it and that's

321
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:27,020
through the stuffing line it and that's
going to glue in there like that so I'll

322
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:27,030
going to glue in there like that so I'll

323
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:30,700
going to glue in there like that so I'll
just put a little bit of glue on there

324
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:30,710
just put a little bit of glue on there

325
00:09:30,710 --> 00:09:34,250
just put a little bit of glue on there
spider York would this just getting it

326
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:34,260
spider York would this just getting it
