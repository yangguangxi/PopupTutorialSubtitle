然后作为水上飞机和一个槽

27
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:19,319
anyway quite quite an interesting
所以现在我将向您展示如何制作

28
00:01:19,319 --> 00:01:19,329
anyway quite quite an interesting

done there it is based on a v-fold and
这些是您开始的作品

50
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:04,090
done there it is based on a v-fold and
当然，将基片彻底折叠

51
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:09,980
done there it is based on a v-fold and
then as a floating plane and a slot
然后做水上飞机

52


这是一块，有三个平行

53
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:12,740
so now I'll show you how to make this
折痕将其切成三个，所以三个

54
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:12,750
so now I'll show you how to make this
或多或少甚至块，然后你采取

55
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:16,040
so now I'll show you how to make this
one and just before we go into it I'll
其中最大的一个是

56
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:16,050
one and just before we go into it I'll
会像这样粘在脊椎上

57
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:17,860
one and just before we go into it I'll
show you how the wings can be decorated
你想要这个陡峭的地方

58
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:17,870
show you how the wings can be decorated
形状越坚硬

59
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:21,410
show you how the wings can be decorated
this is another card I made before this
在下面并不重要

60
00:02:21,410 --> 00:02:21,420
this is another card I made before this
选项卡走哪条路，但我要去

61
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:23,900
this is another card I made before this
is a bird card you can see the bird but
让他们伸出来，这样我就可以保持

62
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:23,910
is a bird card you can see the bird but
中央山脊真的很紧密地进入了

63
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:25,250
is a bird card you can see the bird but
ignore the bird it's just actually
脊椎，所以我会在上面放些胶水

64
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:25,260
ignore the bird it's just actually
在那边我会坚持下去

65
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:26,660
ignore the bird it's just actually
looking at the way the wings are done
只有你知道，也许只有一半

66
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:26,670
looking at the way the wings are done
距离脊柱一厘米

67
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:28,370
looking at the way the wings are done
and the way the wings are decorated then

它的开始是并行错误

72
00:02:32,330 --> 00:02:32,340
yellow card and cut into these shapes
另外两块用来

73
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:34,790
yellow card and cut into these shapes
and I just think that works really
每边平行四边形，所以放胶

74
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:34,800
and I just think that works really
在那一次，这一次你坚持

75
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:39,140
and I just think that works really
nicely this angel is actually based on

最重要的是一个

78
00:02:42,050 --> 00:02:42,060
this if you look at it underneath from
现在你把它折起来

79
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:44,120
this if you look at it underneath from
end on you'll see that it is a floating
将胶水放在另一个标签上

80
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:44,130

所以这是你的基本水上飞机

88
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:56,970
slightly angled to make it a point and
这样看就可以看到

89
00:02:56,970 --> 00:02:58,580
slightly angled to make it a point and
though it's being cut off and then the
中间有平行的折痕

90
00:02:58,580 --> 00:02:58,590
though it's being cut off and then the

hand and a slot on the head
在折痕中间向下折痕

95
00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:11,620
hand and a slot on the head
that holds the trumpet search that's out
我将要进入沟壑

96


使它对称但不需要

97
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:14,360
these are the pieces you start with the
成为你可能会选择两者

98
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:14,370
these are the pieces you start with the
翅膀在不同的位置真的

99
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:16,970
these are the pieces you start with the
base sheet of course thoroughly fold it
没关系，他们只是去

100
00:03:16,970 --> 00:03:16,980
base sheet of course thoroughly fold it
贴在这两个平面上

101
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:20,800
base sheet of course thoroughly fold it
and then to make the floating plane
在您进行设计时，取决于您

102
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:20,810
and then to make the floating plane
只是玩弄它，我们可以坚持

103
00:03:20,810 --> 00:03:25,160
and then to make the floating plane
here's a piece it's got three parallel
这一切都在同一时间，

104
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:25,170
here's a piece it's got three parallel
胶粘在两个表面上，重要的

105

creases cut it into three so the three
进入那个同花顺

107
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:35,960
creases cut it into three so the three
more or less even chunks then you take
沟壑在那里，我们将其关闭到

108
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:35,970
more or less even chunks then you take
确保一切

109
00:03:35,970 --> 00:03:38,120
more or less even chunks then you take
the biggest one of these and this is
安全的声音，这就是主体

110
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:38,130
the biggest one of these and this is
这就是你可以剪的头

111
00:03:38,130 --> 00:03:41,540
the biggest one of these and this is
gonna stick over the spine like this and
在个人资料中看到的形状

112
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:41,550
gonna stick over the spine like this and
你想要头部的轮廓是

113
00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:43,730
gonna stick over the spine like this and
you want this very steep the steeper it
您在每一侧添加一个标签，然后

114
00:03:43,730 --> 00:03:43,740
you want this very steep the steeper it
这里有一个小槽可以

115
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:49,460
you want this very steep the steeper it
is the more rigid the shape it's all
握住小号，以便小号可以走

116
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:49,470
is the more rigid the shape it's all
在里面，被困在两侧，如果

117
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:50,990
is the more rigid the shape it's all
underneath it doesn't really matter
你这样看就可以看到

118
00:03:50,990 --> 00:03:51,000
underneath it doesn't really matter
小号经过那不是然后

119
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,420
underneath it doesn't really matter
which way the tabs go but I'm going to
手中实际上有插槽

120
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:53,430
which way the tabs go but I'm going to
好，这样就可以吹小号了

121
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:55,250
which way the tabs go but I'm going to
have them sticking out so I can keep the

122
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:55,260
have them sticking out so I can keep the
坚持这取决于你真的你

123
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:57,950
have them sticking out so I can keep the
central Ridge really closely into the
知道你把它放高还是低

124
00:03:57,950 --> 00:03:57,960
central Ridge really closely into the
在大约一半的地方

125
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:00,770
central Ridge really closely into the
spine so I'll put a bit of glue on that
给你这个设计，所以我再次把

126
00:04:00,770 --> 00:04:00,780
spine so I'll put a bit of glue on that
胶在一侧可以平整或

127
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:07,190
spine so I'll put a bit of glue on that
side there I'll stick that down it's
如你所愿，我会坚持下去

128
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:07,200
side there I'll stick that down it's
在那里，然后我将胶水涂在

129
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,230
side there I'll stick that down it's
only you know maybe even only half a
另一边并关闭它

130
00:04:09,230 --> 00:04:09,240
only you know maybe even only half a
关闭它，这样就可以进入

131
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:13,400
only you know maybe even only half a
centimeter from the spine and some more
现在放置武器，以便您可以看到

132
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:13,410
centimeter from the spine and some more
武器，如果你看着它

133
00:04:13,410 --> 00:04:17,600
centimeter from the spine and some more
glue on the other tab smear it around
这样一来，您将看到一折

134
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:17,610
glue on the other tab smear it around
这里，这里有一个缺点，这两个方面

135
00:04:17,610 --> 00:04:19,539
glue on the other tab smear it around
[Music]
是平行的，然后我切出形状

136
00:04:19,539 --> 00:04:19,549
[Music]
用胳膊肘来做

137
00:04:19,549 --> 00:04:21,099
[Music]
close the base that can find where it
手臂掉下来，再次上升到

138
00:04:21,099 --> 00:04:21,109
close the base that can find where it
持有人再次跳过去

139
00:04:21,109 --> 00:04:26,950
close the base that can find where it
wants to glue down so that's the
折成两半并对称地切割

140
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:26,960
wants to glue down so that's the
所以当你打开它给你这个

141
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,629
wants to glue down so that's the
beginning of it that's a parallel fault
形状，因此这些标签将进入

142
00:04:28,629 --> 00:04:28,639
beginning of it that's a parallel fault
在它们下面

143
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:31,059
