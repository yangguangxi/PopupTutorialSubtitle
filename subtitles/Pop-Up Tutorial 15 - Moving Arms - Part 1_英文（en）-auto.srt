00:00:42,149 --> 00:00:42,159
numerous variations and uses the most

7
00:00:42,159 --> 00:00:44,009
numerous variations and uses the most
basic is based on the parallelogram

8
00:00:44,009 --> 00:00:44,019
basic is based on the parallelogram

9
00:00:44,019 --> 00:00:47,700
basic is based on the parallelogram
which we cover in tutorial 5 here it is

10
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:47,710
which we cover in tutorial 5 here it is

11
00:00:47,710 --> 00:00:50,279
which we cover in tutorial 5 here it is
the green bit is the parallelogram the

12
00:00:50,279 --> 00:00:50,289
the green bit is the parallelogram the

13
00:00:50,289 --> 00:00:52,649
the green bit is the parallelogram the
yellow bit is a basic moving arm the

14
00:00:52,649 --> 00:00:52,659
yellow bit is a basic moving arm the

15
00:00:52,659 --> 00:00:55,229
yellow bit is a basic moving arm the
pink bit is adding an elbow to the arm

16
00:00:55,229 --> 00:00:55,239
pink bit is adding an elbow to the arm

17
00:00:55,239 --> 00:00:58,739
pink bit is adding an elbow to the arm
which makes appear to move even more so

18
00:00:58,739 --> 00:00:58,749
which makes appear to move even more so

19
00:00:58,749 --> 00:01:02,250
which makes appear to move even more so
this is the basic variation here's an

20
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:02,260
this is the basic variation here's an

21
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:06,149
this is the basic variation here's an
example this is the basic parallelogram

22
00:01:06,149 --> 00:01:06,159
example this is the basic parallelogram

23
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:09,209
example this is the basic parallelogram
you can see that with four moving arms

24
00:01:09,209 --> 00:01:09,219
you can see that with four moving arms

25
00:01:09,219 --> 00:01:12,209
you can see that with four moving arms
on it four limbs or moving in slightly

26
00:01:12,209 --> 00:01:12,219
on it four limbs or moving in slightly

27
00:01:12,219 --> 00:01:15,620
on it four limbs or moving in slightly
different directions if we look at the

28
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:15,630
different directions if we look at the

29
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:20,209
different directions if we look at the
the haunted house by Lampe and Kowski

30
00:01:20,209 --> 00:01:20,219
the haunted house by Lampe and Kowski

31
00:01:20,219 --> 00:01:24,149
the haunted house by Lampe and Kowski
this has got a really good example so

32
00:01:24,149 --> 00:01:24,159
this has got a really good example so

33
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:27,149
this has got a really good example so
here's the parallelogram here are two

34
00:01:27,149 --> 00:01:27,159
here's the parallelogram here are two

35
00:01:27,159 --> 00:01:30,959
here's the parallelogram here are two
moving arms so one of them moves rotates

36
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:30,969
moving arms so one of them moves rotates

37
00:01:30,969 --> 00:01:33,359
moving arms so one of them moves rotates
against the page and you see the same

38
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:33,369
against the page and you see the same

39
00:01:33,369 --> 00:01:35,010
against the page and you see the same
side of the piece of card all the way

40
00:01:35,010 --> 00:01:35,020
side of the piece of card all the way

41
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:37,590
side of the piece of card all the way
through the other piece flips over on

42
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:37,600
through the other piece flips over on

43
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:40,050
through the other piece flips over on
the parallelogram there are two small

44
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:40,060
the parallelogram there are two small

45
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:41,669
the parallelogram there are two small
triangles and it depends which triangle

46
00:01:41,669 --> 00:01:41,679
triangles and it depends which triangle

47
00:01:41,679 --> 00:01:43,440
triangles and it depends which triangle
you stick it to if you stick it to this

48
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:43,450
you stick it to if you stick it to this

49
00:01:43,450 --> 00:01:45,179
you stick it to if you stick it to this
one which is on the small side of the

50
00:01:45,179 --> 00:01:45,189
one which is on the small side of the

51
00:01:45,189 --> 00:01:47,099
one which is on the small side of the
parallelogram that is the one that

52
00:01:47,099 --> 00:01:47,109
parallelogram that is the one that

53
00:01:47,109 --> 00:01:49,169
parallelogram that is the one that
rotates against the page so that's

54
00:01:49,169 --> 00:01:49,179
rotates against the page so that's

55
00:01:49,179 --> 00:01:51,719
rotates against the page so that's
really the most useful the other small

56
00:01:51,719 --> 00:01:51,729
really the most useful the other small

57
00:01:51,729 --> 00:01:53,190
really the most useful the other small
triangle that's the one that will make

58
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:53,200
triangle that's the one that will make

59
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:56,340
triangle that's the one that will make
the the piece of car flip over the

60
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:56,350
the the piece of car flip over the

61
00:01:56,350 --> 00:01:58,800
the the piece of car flip over the
parallelogram also creates a gully here

62
00:01:58,800 --> 00:01:58,810
parallelogram also creates a gully here

63
00:01:58,810 --> 00:02:01,800
parallelogram also creates a gully here
where it joins the page so you can stick

64
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:01,810
where it joins the page so you can stick

65
00:02:01,810 --> 00:02:07,469
where it joins the page so you can stick
moving arms in for that

66
00:02:07,469 --> 00:02:07,479


67
00:02:07,479 --> 00:02:11,740
here's an example here's the basic

68
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:11,750
here's an example here's the basic

69
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:14,680
here's an example here's the basic
parallelogram this is the moving arm

70
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:14,690
parallelogram this is the moving arm

71
00:02:14,690 --> 00:02:16,990
parallelogram this is the moving arm
we've already looked at here's two more

72
00:02:16,990 --> 00:02:17,000
we've already looked at here's two more

73
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,330
we've already looked at here's two more
small triangles stuck into this gully

74
00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:19,340
small triangles stuck into this gully

75
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:21,670
small triangles stuck into this gully
created by the parallelogram joining the

76
00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:21,680
created by the parallelogram joining the

77
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:24,369
created by the parallelogram joining the
page and so these two have two moving

78
00:02:24,369 --> 00:02:24,379
page and so these two have two moving

79
00:02:24,379 --> 00:02:26,320
page and so these two have two moving
arms stuck on and so as you see as you

80
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:26,330
arms stuck on and so as you see as you

81
00:02:26,330 --> 00:02:28,780
arms stuck on and so as you see as you
open and close it they have a different

82
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:28,790
open and close it they have a different

83
00:02:28,790 --> 00:02:33,039
open and close it they have a different
action and here's another example this

84
00:02:33,039 --> 00:02:33,049
action and here's another example this

85
00:02:33,049 --> 00:02:36,160
action and here's another example this
is this is using that type of mechanism

86
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:36,170
is this is using that type of mechanism

87
00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:38,979
is this is using that type of mechanism
so is the parallel fold through to the

88
00:02:38,979 --> 00:02:38,989
so is the parallel fold through to the

89
00:02:38,989 --> 00:02:41,350
so is the parallel fold through to the
page and we've got small triangles stuck

90
00:02:41,350 --> 00:02:41,360
page and we've got small triangles stuck

91
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:44,170
page and we've got small triangles stuck
in and so those are giving us moving

92
00:02:44,170 --> 00:02:44,180
in and so those are giving us moving

93
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:48,150
in and so those are giving us moving
arms are moving in different directions

94
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:48,160


95
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:51,819
there are numerous ways that this can be

96
00:02:51,819 --> 00:02:51,829
there are numerous ways that this can be

97
00:02:51,829 --> 00:02:54,250
there are numerous ways that this can be
used so here's a really complicated one

98
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:54,260
used so here's a really complicated one

99
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:57,250
used so here's a really complicated one
so this is this is the basic jumping

100
00:02:57,250 --> 00:02:57,260
so this is this is the basic jumping

101
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:58,660
so this is this is the basic jumping
figure that I just showed you got those

102
00:02:58,660 --> 00:02:58,670
figure that I just showed you got those

103
00:02:58,670 --> 00:03:00,220
figure that I just showed you got those
two of them there's two parallelograms

104
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:00,230
two of them there's two parallelograms

105
00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:03,520
two of them there's two parallelograms
built onto each other with these jumping

106
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:03,530
built onto each other with these jumping

107
00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:09,759
built onto each other with these jumping
figures other variations there's this

108
00:03:09,759 --> 00:03:09,769
figures other variations there's this

109
00:03:09,769 --> 00:03:13,090
figures other variations there's this
type so this is actually the the moving

110
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:13,100
type so this is actually the the moving

111
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:16,750
type so this is actually the the moving
arm appears from behind a mask so the

112
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:16,760
arm appears from behind a mask so the

113
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:19,629
arm appears from behind a mask so the
green bit is a big parallelogram and the

114
00:03:19,629 --> 00:03:19,639
green bit is a big parallelogram and the

115
00:03:19,639 --> 00:03:21,970
green bit is a big parallelogram and the
arm is actually stuck to the page at an

116
00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:21,980
arm is actually stuck to the page at an

117
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:24,339
arm is actually stuck to the page at an
angle that's what gives it the movement

118
00:03:24,339 --> 00:03:24,349
angle that's what gives it the movement

119
00:03:24,349 --> 00:03:27,309
angle that's what gives it the movement
as it opens and closes and here's

120
00:03:27,309 --> 00:03:27,319
as it opens and closes and here's

121
00:03:27,319 --> 00:03:30,490
as it opens and closes and here's
another variation of it if you look at

122
00:03:30,490 --> 00:03:30,500
another variation of it if you look at

123
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:32,080
another variation of it if you look at
it this way around you'll see those

124
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:32,090
it this way around you'll see those

125
00:03:32,090 --> 00:03:35,289
it this way around you'll see those
there's a parallelogram inside the green

126
00:03:35,289 --> 00:03:35,299
there's a parallelogram inside the green

127
00:03:35,299 --> 00:03:37,509
there's a parallelogram inside the green
one is just a mask and then there's a

128
00:03:37,509 --> 00:03:37,519
one is just a mask and then there's a

129
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:40,089
one is just a mask and then there's a
parallelogram inside with the moving

130
00:03:40,089 --> 00:03:40,099
parallelogram inside with the moving

131
00:03:40,099 --> 00:03:42,069
parallelogram inside with the moving
arms stuck to it rather than seeing the

132
00:03:42,069 --> 00:03:42,079
arms stuck to it rather than seeing the

133
00:03:42,079 --> 00:03:43,930
arms stuck to it rather than seeing the
whole mechanism and how it works you

134
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:43,940
whole mechanism and how it works you

135
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:45,970
whole mechanism and how it works you
just see the image appearing from behind

136
00:03:45,970 --> 00:03:45,980
just see the image appearing from behind

137
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:51,830
just see the image appearing from behind
behind the green mask

138
00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:51,840


139
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,119
so I'll just make one of those just so

140
00:03:54,119 --> 00:03:54,129
so I'll just make one of those just so

141
00:03:54,129 --> 00:03:56,399
so I'll just make one of those just so
you can see how to make it you'll need a

142
00:03:56,399 --> 00:03:56,409
you can see how to make it you'll need a

143
00:03:56,409 --> 00:03:59,599
you can see how to make it you'll need a
base sheet sheet of card fold it in half

144
00:03:59,599 --> 00:03:59,609
base sheet sheet of card fold it in half

145
00:03:59,609 --> 00:04:03,929
base sheet sheet of card fold it in half
crease thoroughly you need a piece to

146
00:04:03,929 --> 00:04:03,939
crease thoroughly you need a piece to

147
00:04:03,939 --> 00:04:06,479
crease thoroughly you need a piece to
make the parallelogram with so just a

148
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:06,489
make the parallelogram with so just a

149
00:04:06,489 --> 00:04:09,119
make the parallelogram with so just a
piece of card something like this fold

150
00:04:09,119 --> 00:04:09,129
piece of card something like this fold

151
00:04:09,129 --> 00:04:13,259
piece of card something like this fold
the tab onto each end of it crease them

152
00:04:13,259 --> 00:04:13,269
the tab onto each end of it crease them

153
00:04:13,269 --> 00:04:20,580
the tab onto each end of it crease them
well we're making a parallelogram here

154
00:04:20,580 --> 00:04:20,590
well we're making a parallelogram here

155
00:04:20,590 --> 00:04:23,360
well we're making a parallelogram here
as explained in tutorial 5 so you just

156
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:23,370
as explained in tutorial 5 so you just

157
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:30,120
as explained in tutorial 5 so you just
fold an extra parallel crease into it so

158
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:30,130
fold an extra parallel crease into it so

159
00:04:30,130 --> 00:04:32,189
fold an extra parallel crease into it so
now what you've ended up with you've got

160
00:04:32,189 --> 00:04:32,199
now what you've ended up with you've got

161
00:04:32,199 --> 00:04:34,770
now what you've ended up with you've got
three parallel creases you've got a long

162
00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:34,780
three parallel creases you've got a long

163
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:38,430
three parallel creases you've got a long
side and the short side so to find out

164
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:38,440
side and the short side so to find out

165
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:43,140
side and the short side so to find out
where you stick this put the piece on

166
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:43,150
where you stick this put the piece on

167
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:49,020
where you stick this put the piece on
the page you just need to mark where one

168
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:49,030
the page you just need to mark where one

169
00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:50,879
the page you just need to mark where one
of the creases lies so I'll just mark

170
00:04:50,879 --> 00:04:50,889
of the creases lies so I'll just mark

171
00:04:50,889 --> 00:04:53,909
of the creases lies so I'll just mark
the the short side bilities and then

172
00:04:53,909 --> 00:04:53,919
the the short side bilities and then

173
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:56,250
the the short side bilities and then
you're going to flip this over flip it

174
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:56,260
you're going to flip this over flip it

175
00:04:56,260 --> 00:04:59,279
you're going to flip this over flip it
over and stick the long side to the mark

176
00:04:59,279 --> 00:04:59,289
over and stick the long side to the mark

177
00:04:59,289 --> 00:05:01,379
over and stick the long side to the mark
this will be giving you your basic

178
00:05:01,379 --> 00:05:01,389
this will be giving you your basic

179
00:05:01,389 --> 00:05:03,510
this will be giving you your basic
parallelogram but before we do that

180
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:03,520
parallelogram but before we do that

181
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:05,520
parallelogram but before we do that
you've got one more set of creases to

182
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:05,530
you've got one more set of creases to

183
00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:08,730
you've got one more set of creases to
make the two small triangles so here's

184
00:05:08,730 --> 00:05:08,740
make the two small triangles so here's

185
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:11,640
make the two small triangles so here's
your card here's your crease just fold

186
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:11,650
your card here's your crease just fold

187
00:05:11,650 --> 00:05:15,300
your card here's your crease just fold
the top edge down so it's it's flush

188
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:15,310
the top edge down so it's it's flush

189
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:19,439
the top edge down so it's it's flush
with that with that crease so it's flush

190
00:05:19,439 --> 00:05:19,449
with that with that crease so it's flush

191
00:05:19,449 --> 00:05:21,839
with that with that crease so it's flush
with that crease there and fold it back

192
00:05:21,839 --> 00:05:21,849
with that crease there and fold it back

193
00:05:21,849 --> 00:05:26,249
with that crease there and fold it back
on itself and yeah just push it in just

194
00:05:26,249 --> 00:05:26,259
on itself and yeah just push it in just

195
00:05:26,259 --> 00:05:29,570
on itself and yeah just push it in just
to make sure it's all working well so

196
00:05:29,570 --> 00:05:29,580
to make sure it's all working well so

197
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:34,700
to make sure it's all working well so
fold it back again so there is so now

198
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:34,710
fold it back again so there is so now

199
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:36,990
fold it back again so there is so now
making sure that the two little

200
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:37,000
making sure that the two little

201
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,510
making sure that the two little
triangles are on the top this is stuck

202
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:39,520
triangles are on the top this is stuck

203
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:42,029
triangles are on the top this is stuck
near the bottom of your page glue the

204
00:05:42,029 --> 00:05:42,039
near the bottom of your page glue the

205
00:05:42,039 --> 00:05:44,610
near the bottom of your page glue the
long side to the mark you made for the

206
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:44,620
long side to the mark you made for the

207
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:50,159
long side to the mark you made for the
shorter side so when the page is flat

208
00:05:50,159 --> 00:05:50,169
shorter side so when the page is flat

209
00:05:50,169 --> 00:05:52,560
shorter side so when the page is flat
the parallelogram lies flat so you can

210
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:52,570
the parallelogram lies flat so you can

211
00:05:52,570 --> 00:05:57,680
the parallelogram lies flat so you can
glue both tabs at the same time so

212
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:57,690
glue both tabs at the same time so

213
00:05:57,690 --> 00:06:05,200
glue both tabs at the same time so
there's the glue

214
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:05,210


215
00:06:05,210 --> 00:06:08,779
right so stick that down with the crease

216
00:06:08,779 --> 00:06:08,789
right so stick that down with the crease

217
00:06:08,789 --> 00:06:14,629
right so stick that down with the crease
to the mark do this one down so that the

218
00:06:14,629 --> 00:06:14,639
to the mark do this one down so that the

219
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:17,210
to the mark do this one down so that the
whole thing is flat all the creases

220
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:17,220
whole thing is flat all the creases

221
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:21,379
whole thing is flat all the creases
should be parallel with the spine fold

222
00:06:21,379 --> 00:06:21,389
should be parallel with the spine fold

223
00:06:21,389 --> 00:06:24,020
should be parallel with the spine fold
it shut make sure that comes forward

224
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:24,030
it shut make sure that comes forward

225
00:06:24,030 --> 00:06:28,580
it shut make sure that comes forward
make sure it's all working nicely now

226
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:28,590
make sure it's all working nicely now

227
00:06:28,590 --> 00:06:36,409
make sure it's all working nicely now
you can pop these back in so that's the

228
00:06:36,409 --> 00:06:36,419
you can pop these back in so that's the

229
00:06:36,419 --> 00:06:38,779
you can pop these back in so that's the
basic underlying mechanism the

230
00:06:38,779 --> 00:06:38,789
basic underlying mechanism the

231
00:06:38,789 --> 00:06:41,240
basic underlying mechanism the
parallelogram with two small small

232
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:41,250
parallelogram with two small small

233
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:43,219
parallelogram with two small small
triangles added and then you make the

234
00:06:43,219 --> 00:06:43,229
triangles added and then you make the

235
00:06:43,229 --> 00:06:46,820
triangles added and then you make the
moving arms so this is going to fit on

236
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:46,830
moving arms so this is going to fit on

237
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:48,770
moving arms so this is going to fit on
to the short side so it's going to fit

238
00:06:48,770 --> 00:06:48,780
to the short side so it's going to fit

239
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:51,740
to the short side so it's going to fit
on to that triangle you can just trim

240
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:51,750
on to that triangle you can just trim

241
00:06:51,750 --> 00:07:00,550
on to that triangle you can just trim
that off there put a bit of glue on it

242
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:00,560


243
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:04,850
right that glues in there probably the

244
00:07:04,850 --> 00:07:04,860
right that glues in there probably the

245
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:07,040
right that glues in there probably the
piece I've got here is too long as it

246
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:07,050
piece I've got here is too long as it

247
00:07:07,050 --> 00:07:09,469
piece I've got here is too long as it
closes is going to crunch against the

248
00:07:09,469 --> 00:07:09,479
closes is going to crunch against the

249
00:07:09,479 --> 00:07:17,689
closes is going to crunch against the
spine so I'll just trim a piece off so

250
00:07:17,689 --> 00:07:17,699
spine so I'll just trim a piece off so

251
00:07:17,699 --> 00:07:20,839
spine so I'll just trim a piece off so
if that fits okay but that's now fitting

252
00:07:20,839 --> 00:07:20,849
if that fits okay but that's now fitting

253
00:07:20,849 --> 00:07:24,409
if that fits okay but that's now fitting
nicely within the parameters if you want

254
00:07:24,409 --> 00:07:24,419
nicely within the parameters if you want

255
00:07:24,419 --> 00:07:27,560
nicely within the parameters if you want
to make it give it that extra elbow you

256
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:27,570
to make it give it that extra elbow you

257
00:07:27,570 --> 00:07:31,300
to make it give it that extra elbow you
can just cut an extra piece off of car

258
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:31,310
can just cut an extra piece off of car

259
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:43,420
can just cut an extra piece off of car
glue that on

260
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:43,430


261
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:46,550
so there we have it the basic moving arm

262
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:46,560
so there we have it the basic moving arm

263
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:53,650
so there we have it the basic moving arm
and that's how it works

264
00:07:53,650 --> 00:07:53,660


265
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:55,909
so now I'll just show you a whole series

266
00:07:55,909 --> 00:07:55,919
so now I'll just show you a whole series

267
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:58,879
so now I'll just show you a whole series
of other other examples in books just

268
00:07:58,879 --> 00:07:58,889
of other other examples in books just

269
00:07:58,889 --> 00:08:01,040
of other other examples in books just
all the variations it's a really useful

270
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:01,050
all the variations it's a really useful

271
00:08:01,050 --> 00:08:05,810
all the variations it's a really useful
mechanism so first we've got this is

272
00:08:05,810 --> 00:08:05,820
mechanism so first we've got this is

273
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:08,000
mechanism so first we've got this is
help the animals of Africa by Roberts

274
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:08,010
help the animals of Africa by Roberts

275
00:08:08,010 --> 00:08:11,210
help the animals of Africa by Roberts
óbuda and so here we are we've got a

276
00:08:11,210 --> 00:08:11,220
óbuda and so here we are we've got a

277
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:13,430

00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:16,080
with the tail stock on it that moves

281
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:18,650
with the tail stock on it that moves
that way and then the body is part of a

282
00:08:18,650 --> 00:08:18,660
that way and then the body is part of a

283
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:20,840
that way and then the body is part of a
parallelogram the moving arm is

284
