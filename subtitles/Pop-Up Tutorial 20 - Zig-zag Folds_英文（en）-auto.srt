3
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:37,700
this tutorial is about zigzag folds

4
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:37,710
this tutorial is about zigzag folds

5
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:41,729
this tutorial is about zigzag folds
here's is self-explanatory it's just

6
00:00:41,729 --> 00:00:41,739
here's is self-explanatory it's just

7
00:00:41,739 --> 00:00:44,729
here's is self-explanatory it's just
four planes two tabs gluing it to the

8
00:00:44,729 --> 00:00:44,739
four planes two tabs gluing it to the

9
00:00:44,739 --> 00:00:48,660
four planes two tabs gluing it to the
page you can vary it somewhat here's

10
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:48,670
page you can vary it somewhat here's

11
00:00:48,670 --> 00:00:51,619
page you can vary it somewhat here's
another example this is based on the

12
00:00:51,619 --> 00:00:51,629
another example this is based on the

13
00:00:51,629 --> 00:00:54,840
another example this is based on the
parallelogram so the important thing is

14
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:54,850
parallelogram so the important thing is

15
00:00:54,850 --> 00:00:57,119
parallelogram so the important thing is
this length on the pop-up is the same as

16
00:00:57,119 --> 00:00:57,129
this length on the pop-up is the same as

17
00:00:57,129 --> 00:00:59,520
this length on the pop-up is the same as
this length on the base this length on

18
00:00:59,520 --> 00:00:59,530
this length on the base this length on

19
00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:01,439
this length on the base this length on
the pop-up is the same as this length on

20
00:01:01,439 --> 00:01:01,449
the pop-up is the same as this length on

21
00:01:01,449 --> 00:01:03,299
the pop-up is the same as this length on
the base where it's glued to the base

22
00:01:03,299 --> 00:01:03,309
the base where it's glued to the base

23
00:01:03,309 --> 00:01:05,850
the base where it's glued to the base
they're angled so they meet at the same

24
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:05,860
they're angled so they meet at the same

25
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:10,050
they're angled so they meet at the same
point on the spine you can also play

26
00:01:10,050 --> 00:01:10,060
point on the spine you can also play

27
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:13,350
point on the spine you can also play
around with it these two types the

28
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:13,360
around with it these two types the

29
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:15,330
around with it these two types the
creases are all vertical but you can

30
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:15,340
creases are all vertical but you can

31
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:17,279
creases are all vertical but you can
actually vary the creases and make them

32
00:01:17,279 --> 00:01:17,289
actually vary the creases and make them

33
00:01:17,289 --> 00:01:19,319
actually vary the creases and make them
lean in or out and that gives you more

34
00:01:19,319 --> 00:01:19,329
lean in or out and that gives you more

35
00:01:19,329 --> 00:01:21,480
lean in or out and that gives you more
interesting sculptural strengths to play

36
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:21,490
interesting sculptural strengths to play

37
00:01:21,490 --> 00:01:25,560
interesting sculptural strengths to play
with so here's one example there's the

38
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:25,570
with so here's one example there's the

39
00:01:25,570 --> 00:01:26,999
with so here's one example there's the
central crease and you've got the two

40
00:01:26,999 --> 00:01:27,009
central crease and you've got the two

41
00:01:27,009 --> 00:01:29,249
central crease and you've got the two
outer ones pointing in towards the

42
00:01:29,249 --> 00:01:29,259
outer ones pointing in towards the

43
00:01:29,259 --> 00:01:34,620
outer ones pointing in towards the
middle and then in this example this is

44
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:34,630
middle and then in this example this is

45
00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:36,300
middle and then in this example this is
the central crease and you've got those

46
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:36,310
the central crease and you've got those

47
00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:38,789
the central crease and you've got those
two creases pointing out but it's still

48
00:01:38,789 --> 00:01:38,799
two creases pointing out but it's still

49
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:41,419
two creases pointing out but it's still
just the two places that it's stuck down

50
00:01:41,419 --> 00:01:41,429
just the two places that it's stuck down

51
00:01:41,429 --> 00:01:44,700
just the two places that it's stuck down
and then when you build these they

52
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:44,710
and then when you build these they

53
00:01:44,710 --> 00:01:46,709
and then when you build these they
create gullies that you can build into

54
00:01:46,709 --> 00:01:46,719
create gullies that you can build into

55
00:01:46,719 --> 00:01:49,319
create gullies that you can build into
so yeah if we just look at well this

56
00:01:49,319 --> 00:01:49,329
so yeah if we just look at well this

57
00:01:49,329 --> 00:01:51,029
so yeah if we just look at well this
you've got you've got these 3 gullies

58
00:01:51,029 --> 00:01:51,039
you've got you've got these 3 gullies

59
00:01:51,039 --> 00:01:54,330
you've got you've got these 3 gullies
you can build into there's the first one

60
00:01:54,330 --> 00:01:54,340
you can build into there's the first one

61
00:01:54,340 --> 00:02:00,149
you can build into there's the first one
I started with this one so here these

62
00:02:00,149 --> 00:02:00,159
I started with this one so here these

63
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:01,380
I started with this one so here these
are the two gullies that you would

64
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:01,390
are the two gullies that you would

65
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:03,359
are the two gullies that you would
normally build into there is one here

66
00:02:03,359 --> 00:02:03,369
normally build into there is one here

67
00:02:03,369 --> 00:02:07,200
normally build into there is one here
and so here's an example this is the

68
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:07,210
and so here's an example this is the

69
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:10,080
and so here's an example this is the
basic zigzag fold with these houses

70
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:10,090
basic zigzag fold with these houses

71
00:02:10,090 --> 00:02:11,100
basic zigzag fold with these houses
built into the gun

72
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:11,110
built into the gun

73
00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:14,490
built into the gun
if I fold it shut you can see how it's

74
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:14,500
if I fold it shut you can see how it's

75
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:16,290
if I fold it shut you can see how it's
being glued down underneath and the

76
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:16,300
being glued down underneath and the

77
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:19,700
being glued down underneath and the
houses are based on on parallelograms

78
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:19,710
houses are based on on parallelograms

79
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:22,440
houses are based on on parallelograms
and yes I've only got one commercial

80
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:22,450
and yes I've only got one commercial

81
00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:25,100
and yes I've only got one commercial
example this is the fairytale village

82
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:25,110
example this is the fairytale village

83
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:30,060
example this is the fairytale village
bilats low back and here it is you've

84
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:30,070
bilats low back and here it is you've

85
00:02:30,070 --> 00:02:33,120
bilats low back and here it is you've
got a zigzag fold and the houses are

86
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:33,130
got a zigzag fold and the houses are

87
00:02:33,130 --> 00:02:35,580
got a zigzag fold and the houses are
built based on parallelograms built into

88
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:35,590
built based on parallelograms built into

89
00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:36,930
built based on parallelograms built into
those gullies and you've got another

90
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:36,940
those gullies and you've got another

91
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:42,180
those gullies and you've got another
zigzag fold there and then these zigzag

92
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:42,190
zigzag fold there and then these zigzag

93
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:44,640
zigzag fold there and then these zigzag
shapes that explained more fully in my

94
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:44,650
shapes that explained more fully in my

95
00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:50,140
shapes that explained more fully in my
book pop-up designer paper mechanics
