this u-turns about pyramids so here it
这个关于金字塔的掉头，所以在这里

2
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:37,480
this u-turns about pyramids so here it
是一个基本的金字塔，你可以改变

3
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:40,290
this u-turns about pyramids so here it
is a basic pyramids you can vary the
比例和改变类型

4
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:40,300
is a basic pyramids you can vary the
您正在生产的金字塔，所以这是

5
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:42,209
is a basic pyramids you can vary the
proportions and change the type of
最简单的是一个例子

6
00:00:42,209 --> 00:00:42,219
proportions and change the type of
那是更深的容忍度

7
00:00:42,219 --> 00:00:44,279
proportions and change the type of
pyramid that you're producing so this is
平行于脊椎而下垂

8
00:00:44,279 --> 00:00:44,289
pyramid that you're producing so this is
这些是基于默认的，所以这些

9
00:00:44,289 --> 00:00:47,729
pyramid that you're producing so this is
the most simple here's an example of one
折痕在脊柱上收敛

10
00:00:47,729 --> 00:00:47,739
the most simple here's an example of one
这次关上拐角处提起

11
00:00:47,739 --> 00:00:53,009
the most simple here's an example of one
that's tolerance deeper this one is
平行于脊椎被卡住

12
00:00:53,009 --> 00:00:53,019
that's tolerance deeper this one is
它也以不同的方式关闭

13
00:00:53,019 --> 00:00:55,250
that's tolerance deeper this one is
stuck down parallel to the spine whereas
这有六个折痕，而另一个

14
00:00:55,250 --> 00:00:55,260
stuck down parallel to the spine whereas
只是在角落的折痕

15
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:59,250
stuck down parallel to the spine whereas
these ones are based on default so these
金字塔，这个必须有折痕

16
00:00:59,250 --> 00:00:59,260
these ones are based on default so these
脊柱上方还有其他

17
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:02,549
these ones are based on default so these
the creases converge on the spine as it
变化，所以这是一个

18
00:01:02,549 --> 00:01:02,559
the creases converge on the spine as it
不对称的金字塔非常复杂

19
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:06,990
the creases converge on the spine as it
closes down the corner lift up this time
计算，但它们相当有趣

20
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:07,000
closes down the corner lift up this time
这是另一个变化

21
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,240
closes down the corner lift up this time
is stuck down parallel to the spine so
实际上是一个圆锥体，但是是一样的

22
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:09,250
is stuck down parallel to the spine so
作为金字塔的原理

23
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:11,880
is stuck down parallel to the spine so
it closes up in a different way also
平行于脊椎卡住

24
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:11,890
it closes up in a different way also
没有任何角度折痕

25
00:01:11,890 --> 00:01:14,429
it closes up in a different way also
this has six creases whereas the other
角，但基本形状相同

26
00:01:14,429 --> 00:01:14,439
this has six creases whereas the other
这是一个伸展的金字塔，这是一个

27
00:01:14,439 --> 00:01:16,319
this has six creases whereas the other
just has creases on the corners of the

above the spine there are other
教程艾滋病等等

33
00:01:20,770 --> 00:01:25,020
above the spine there are other
variations so there's and this is an
基本的金字塔已经城堡

34
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:25,030
variations so there's and this is an
给骆驼很僵硬

35
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:27,510
variations so there's and this is an

形状，以便您可以切掉，所以我会

36
00:01:27,510 --> 00:01:27,520
asymmetric pyramids quite complicated to
只是告诉你如何使自己变得规律

37
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:32,480
asymmetric pyramids quite complicated to
calculate but they're quite quite fun
简单的金字塔取一个基片折叠

38
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:32,490

将其完全折半

39
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:35,999

this is a another variation this is
那你可以拿半张卡

40
00:01:35,999 --> 00:01:36,009
this is a another variation this is
你需要一个指南针，你需要一个计分

41
00:01:36,009 --> 00:01:38,310
this is a another variation this is
actually a cone but it's the same
用一把尺子和通常的剪刀

越恭喜你，金字塔可以成为你

46
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:42,670
stuck down parallel to the spine just
然后调整之间的差距

47
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:45,270
stuck down parallel to the spine just
hasn't got any angle creases making
点和指南针上的铅笔

48
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:45,280
hasn't got any angle creases making
间隙越大，金字塔越平坦

49
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:50,219
hasn't got any angle creases making
corners but it's the same basic shape so
差距越小，越多

50
00:01:50,219 --> 00:01:50,229
corners but it's the same basic shape so
如此陡峭而尖锐

51
00:01:50,229 --> 00:01:52,889
corners but it's the same basic shape so
this is a stretch pyramid it's a
取决于你想要什么类型的金字塔

52
00:01:52,889 --> 00:01:52,899
this is a stretch pyramid it's a
所以做第一个标记并测量一个

53
00:01:52,899 --> 00:01:55,649
this is a stretch pyramid it's a
parallel fold tutorial six with half a
让我们再来一次艺术再做一次，这些

54
