这是关于如何制作狮子卡

3
00:00:34,199 --> 00:00:37,020
this is about how to make a lion card
这对生日很好，所以这

4
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:37,030
this is about how to make a lion card
是基于的生日狮子卡

5
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:39,059
this is about how to make a lion card
which is very good for birthdays so this
弯曲的形状，这是我教程13

6
00:00:39,059 --> 00:00:39,069
which is very good for birthdays so this
这里有一些预切的东西

7
00:00:39,069 --> 00:00:41,819
which is very good for birthdays so this
is a birthday lion card it's based on
他们的尺寸使一个

8
00:00:41,819 --> 00:00:41,829
is a birthday lion card it's based on
完全像这样，您实际上可以做到

9
00:00:41,829 --> 00:00:44,939
is a birthday lion card it's based on
curved shapes which is tutorial 13 I've
通过眼睛，在这种情况下，您可能会得到

10
00:00:44,939 --> 00:00:44,949
curved shapes which is tutorial 13 I've
您可能想要的形状略有不同

11
00:00:44,949 --> 00:00:47,939
curved shapes which is tutorial 13 I've
got some pre-cut pieces here with all
玩，但如果你想

12
00:00:47,939 --> 00:00:47,949
got some pre-cut pieces here with all
就是这样一个是上颚

13
00:00:47,949 --> 00:00:50,219
got some pre-cut pieces here with all
the dimensions on them to make one
这是下颚，所以

14
00:00:50,219 --> 00:00:50,229
the dimensions on them to make one
尺寸是这里的长度

15
00:00:50,229 --> 00:00:53,849
the dimensions on them to make one
exactly like this you can actually do it
沿这是八，所以这是

16
00:00:53,849 --> 00:00:53,859
exactly like this you can actually do it
这个长度八厘米，这里八

17
00:00:53,859 --> 00:00:55,619
exactly like this you can actually do it
by eye in which case you might get
厘米，然后你来到这里

18
00:00:55,619 --> 00:00:55,629
by eye in which case you might get
这是六厘米，然后是

19
00:00:55,629 --> 00:00:57,239
by eye in which case you might get
slightly different shapes you might want
另外六厘米，你需要三个

20
00:00:57,239 --> 00:00:57,249
slightly different shapes you might want
选项卡两个一个去这里，一个去这里

21
00:00:57,249 --> 00:00:58,709
slightly different shapes you might want
to play around with it but if you want
它将粘贴到页面上，然后

22
00:00:58,709 --> 00:00:58,719
to play around with it but if you want
这个是拉动整体的一个

23
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:03,180
to play around with it but if you want
one just like this this is the top jaw
形状变成卡片

24
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:03,190
one just like this this is the top jaw
调整角度

25
00:01:03,190 --> 00:01:06,420
one just like this this is the top jaw
and this is the bottom jaw and so the
页面和这个中央折痕是

26
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:06,430
and this is the bottom jaw and so the
您所到之处的角度为65度

27
00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:10,080
and this is the bottom jaw and so the
dimensions are the length along here
围绕曲线折叠

28
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:10,090
dimensions are the length along here
鼻子的弯曲是一百

29
00:01:10,090 --> 00:01:13,080
dimensions are the length along here
along here this is eight so this is
三十度的制作方法

30
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:13,090
along here this is eight so this is
就是这样折成两半

31
00:01:13,090 --> 00:01:15,420
along here this is eight so this is
eight centimeters this length here eight
然后您可以测量这130和

32
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:15,430
eight centimeters this length here eight
那么你只剪掉一侧

33
00:01:15,430 --> 00:01:17,969
eight centimeters this length here eight
centimeters and then you come up here
在另一边留下标签

34
00:01:17,969 --> 00:01:17,979
centimeters and then you come up here
在教程中解释了十三弯

35
00:01:17,979 --> 00:01:20,849
centimeters and then you come up here
this is six centimeters and then this is
形状这是下颚，所以这

36
00:01:20,849 --> 00:01:20,859
this is six centimeters and then this is
实际上会像这样坚持

37
00:01:20,859 --> 00:01:23,459
this is six centimeters and then this is
another six centimeters you need three
这种情况下沿着底部的长度

38
00:01:23,459 --> 00:01:23,469
another six centimeters you need three
下巴贴在这里

39
00:01:23,469 --> 00:01:26,310
another six centimeters you need three
tabs two one goes here and one goes here
佩奇是9厘米，这有点

40
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:26,320
tabs two one goes here and one goes here
它出现在这里的是6

41
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:28,410
tabs two one goes here and one goes here
which will stick it to the page and then
厘米

42
00:01:28,410 --> 00:01:28,420
which will stick it to the page and then
这实际上是一个锐角v-fold

43
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:30,359
which will stick it to the page and then
this one is the one that pulls the whole
这是教程2，这是基础

44
00:01:30,359 --> 00:01:30,369
this one is the one that pulls the whole
从您所在的位置下降

45
00:01:30,369 --> 00:01:32,399
this one is the one that pulls the whole
thing into shape to make it into a card
会黏住5个上颚

46
00:01:32,399 --> 00:01:32,409
thing into shape to make it into a card
厘米从

47
00:01:32,409 --> 00:01:36,569
thing into shape to make it into a card
shape the angles the angles here between
底部，你要坚持这个

48
00:01:36,569 --> 00:01:36,579
shape the angles the angles here between
一下来就是一个半

49
00:01:36,579 --> 00:01:39,810
shape the angles the angles here between
the page and this central crease that is
厘米，然后是所有角度

50
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:39,820
the page and this central crease that is
你把它放下和中央

51
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:43,800
the page and this central crease that is
65 degrees the angle here where you go
脊柱都是35度，所以我

52
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:43,810
65 degrees the angle here where you go
只需将其粘贴到此处，即可

53
00:01:43,810 --> 00:01:45,510
65 degrees the angle here where you go
around the curve the fold goes around
只是看看它的样子，因为

54
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:45,520
around the curve the fold goes around
我测量过，你实际上可以坚持所有

55
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:47,760
around the curve the fold goes around
the curve of the nose that's a hundred
我会同时贴标签

56
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:47,770
the curve of the nose that's a hundred
丹通常伸出来，我们坚持下来

57
00:01:47,770 --> 00:01:50,550
the curve of the nose that's a hundred
and thirty degrees so well way of making
一侧折叠将其关闭，将胶水粘在

58
00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:50,560
and thirty degrees so well way of making
另一边折叠整个底座

59
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,349
and thirty degrees so well way of making
it is you just fold it in half like this
封闭，所以他们找到了自己的自然地方

60
00:01:52,349 --> 00:01:52,359
it is you just fold it in half like this
但在这种情况下，因为这就是全部

61
00:01:52,359 --> 00:01:55,080
it is you just fold it in half like this
and then you can measure this 130 and
测量我们可以将两面都朝下

62
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:55,090
and then you can measure this 130 and
同一时间

63
00:01:55,090 --> 00:01:57,630
and then you can measure this 130 and
then you've just cut out one side and
那是第一个，只是为了

64
00:01:57,630 --> 00:01:57,640
then you've just cut out one side and
确定听起来我们会关闭它

65
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:59,819
then you've just cut out one side and
leave a tab on the other side it's all
如果我的测量值有点狡猾，是的

66
00:01:59,819 --> 00:01:59,829
leave a tab on the other side it's all
所以那是下颚上颚

67
00:01:59,829 --> 00:02:02,609
leave a tab on the other side it's all
explained in tutorials thirteen curved
首先将其粘上，这样您就可以

68
00:02:02,609 --> 00:02:02,619
explained in tutorials thirteen curved
圆角的形状，所以我们只需在上面涂胶

69
00:02:02,619 --> 00:02:06,389
explained in tutorials thirteen curved
shapes this is the bottom jaw so this
轻轻地将胶水涂抹到

70
00:02:06,389 --> 00:02:06,399
shapes this is the bottom jaw so this
折痕很重要

71
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:09,420
shapes this is the bottom jaw so this
will actually stick on like this and in
粘贴时将其折叠关闭

72
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:09,430
will actually stick on like this and in
应该完全能够

73
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:11,880
will actually stick on like this and in
this case the length along the bottom
平，所以我们可以再坚持一次

74
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:11,890
this case the length along the bottom
这些行，我们可以在两个标签上粘贴

75
00:02:11,890 --> 00:02:13,610
this case the length along the bottom
jaw here where it sticks
同时我会把它转过来

76
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:13,620
jaw here where it sticks
所以我实际上可以从

77
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:16,850
jaw here where it sticks
Paige that's 9 centimeters and this bit
里面，所以再次在这两个上面放胶

78
00:02:16,850 --> 00:02:16,860
Paige that's 9 centimeters and this bit
直到折痕是

79
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:19,130
Paige that's 9 centimeters and this bit
where it comes up here that's 6
重要的事情如此卡住

我将尺寸留在了

84
00:02:22,339 --> 00:02:22,349
this is actually an acute angle v-fold
在这种情况下在外面，但通常这样做

85
00:02:22,349 --> 00:02:27,320
this is actually an acute angle v-fold
that's tutorial 2 here's the base so
用铅笔擦掉或粘

86
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:27,330
