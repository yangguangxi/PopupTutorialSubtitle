folds

15
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:52,709
folds
counter folds were covered in the

16
00:00:52,709 --> 00:00:52,719
counter folds were covered in the

17
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:54,689
counter folds were covered in the
introduction but just very briefly and

18
00:00:54,689 --> 00:00:54,699
introduction but just very briefly and

19
00:00:54,699 --> 00:00:56,759

so I'll just recap some of that and then

21
00:00:56,769 --> 00:00:58,919
so I'll just recap some of that and then
show you how you can use those to

22
00:00:58,919 --> 00:00:58,929
show you how you can use those to

23
00:00:58,929 --> 00:01:05,249
show you how you can use those to
enhance your pop-up spreads there are

24
00:01:05,249 --> 00:01:05,259

fold it in half and then make a single

28
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:11,500
fold it in half and then make a single

29
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:15,719
fold it in half and then make a single
cut so with one cut and one crease fold

30
00:01:15,719 --> 00:01:15,729
cut so with one cut and one crease fold

31
00:01:15,729 --> 00:01:21,359

it like this fold it back on itself open

32
00:01:21,359 --> 00:01:21,369
it like this fold it back on itself open

33
00:01:21,369 --> 00:01:26,219
it like this fold it back on itself open
it up and push it forward so this is the

34
00:01:26,219 --> 00:01:26,229
it up and push it forward so this is the

35
00:01:26,229 --> 00:01:31,740
it up and push it forward so this is the
most simple basic pop-up the most simple

36
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:31,750
most simple basic pop-up the most simple

37
00:01:31,750 --> 00:01:33,960

counter fold so there's one you can do

38
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:33,970
counter fold so there's one you can do

39
00:01:33,970 --> 00:01:36,990
counter fold so there's one you can do
the same below the cut if you want you

40
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:37,000
the same below the cut if you want you

41
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,580
the same below the cut if you want you
could change the angle that you're

42
00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:38,590
could change the angle that you're

43
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:40,200
could change the angle that you're
coming in at and so then you get a

44
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:40,210
coming in at and so then you get a

45
00:01:40,210 --> 00:01:45,660
coming in at and so then you get a
different shaped 3d piece so open that

46
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:45,670
different shaped 3d piece so open that

47
00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:49,889
different shaped 3d piece so open that
up so you can see by changing the angle

48
00:01:49,889 --> 00:01:49,899
up so you can see by changing the angle

49
00:01:49,899 --> 00:01:51,420
up so you can see by changing the angle
that you've creased it out you can get

50
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:51,430
that you've creased it out you can get

51
00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:53,819
that you've creased it out you can get
get two different shapes you can also

52
00:01:53,819 --> 00:01:53,829
get two different shapes you can also

53
00:01:53,829 --> 00:01:55,200
get two different shapes you can also
just add it to the tip you don't

54
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:55,210
just add it to the tip you don't

55
00:01:55,210 --> 00:01:57,179
just add it to the tip you don't
necessarily need the cut you can work

56
00:01:57,179 --> 00:01:57,189
necessarily need the cut you can work

57
00:01:57,189 --> 00:01:59,100
necessarily need the cut you can work
from the edge so say at the top here

58
00:01:59,100 --> 00:01:59,110
from the edge so say at the top here

59
00:01:59,110 --> 00:02:03,060

fold it in half add in another fold so

60
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:03,070
fold it in half add in another fold so

61
00:02:03,070 --> 00:02:08,060
fold it in half add in another fold so
it's like this fold it back on itself

62
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:08,070


63
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:12,000
open it up and pop that forward so

64
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:12,010
open it up and pop that forward so

65
00:02:12,010 --> 00:02:14,260
open it up and pop that forward so
they've got the different options this

66
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:14,270
they've got the different options this

67
00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:17,530
they've got the different options this
is all based on befalls the second kind

68
00:02:17,530 --> 00:02:17,540
is all based on befalls the second kind

69
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:21,550
is all based on befalls the second kind
uses two cuts and one crease so we'll

70
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:21,560
uses two cuts and one crease so we'll

71
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:24,550
uses two cuts and one crease so we'll
make two cuts about the same length you

72
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:24,560
make two cuts about the same length you

73
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,470
make two cuts about the same length you
don't even need to cut them they can be

74
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:26,480
don't even need to cut them they can be

75
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:29,170
don't even need to cut them they can be
torn they don't even need to be parallel

76
00:02:29,170 --> 00:02:29,180
torn they don't even need to be parallel

77
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:31,450
torn they don't even need to be parallel
they can be at any angle it'll still

78
00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:31,460
they can be at any angle it'll still

79
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:34,590
they can be at any angle it'll still
work in this case you fold it like this

80
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:34,600
work in this case you fold it like this

81
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:38,590
work in this case you fold it like this
fold it back on itself and when you pop

82
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:38,600
fold it back on itself and when you pop

83
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:42,550
fold it back on itself and when you pop
that one forward you you've got a type

84
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:42,560
that one forward you you've got a type

85
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:45,490
that one forward you you've got a type
of step so that's the second time this

86
00:02:45,490 --> 00:02:45,500
of step so that's the second time this

87
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:49,170
of step so that's the second time this
is about parallel creases the third kind

88
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:49,180
is about parallel creases the third kind

89
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:54,730
is about parallel creases the third kind
is one short cut and one long one so

90
00:02:54,730 --> 00:02:54,740
is one short cut and one long one so

91
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:58,540
is one short cut and one long one so
this is actually the it's the converging

92
00:02:58,540 --> 00:02:58,550
this is actually the it's the converging

93
00:02:58,550 --> 00:03:01,210
this is actually the it's the converging
crease mechanism but it's a variation so

94
00:03:01,210 --> 00:03:01,220
crease mechanism but it's a variation so

95
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:04,060
crease mechanism but it's a variation so
again you fold it from the ends of the

96
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:04,070
again you fold it from the ends of the

97
00:03:04,070 --> 00:03:06,430
again you fold it from the ends of the
cuts the fold goes from end of cut to

98
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:06,440
cuts the fold goes from end of cut to

99
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:11,110
cuts the fold goes from end of cut to
end of cut fold it back on itself open

100
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:11,120
end of cut fold it back on itself open

101
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:16,750
end of cut fold it back on itself open
it up pop it forward so this is giving

102
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:16,760
it up pop it forward so this is giving

103
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:20,890
it up pop it forward so this is giving
you an angled to more angled planes to

104
00:03:20,890 --> 00:03:20,900
you an angled to more angled planes to

105
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:24,490
you an angled to more angled planes to
build with these shapes they create

106
00:03:24,490 --> 00:03:24,500
build with these shapes they create

107
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:27,130
build with these shapes they create
creases Valley folds and they create

108
00:03:27,130 --> 00:03:27,140
creases Valley folds and they create

109
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:28,840
creases Valley folds and they create
mountain folds and any of those can be

110
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:28,850
mountain folds and any of those can be

111
00:03:28,850 --> 00:03:30,930
mountain folds and any of those can be
worked on so if you take this one you

112
00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:30,940
worked on so if you take this one you

113
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:34,270
worked on so if you take this one you
can actually make an extra cut into it

114
00:03:34,270 --> 00:03:34,280
can actually make an extra cut into it

115
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:39,550
can actually make an extra cut into it
and you can fold that and then as you

116
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:39,560
and you can fold that and then as you

117
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:44,680
and you can fold that and then as you
open that up you find you've got the

118
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:44,690
open that up you find you've got the

119
00:03:44,690 --> 00:03:46,990
open that up you find you've got the
main counter fold and then you've got

120
00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:47,000
main counter fold and then you've got

121
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,660
main counter fold and then you've got
another small one added to it you can do

122
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:49,670
another small one added to it you can do

123
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:51,700
another small one added to it you can do
this with any of them so say we take

124
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:51,710
this with any of them so say we take

125
00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:55,240
this with any of them so say we take
this this step one here you can add a

126
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:55,250
this this step one here you can add a

127
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:58,000
this this step one here you can add a
cut to the main step give it a couple of

128
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:58,010
cut to the main step give it a couple of

129
00:03:58,010 --> 00:04:02,770
cut to the main step give it a couple of
creases so you've got a small extra step

130
00:04:02,770 --> 00:04:02,780
creases so you've got a small extra step

131
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:08,140
creases so you've got a small extra step
added in there like that you can also

132
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:08,150
added in there like that you can also

133
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:11,620
added in there like that you can also
work into one of these edges we could

134
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:11,630
work into one of these edges we could

135
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:14,590
work into one of these edges we could
try that with a short short cut and a

136
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:14,600
try that with a short short cut and a

137
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:22,990
try that with a short short cut and a
longer one so when you bend that

138
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:23,000


139
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,820

00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:03,100
Bruce Foster and so the examples I've
got a quite small but this is a v-fold

166
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:03,110
got a quite small but this is a v-fold

167
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:05,570
got a quite small but this is a v-fold
this is the counter fold that's been

168
00:05:05,570 --> 00:05:05,580
this is the counter fold that's been

169
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:08,839
this is the counter fold that's been
built into it here and that counter fold

170
00:05:08,839 --> 00:05:08,849
built into it here and that counter fold

171
00:05:08,849 --> 00:05:10,850
built into it here and that counter fold
one of the planes of it is being used to

172
00:05:10,850 --> 00:05:10,860
one of the planes of it is being used to

173
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:14,089
one of the planes of it is being used to
lift up this extra piece then here as

174
00:05:14,089 --> 00:05:14,099
lift up this extra piece then here as

175
00:05:14,099 --> 00:05:15,860
lift up this extra piece then here as
well it's again it's rather small we've

176
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:15,870
well it's again it's rather small we've

177
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:19,129
well it's again it's rather small we've
got a a V fold with a counter fold built

178
00:05:19,129 --> 00:05:19,139
got a a V fold with a counter fold built

179
00:05:19,139 --> 00:05:21,050
got a a V fold with a counter fold built
into it and that's been used to lift up

180
00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:21,060
into it and that's been used to lift up

181
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:25,339
into it and that's been used to lift up
this plane this is cookie count by

182
00:05:25,339 --> 00:05:25,349
this plane this is cookie count by

183
00:05:25,349 --> 00:05:29,180
this plane this is cookie count by
Roberts óbuda and in this example here

184
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:29,190
Roberts óbuda and in this example here

185
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:33,110
Roberts óbuda and in this example here
we've got this is a parallel fold here's

186
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:33,120
we've got this is a parallel fold here's

187
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,450
we've got this is a parallel fold here's
the counter fold built into it here and

188
00:05:35,450 --> 00:05:35,460
the counter fold built into it here and

189
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:38,420
the counter fold built into it here and
then this is sticking out raising an

190
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:38,430
then this is sticking out raising an

191
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:41,300
then this is sticking out raising an
image so the image is built on to the

192
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:41,310
image so the image is built on to the

193
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:44,510
image so the image is built on to the
main mechanism and the last one I want

194
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:44,520
main mechanism and the last one I want

195
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:48,290
main mechanism and the last one I want
to show you is the pop-up Frankenstein

196
00:05:48,290 --> 00:05:48,300
to show you is the pop-up Frankenstein

197
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:51,200
to show you is the pop-up Frankenstein

this one here the tab that is holding

200
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:57,330
this one here the tab that is holding

201
00:05:57,330 --> 00:06:00,110
this one here the tab that is holding
the whole mechanism to the page rather

202
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:00,120
the whole mechanism to the page rather

203
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,820
the whole mechanism to the page rather
than going backwards out of sight it's

204
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:01,830
than going backwards out of sight it's

205
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:03,980
than going backwards out of sight it's
coming forward and so this is the

206
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:03,990
coming forward and so this is the

207
00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:06,950
coming forward and so this is the
counter fold cut into it here raising

208
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:06,960
counter fold cut into it here raising

209
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:09,110
counter fold cut into it here raising
this image if you look at it from behind

210
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:09,120
this image if you look at it from behind

211
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:11,570
this image if you look at it from behind
you can see this is the counter folders

212
00:06:11,570 --> 00:06:11,580
you can see this is the counter folders

213
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:13,310
you can see this is the counter folders
being cut into this there's a cut there

214
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:13,320
being cut into this there's a cut there

215
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:15,290
being cut into this there's a cut there
and that piece is being pushed forward

216
00:06:15,290 --> 00:06:15,300
and that piece is being pushed forward

217
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:17,510
and that piece is being pushed forward
it looks as though there's actually a

218
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:17,520
it looks as though there's actually a

219
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,850
it looks as though there's actually a
second one here so looking at it like

220
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:19,860
second one here so looking at it like

221
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:22,610
second one here so looking at it like
this you can see there's a counter fold

222
00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:22,620
this you can see there's a counter fold

223
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:24,950
this you can see there's a counter fold
there raising this image there's another

224
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:24,960
there raising this image there's another

225
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:28,700
there raising this image there's another
one there raising this image so that's

226
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:28,710
one there raising this image so that's

227
00:06:28,710 --> 00:06:30,140
one there raising this image so that's
quite a nicely science done

228
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:30,150
quite a nicely science done

229
00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:32,240
quite a nicely science done
again on on this line as well so there's

230
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:32,250
again on on this line as well so there's

231
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:35,480
again on on this line as well so there's
three of those so I'll just show you

232
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:35,490
three of those so I'll just show you

233
00:06:35,490 --> 00:06:42,080
three of those so I'll just show you
quickly how to do it on a on a v-fold so

234
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:42,090
quickly how to do it on a on a v-fold so

235
00:06:42,090 --> 00:06:45,850
quickly how to do it on a on a v-fold so
if we take a base sheet nicely creased I

236
00:06:45,850 --> 00:06:45,860
if we take a base sheet nicely creased I

237
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:50,960
if we take a base sheet nicely creased I
take a piece of card so this is a basic

238
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:50,970
take a piece of card so this is a basic

239
00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:53,450
take a piece of card so this is a basic
B fold and a cute angle view fold I'm

240
00:06:53,450 --> 00:06:53,460
B fold and a cute angle view fold I'm

241
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:54,080
B fold and a cute angle view fold I'm
making

242
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:54,090
making

243
00:06:54,090 --> 00:06:57,080
making
I'll make the tabs quite big so we can

244
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:57,090
I'll make the tabs quite big so we can

245
00:06:57,090 --> 00:07:00,140
I'll make the tabs quite big so we can
make counter folds in those so we create

246
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:00,150
make counter folds in those so we create

247
00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:02,650
make counter folds in those so we create
it up like this

248
00:07:02,650 --> 00:07:02,660
it up like this

249
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:05,360
it up like this
the crucial thing with these v-folds is

250
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:05,370
the crucial thing with these v-folds is

251
00:07:05,370 --> 00:07:07,130
the crucial thing with these v-folds is
that you you cut away up to the point

252
00:07:07,130 --> 00:07:07,140
that you you cut away up to the point

253
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:12,400
that you you cut away up to the point
where all the creases meet so here it is

254
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:12,410
where all the creases meet so here it is

255
00:07:12,410 --> 00:07:15,740
where all the creases meet so here it is
it's going to stick down I'll just

256
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:15,750
it's going to stick down I'll just

257
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:20,630
it's going to stick down I'll just
reinforce these it it's going to stick

258
00:07:20,630 --> 00:07:20,640
reinforce these it it's going to stick

259
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:23,660
reinforce these it it's going to stick
on to your page like this but in this

260
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:23,670
on to your page like this but in this

261
00:07:23,670 --> 00:07:26,030
on to your page like this but in this
case I'm going to keep the tabs coming

262
00:07:26,030 --> 00:07:26,040
case I'm going to keep the tabs coming

263
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:28,490
case I'm going to keep the tabs coming
forward so we can build counter folds

264
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:28,500
forward so we can build counter folds

265
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:31,040
forward so we can build counter folds
into them so the whole piece is going to

266
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:31,050
into them so the whole piece is going to

267
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:33,860
into them so the whole piece is going to
stick onto your page like that I've just

268
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:33,870
stick onto your page like that I've just

269
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:35,990
stick onto your page like that I've just
reinforce these creases so the whole

270
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:36,000
reinforce these creases so the whole

271
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,420
reinforce these creases so the whole
thing moves nice and sweetly and then

272
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:40,430
thing moves nice and sweetly and then

273
00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:43,310
thing moves nice and sweetly and then
before you glue it down you need to work

274
00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:43,320
before you glue it down you need to work

275
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:45,410
before you glue it down you need to work
out what what can't afford you want this

276
00:07:45,410 --> 00:07:45,420
out what what can't afford you want this

277
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:52,240
out what what can't afford you want this
into it so let's have a step type here

278
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:52,250


279
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:55,850
or an angled step up made the cuts to

280
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:55,860
or an angled step up made the cuts to

281
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:57,620
or an angled step up made the cuts to
different lengths so we're going to have

282
00:07:57,620 --> 00:07:57,630
different lengths so we're going to have

283
00:07:57,630 --> 00:08:02,990
different lengths so we're going to have
an angled step on that side fold it back

284
00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:03,000
an angled step on that side fold it back

285
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,750
an angled step on that side fold it back
on itself and then on on this side we'll

286
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:05,760
on itself and then on on this side we'll

287
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:09,050
on itself and then on on this side we'll
just have a regular step so we make two

288
00:08:09,050 --> 00:08:09,060
just have a regular step so we make two

289
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:16,399
just have a regular step so we make two
cuts both the same length

290
00:08:16,399 --> 00:08:16,409


291
00:08:16,409 --> 00:08:20,219
so when this is all opened up this is

292
00:08:20,219 --> 00:08:20,229
so when this is all opened up this is

293
00:08:20,229 --> 00:08:27,570
so when this is all opened up this is
going to be working like this and we've

294
00:08:27,570 --> 00:08:27,580
going to be working like this and we've

295
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:29,519
going to be working like this and we've
also got this mountain fold in the

296
00:08:29,519 --> 00:08:29,529
also got this mountain fold in the

297
00:08:29,529 --> 00:08:32,490
also got this mountain fold in the
middle so we make a couple of cuts in

298
00:08:32,490 --> 00:08:32,500
middle so we make a couple of cuts in

299
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:37,290
middle so we make a couple of cuts in
that one one cap will probably be fine

300
00:08:37,290 --> 00:08:37,300
that one one cap will probably be fine

301
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:43,889
that one one cap will probably be fine
fold it down so little going like that

302
00:08:43,889 --> 00:08:43,899
fold it down so little going like that

303
00:08:43,899 --> 00:08:47,309
fold it down so little going like that
and let's just add one more on the top

304
00:08:47,309 --> 00:08:47,319
and let's just add one more on the top

305
00:08:47,319 --> 00:08:50,850
and let's just add one more on the top
or just an extra little fold in there so

306
00:08:50,850 --> 00:08:50,860
or just an extra little fold in there so

307
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:52,949
or just an extra little fold in there so
generate a couple more planes that we

308
00:08:52,949 --> 00:08:52,959
generate a couple more planes that we

309
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:57,689
generate a couple more planes that we
can be consuming so here is ready to go

310
00:08:57,689 --> 00:08:57,699
can be consuming so here is ready to go

311
00:08:57,699 --> 00:08:59,910
can be consuming so here is ready to go
now with all these default mechanisms

312
00:08:59,910 --> 00:08:59,920
now with all these default mechanisms

313
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:02,249
now with all these default mechanisms
you can play around with how how close

314
00:09:02,249 --> 00:09:02,259
you can play around with how how close

315
00:09:02,259 --> 00:09:04,050
you can play around with how how close
to the spine you stick know what sort of

316
00:09:04,050 --> 00:09:04,060
to the spine you stick know what sort of

317
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:05,280
to the spine you stick know what sort of
shape you want whether you want it

318
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:05,290
shape you want whether you want it

319
00:09:05,290 --> 00:09:06,930
shape you want whether you want it
really tight or whether you want it

320
00:09:06,930 --> 00:09:06,940
really tight or whether you want it

321
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:09,480
really tight or whether you want it
further out so it lies down more and

322
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:09,490
further out so it lies down more and

323
00:09:09,490 --> 00:09:11,550
further out so it lies down more and
more I'll probably go with sticking it

324
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:11,560
more I'll probably go with sticking it

325
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:13,829
more I'll probably go with sticking it
down at roughly 45 degrees to the spine

326
00:09:13,829 --> 00:09:13,839
down at roughly 45 degrees to the spine

327
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:21,749
down at roughly 45 degrees to the spine
put the glue on one side push the glue

328
00:09:21,749 --> 00:09:21,759
put the glue on one side push the glue

329
00:09:21,759 --> 00:09:23,850
put the glue on one side push the glue
right up to the creases it doesn't

330
00:09:23,850 --> 00:09:23,860
right up to the creases it doesn't

331
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:26,220
right up to the creases it doesn't
really matter about the edges of the

332
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:26,230
really matter about the edges of the

333
00:09:26,230 --> 00:09:30,629
really matter about the edges of the
flaps but makes it neater if you do and

334
00:09:30,629 --> 00:09:30,639
flaps but makes it neater if you do and

335
00:09:30,639 --> 00:09:32,429
flaps but makes it neater if you do and
then this central crease has to be

336
00:09:32,429 --> 00:09:32,439
then this central crease has to be

337
00:09:32,439 --> 00:09:37,740
then this central crease has to be
aligned with the spine so there is and

338
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:37,750
aligned with the spine so there is and

339
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:41,850
aligned with the spine so there is and
then you fold the whole piece shut put

340
00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:41,860
then you fold the whole piece shut put

341
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:48,699
then you fold the whole piece shut put
glue on the other tab

342
00:09:48,699 --> 00:09:48,709


343
00:09:48,709 --> 00:09:51,970
close the base so that finds its natural

344
00:09:51,970 --> 00:09:51,980
close the base so that finds its natural

345
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:55,199
close the base so that finds its natural
sticking position place it down well

346
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:55,209
sticking position place it down well

347
00:09:55,209 --> 00:09:57,939
sticking position place it down well
there's your V folder the whole series

348
00:09:57,939 --> 00:09:57,949
there's your V folder the whole series

349
00:09:57,949 --> 00:10:00,429
there's your V folder the whole series
of counterpoint added to it now you can

350
00:10:00,429 --> 00:10:00,439
of counterpoint added to it now you can

351
00:10:00,439 --> 00:10:03,100
of counterpoint added to it now you can
start building with these you can use

352
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:03,110
start building with these you can use

353
00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:06,369
start building with these you can use
them any way you like really so say this

354
00:10:06,369 --> 00:10:06,379
them any way you like really so say this

355
00:10:06,379 --> 00:10:09,129
them any way you like really so say this
you can come up or you can come forward

356
00:10:09,129 --> 00:10:09,139
you can come up or you can come forward

357
00:10:09,139 --> 00:10:13,090
you can come up or you can come forward
we can or you can do both so just make

358
00:10:13,090 --> 00:10:13,100
we can or you can do both so just make

359
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:19,419
we can or you can do both so just make
one of these going this way and one of

360
00:10:19,419 --> 00:10:19,429
one of these going this way and one of

361
00:10:19,429 --> 00:10:26,049
one of these going this way and one of
them standing up every time you add a

362
00:10:26,049 --> 00:10:26,059
them standing up every time you add a

363
00:10:26,059 --> 00:10:28,509
them standing up every time you add a
piece to a construction always close it

364
00:10:28,509 --> 00:10:28,519
piece to a construction always close it

365
00:10:28,519 --> 00:10:29,769
piece to a construction always close it
down and make sure that it's going to

366
00:10:29,769 --> 00:10:29,779
down and make sure that it's going to

367
00:10:29,779 --> 00:10:31,449
down and make sure that it's going to
work but it's going to fit in that

368
00:10:31,449 --> 00:10:31,459
work but it's going to fit in that

369
00:10:31,459 --> 00:10:33,549
work but it's going to fit in that
pieces aren't jamming together or

370
00:10:33,549 --> 00:10:33,559
pieces aren't jamming together or

371
00:10:33,559 --> 00:10:37,119
pieces aren't jamming together or
snagging with the spine these angled

372
00:10:37,119 --> 00:10:37,129
snagging with the spine these angled

373
00:10:37,129 --> 00:10:39,519
snagging with the spine these angled
ones here we could take a piece like

374
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:39,529
ones here we could take a piece like

375
00:10:39,529 --> 00:10:43,030
ones here we could take a piece like
this fold it could fold it in the middle

376
00:10:43,030 --> 00:10:43,040
this fold it could fold it in the middle

377
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,980
this fold it could fold it in the middle
or could fold it at one end to make it

378
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:44,990
or could fold it at one end to make it

379
00:10:44,990 --> 00:10:48,069
or could fold it at one end to make it
all a bit more asymmetric you can stick

380
00:10:48,069 --> 00:10:48,079
all a bit more asymmetric you can stick

381
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:58,269
all a bit more asymmetric you can stick
a piece on onto there like that there we

382
00:10:58,269 --> 00:10:58,279
a piece on onto there like that there we

383
00:10:58,279 --> 00:11:02,239
a piece on onto there like that there we
go

384
00:11:02,239 --> 00:11:02,249


385
00:11:02,249 --> 00:11:06,689
and this one I'll cut it's a bit more of

386
00:11:06,689 --> 00:11:06,699
and this one I'll cut it's a bit more of

387
00:11:06,699 --> 00:11:09,720
and this one I'll cut it's a bit more of
a pointy angle so it'll fit in a bit

388
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:09,730
a pointy angle so it'll fit in a bit

389
00:11:09,730 --> 00:11:14,639
a pointy angle so it'll fit in a bit
better into the shape we've got that

390
00:11:14,639 --> 00:11:14,649
better into the shape we've got that

391
00:11:14,649 --> 00:11:24,860
better into the shape we've got that
should be good

392
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:24,870


393
00:11:24,870 --> 00:11:34,040
there we go fold it down so hopefully

394
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:34,050
there we go fold it down so hopefully

395
00:11:34,050 --> 00:11:35,690
there we go fold it down so hopefully
that shows you how you can use counter

396
00:11:35,690 --> 00:11:35,700
that shows you how you can use counter

397
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:37,790
that shows you how you can use counter
folds with your other pop-up shapes and

398
00:11:37,790 --> 00:11:37,800
folds with your other pop-up shapes and

399
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:40,250
folds with your other pop-up shapes and
use them to add extra planes which you

400
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:40,260
use them to add extra planes which you

401
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:41,960
use them to add extra planes which you
can then build on to make more exciting

402
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:41,970
can then build on to make more exciting

403
00:11:41,970 --> 00:11:48,410
can then build on to make more exciting
pop-ups there's one other kind I'd like

404
00:11:48,410 --> 00:11:48,420
pop-ups there's one other kind I'd like

405
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:50,450
pop-ups there's one other kind I'd like
to show you which is actually a more of

406
00:11:50,450 --> 00:11:50,460
to show you which is actually a more of

407
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:52,850
to show you which is actually a more of
a asymmetric all these ones that we

408
00:11:52,850 --> 00:11:52,860
a asymmetric all these ones that we

409
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:55,250
a asymmetric all these ones that we
looked at before was symmetric and

410
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:55,260
looked at before was symmetric and

411
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:58,730
looked at before was symmetric and
asymmetric type you can't crease the

412
00:11:58,730 --> 00:11:58,740
asymmetric type you can't crease the

413
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:01,250
asymmetric type you can't crease the
piece you're building beforehand you

414
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:01,260
piece you're building beforehand you

415
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:03,350
piece you're building beforehand you
have to think a bit ahead so if we take

416
00:12:03,350 --> 00:12:03,360
have to think a bit ahead so if we take

417
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:09,079
have to think a bit ahead so if we take
a piece like this you need to draw a

418
00:12:09,079 --> 00:12:09,089
a piece like this you need to draw a

419
00:12:09,089 --> 00:12:11,900
a piece like this you need to draw a
guideline where your spine fold is going

420
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:11,910
guideline where your spine fold is going

421
00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:14,840
guideline where your spine fold is going
to be so let's just say this is where

422
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:14,850
to be so let's just say this is where

423
00:12:14,850 --> 00:12:17,420
to be so let's just say this is where
the spine fold is going to be and then

424
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:17,430
the spine fold is going to be and then

425
00:12:17,430 --> 00:12:21,400
the spine fold is going to be and then
say this is where the bottom of your

426
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:21,410
say this is where the bottom of your

427
00:12:21,410 --> 00:12:25,700
say this is where the bottom of your
pop-up is going to be so this is going

428
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:25,710
pop-up is going to be so this is going

429
00:12:25,710 --> 00:12:27,470
pop-up is going to be so this is going
to be a crease and this is going to be a

430
00:12:27,470 --> 00:12:27,480
to be a crease and this is going to be a

431
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:29,660
to be a crease and this is going to be a
crease and then we can come up as high

432
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:29,670
crease and then we can come up as high

433
00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:35,240
crease and then we can come up as high
as we like and we'll put another crease

434
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:35,250
as we like and we'll put another crease

435
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:39,890
as we like and we'll put another crease
just here so it's going to be a crease

436
00:12:39,890 --> 00:12:39,900
just here so it's going to be a crease

437
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:43,100
just here so it's going to be a crease
there now this is the main spine fold

438
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:43,110
there now this is the main spine fold

439
00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:44,930
there now this is the main spine fold
and the distance we've come down from it

440
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:44,940
and the distance we've come down from it

441
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:46,970
and the distance we've come down from it
is the width of a ruler so I'm going to

442
00:12:46,970 --> 00:12:46,980
is the width of a ruler so I'm going to

443
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:50,240
is the width of a ruler so I'm going to
use the same thing here this is the

444
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:50,250
use the same thing here this is the

445
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:53,890
use the same thing here this is the
important thing that the this distance

446
00:12:53,890 --> 00:12:53,900
important thing that the this distance

447
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:58,790
important thing that the this distance
we call it a is the same as this

448
00:12:58,790 --> 00:12:58,800
we call it a is the same as this

449
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:03,079
we call it a is the same as this
distance we'll call that a so these two

450
00:13:03,079 --> 00:13:03,089
distance we'll call that a so these two

451
00:13:03,089 --> 00:13:08,480
distance we'll call that a so these two
are the cut lines it up here and up here

452
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:08,490
are the cut lines it up here and up here

453
00:13:08,490 --> 00:13:12,320
are the cut lines it up here and up here
and the the scored lines must never

454
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:12,330
and the the scored lines must never

455
00:13:12,330 --> 00:13:14,390
and the the scored lines must never
cross cut lines and the cut lines must

456
00:13:14,390 --> 00:13:14,400
cross cut lines and the cut lines must

457
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:17,510
cross cut lines and the cut lines must
never cross scored lines so this is the

458
00:13:17,510 --> 00:13:17,520
never cross scored lines so this is the

459
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:19,910
never cross scored lines so this is the
spine fold so the score goes from that

460
00:13:19,910 --> 00:13:19,920
spine fold so the score goes from that

461
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:24,560
spine fold so the score goes from that
cut line to the edge and this is the

462
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:24,570
cut line to the edge and this is the

463
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:26,990
cut line to the edge and this is the
bottom of the whole construction so

464
00:13:26,990 --> 00:13:27,000
bottom of the whole construction so

465
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:31,870
bottom of the whole construction so
again it goes from cut line to cut line

466
00:13:31,870 --> 00:13:31,880
again it goes from cut line to cut line

467
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:34,640
again it goes from cut line to cut line
this is going to be the leading edge

468
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:34,650
this is going to be the leading edge

469
00:13:34,650 --> 00:13:37,010
this is going to be the leading edge
jutting out so again you go from cut

470
00:13:37,010 --> 00:13:37,020
jutting out so again you go from cut

471
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:38,080
jutting out so again you go from cut
line to cut line

472
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:38,090
line to cut line

473
00:13:38,090 --> 00:13:46,360
line to cut line
and the top one so now this is going to

474
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:46,370
and the top one so now this is going to

475
00:13:46,370 --> 00:13:48,370
and the top one so now this is going to
fold there this whole thing is going to

476
00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:48,380
fold there this whole thing is going to

477
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:50,230
fold there this whole thing is going to
come forward this is going to be a

478
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:50,240
come forward this is going to be a

479
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:55,060
come forward this is going to be a
mountain fold a valley fold and the

480
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:55,070
mountain fold a valley fold and the

481
00:13:55,070 --> 00:13:57,880
mountain fold a valley fold and the
bottom is a valley fold so this is your

482
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:57,890
bottom is a valley fold so this is your

483
00:13:57,890 --> 00:14:00,340
bottom is a valley fold so this is your
your parallelogram if you want to see it

484
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:00,350
your parallelogram if you want to see it

485
00:14:00,350 --> 00:14:02,200
your parallelogram if you want to see it
more cleanly we can actually push it

486
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:02,210
more cleanly we can actually push it

487
00:14:02,210 --> 00:14:08,940
more cleanly we can actually push it
through to come out the other side so

488
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:08,950


489
00:14:08,950 --> 00:14:11,950
then you can use it that way around you

490
00:14:11,950 --> 00:14:11,960
then you can use it that way around you

491
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:14,230
then you can use it that way around you
can use it that way around and again you

492
00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:14,240
can use it that way around and again you

493
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:16,090
can use it that way around and again you
can add more counter Falls to these if

494
00:14:16,090 --> 00:14:16,100
can add more counter Falls to these if

495
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:19,000
can add more counter Falls to these if
we make a little cat in that fold it

496
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:19,010
we make a little cat in that fold it

497
00:14:19,010 --> 00:14:24,790
we make a little cat in that fold it
down so there's the parallelogram and

498
00:14:24,790 --> 00:14:24,800
down so there's the parallelogram and

499
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:28,870
down so there's the parallelogram and
there's the birds the added step to find

500
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:28,880
there's the birds the added step to find

501
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:30,790
there's the birds the added step to find
out more about these you can look at my

502
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:30,800
out more about these you can look at my

503
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:34,330
out more about these you can look at my
book pop-up design and paper mechanics

504
00:14:34,330 --> 00:14:34,340
book pop-up design and paper mechanics

505
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:36,310

and this goes into counter falls in much

506
00:14:36,310 --> 00:14:36,320
and this goes into counter falls in much

507
00:14:36,320 --> 00:15:05,890
and this goes into counter falls in much
more depth

508
00:15:05,890 --> 00:15:05,900


509
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:07,960
