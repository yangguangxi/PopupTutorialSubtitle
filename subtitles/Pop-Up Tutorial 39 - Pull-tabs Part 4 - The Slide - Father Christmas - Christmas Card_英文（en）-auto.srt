3
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:35,910
I'm going to show you how to make this

4
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:35,920
I'm going to show you how to make this

5
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:38,279
I'm going to show you how to make this
rather complicated father Christmas card

6
00:00:38,279 --> 00:00:38,289
rather complicated father Christmas card

7
00:00:38,289 --> 00:00:41,369
rather complicated father Christmas card
and when you pull the tab it reveals the

8
00:00:41,369 --> 00:00:41,379
and when you pull the tab it reveals the

9
00:00:41,379 --> 00:00:44,189
and when you pull the tab it reveals the
message it does take some measuring it

10
00:00:44,189 --> 00:00:44,199
message it does take some measuring it

11
00:00:44,199 --> 00:00:45,779
message it does take some measuring it
is quite fiddly but I'll lead you

12
00:00:45,779 --> 00:00:45,789
is quite fiddly but I'll lead you

13
00:00:45,789 --> 00:00:47,579
is quite fiddly but I'll lead you
through step by step so that you can

14
00:00:47,579 --> 00:00:47,589
through step by step so that you can

15
00:00:47,589 --> 00:00:50,369
through step by step so that you can
make your own design the pieces you need

16
00:00:50,369 --> 00:00:50,379
make your own design the pieces you need

17
00:00:50,379 --> 00:00:53,009
make your own design the pieces you need
number one is this is the base sheet

18
00:00:53,009 --> 00:00:53,019
number one is this is the base sheet

19
00:00:53,019 --> 00:00:54,930
number one is this is the base sheet
this sheet here you look at it on the

20
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:54,940
this sheet here you look at it on the

21
00:00:54,940 --> 00:00:57,329
this sheet here you look at it on the
other side and you can see when you put

22
00:00:57,329 --> 00:00:57,339
other side and you can see when you put

23
00:00:57,339 --> 00:00:59,520
other side and you can see when you put
it down here's the slot this is a slot

24
00:00:59,520 --> 00:00:59,530
it down here's the slot this is a slot

25
00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:02,099
it down here's the slot this is a slot
that I've cut in it there's a slit here

26
00:01:02,099 --> 00:01:02,109
that I've cut in it there's a slit here

27
00:01:02,109 --> 00:01:04,649
that I've cut in it there's a slit here
this is the slit here the important

28
00:01:04,649 --> 00:01:04,659
this is the slit here the important

29
00:01:04,659 --> 00:01:06,330
this is the slit here the important
thing with slits is that you cut them

30
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:06,340
thing with slits is that you cut them

31
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:09,480
thing with slits is that you cut them
back slightly at the end so a little bit

32
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:09,490
back slightly at the end so a little bit

33
00:01:09,490 --> 00:01:12,330
back slightly at the end so a little bit
of card can lift up and allow the strip

34
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:12,340
of card can lift up and allow the strip

35
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:15,209
of card can lift up and allow the strip
to move easily within it if you go to

36
00:01:15,209 --> 00:01:15,219
to move easily within it if you go to

37
00:01:15,219 --> 00:01:18,179
to move easily within it if you go to
write the strip and wobble around and

38
00:01:18,179 --> 00:01:18,189
write the strip and wobble around and

39
00:01:18,189 --> 00:01:20,880
write the strip and wobble around and
then it can actually Jam so the way I've

40
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:20,890
then it can actually Jam so the way I've

41
00:01:20,890 --> 00:01:23,880
then it can actually Jam so the way I've
done this I put the strip across it and

42
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:23,890
done this I put the strip across it and

43
00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:25,709
done this I put the strip across it and
measured how wide it needed to be and

44
00:01:25,709 --> 00:01:25,719
measured how wide it needed to be and

45
00:01:25,719 --> 00:01:28,469
measured how wide it needed to be and
just went a millimeter or so wider each

46
00:01:28,469 --> 00:01:28,479
just went a millimeter or so wider each

47
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:31,139
just went a millimeter or so wider each
side and then and cut it back as with

48
00:01:31,139 --> 00:01:31,149
side and then and cut it back as with

49
00:01:31,149 --> 00:01:32,639
side and then and cut it back as with
all these strips they need to be double

50
00:01:32,639 --> 00:01:32,649
all these strips they need to be double

51
00:01:32,649 --> 00:01:36,499
all these strips they need to be double
thickness and glued so here's the street

52
00:01:36,499 --> 00:01:36,509
thickness and glued so here's the street

53
00:01:36,509 --> 00:01:41,099
thickness and glued so here's the street
I've scored it folded it and now just

54
00:01:41,099 --> 00:01:41,109
I've scored it folded it and now just

55
00:01:41,109 --> 00:01:48,989
I've scored it folded it and now just
glue it closed I've also found with long

56
00:01:48,989 --> 00:01:48,999
glue it closed I've also found with long

57
00:01:48,999 --> 00:01:51,690
glue it closed I've also found with long
strips like this up from gluing them

58
00:01:51,690 --> 00:01:51,700
strips like this up from gluing them

59
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:54,810
strips like this up from gluing them
it's quite good if you smooth them out

60
00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:54,820
it's quite good if you smooth them out

61
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:57,149
it's quite good if you smooth them out
flat on the table otherwise they can

62
00:01:57,149 --> 00:01:57,159
flat on the table otherwise they can

63
00:01:57,159 --> 00:01:59,910
flat on the table otherwise they can
tend to sort of back in a bit or develop

64
00:01:59,910 --> 00:01:59,920
tend to sort of back in a bit or develop

65
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,739
tend to sort of back in a bit or develop
some sort of bending and so having

66
00:02:01,739 --> 00:02:01,749
some sort of bending and so having

67
00:02:01,749 --> 00:02:05,660
some sort of bending and so having
smeared the glue all over the back of it

68
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:05,670
smeared the glue all over the back of it

69
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:09,419
smeared the glue all over the back of it
and then then folded it shut

70
00:02:09,419 --> 00:02:09,429
and then then folded it shut

71
00:02:09,429 --> 00:02:12,209
and then then folded it shut
then yeah put it flat on the table and

72
00:02:12,209 --> 00:02:12,219
then yeah put it flat on the table and

73
00:02:12,219 --> 00:02:14,670
then yeah put it flat on the table and
really pile it out you've got a really

74
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:14,680
really pile it out you've got a really

75
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:18,630
really pile it out you've got a really
good flat strip the next crucial piece

76
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:18,640
good flat strip the next crucial piece

77
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,970
good flat strip the next crucial piece
is one of these so this is a piece like

78
00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:20,980
is one of these so this is a piece like

79
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:24,270
is one of these so this is a piece like
this the central bit is just a tad wider

80
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:24,280
this the central bit is just a tad wider

81
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:26,759
this the central bit is just a tad wider
than the strip and then these two other

82
00:02:26,759 --> 00:02:26,769
than the strip and then these two other

83
00:02:26,769 --> 00:02:29,879
than the strip and then these two other
bits fold in and there's two flaps left

84
00:02:29,879 --> 00:02:29,889
bits fold in and there's two flaps left

85
00:02:29,889 --> 00:02:31,649
bits fold in and there's two flaps left
on the top and that goes right at the

86
00:02:31,649 --> 00:02:31,659
on the top and that goes right at the

87
00:02:31,659 --> 00:02:35,809
on the top and that goes right at the
top of the strip so you glue the three

88
00:02:35,809 --> 00:02:35,819
top of the strip so you glue the three

89
00:02:35,819 --> 00:02:40,470
top of the strip so you glue the three
central sections once you've glued into

90
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:40,480
central sections once you've glued into

91
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,390
central sections once you've glued into
place it's good to just let it really

92
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:42,400
place it's good to just let it really

93
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,159
place it's good to just let it really
dry because with these poor stripped

94
00:02:44,159 --> 00:02:44,169
dry because with these poor stripped

95
00:02:44,169 --> 00:02:45,899
dry because with these poor stripped
mechanisms the one thing you really

96
00:02:45,899 --> 00:02:45,909
mechanisms the one thing you really

97
00:02:45,909 --> 00:02:49,050
mechanisms the one thing you really
don't want is glue oozing that just gums

98
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:49,060
don't want is glue oozing that just gums

99
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:51,170
don't want is glue oozing that just gums
it all up and stops it moving nicely

100
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:51,180
it all up and stops it moving nicely

101
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:55,949
it all up and stops it moving nicely
here is these two guys come over you can

102
00:02:55,949 --> 00:02:55,959
here is these two guys come over you can

103
00:02:55,959 --> 00:02:58,050
here is these two guys come over you can
see the creases meet at the same point

104
00:02:58,050 --> 00:02:58,060
see the creases meet at the same point

105
00:02:58,060 --> 00:03:00,300
see the creases meet at the same point
and then there's these two flaps stand

106
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:00,310
and then there's these two flaps stand

107
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:00,780
and then there's these two flaps stand
up

108
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:00,790
up

109
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:03,990
up
we're just pressed up flat you glue this

110
00:03:03,990 --> 00:03:04,000
we're just pressed up flat you glue this

111
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,399
we're just pressed up flat you glue this
piece on to the end then you stick this

112
00:03:08,399 --> 00:03:08,409
piece on to the end then you stick this

113
00:03:08,409 --> 00:03:12,690
piece on to the end then you stick this
end through the slit and then you put

114
00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:12,700
end through the slit and then you put

115
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:18,229
end through the slit and then you put
these two pieces up through that slot

116
00:03:18,229 --> 00:03:18,239
these two pieces up through that slot

117
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:24,990
these two pieces up through that slot
flatten them out put glue on them smooth

118
00:03:24,990 --> 00:03:25,000
flatten them out put glue on them smooth

119
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,819
flatten them out put glue on them smooth
it around and then this glues up pretty

120
00:03:29,819 --> 00:03:29,829
it around and then this glues up pretty

121
00:03:29,829 --> 00:03:36,000
it around and then this glues up pretty
much flush with the top so this is one

122
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:36,010
much flush with the top so this is one

123
00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:38,309
much flush with the top so this is one
of the variations on the full strip

124
00:03:38,309 --> 00:03:38,319
of the variations on the full strip

125
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:41,039
of the variations on the full strip
where you can pull a tab and make a

126
00:03:41,039 --> 00:03:41,049
where you can pull a tab and make a

127
00:03:41,049 --> 00:03:43,349
where you can pull a tab and make a
thing slide down the page this is the

128
00:03:43,349 --> 00:03:43,359
thing slide down the page this is the

129
00:03:43,359 --> 00:03:44,789
thing slide down the page this is the
amount of movement you've got at the

130
00:03:44,789 --> 00:03:44,799
amount of movement you've got at the

131
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:47,129
amount of movement you've got at the
moment so that seems to be working

132
00:03:47,129 --> 00:03:47,139
moment so that seems to be working

133
00:03:47,139 --> 00:03:49,890
moment so that seems to be working
pretty nicely so these are the other

134
00:03:49,890 --> 00:03:49,900
pretty nicely so these are the other

135
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:53,490
pretty nicely so these are the other
pieces this is this actual lineup piece

136
00:03:53,490 --> 00:03:53,500
pieces this is this actual lineup piece

137
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:56,729
pieces this is this actual lineup piece
this is going to go like this I put two

138
00:03:56,729 --> 00:03:56,739
this is going to go like this I put two

139
00:03:56,739 --> 00:04:00,119
this is going to go like this I put two
creases on each side so it can fold

140
00:04:00,119 --> 00:04:00,129
creases on each side so it can fold

141
00:04:00,129 --> 00:04:03,449
creases on each side so it can fold
round the back of the card with just a

142
00:04:03,449 --> 00:04:03,459
round the back of the card with just a

143
00:04:03,459 --> 00:04:08,460
round the back of the card with just a
bit of a beard sticking out below that's

144
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:08,470
bit of a beard sticking out below that's

145
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:12,030
bit of a beard sticking out below that's
like this this bit of beard here and

146
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:12,040
like this this bit of beard here and

147
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:14,580
like this this bit of beard here and
I've measured this so it should just fit

148
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:14,590
I've measured this so it should just fit

149
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:16,499
I've measured this so it should just fit
on there I think this needs to come down

150
00:04:16,499 --> 00:04:16,509
on there I think this needs to come down

151
00:04:16,509 --> 00:04:20,909
on there I think this needs to come down
a bit so it's about like that I've made

152
00:04:20,909 --> 00:04:20,919
a bit so it's about like that I've made

153
00:04:20,919 --> 00:04:21,990
a bit so it's about like that I've made
this skin color

154
00:04:21,990 --> 00:04:22,000
this skin color

155
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:22,700
this skin color
I've cut

156
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:22,710
I've cut

157
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:24,830
I've cut
these holes in this piece so that the

158
00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:24,840
these holes in this piece so that the

159
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:27,439
these holes in this piece so that the
eyes will show through there the pink

160
00:04:27,439 --> 00:04:27,449
eyes will show through there the pink

161
00:04:27,449 --> 00:04:29,749
eyes will show through there the pink
that will go behind the beard so I'll

162
00:04:29,749 --> 00:04:29,759
that will go behind the beard so I'll

163
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:49,129
that will go behind the beard so I'll
just glue that on as well so having

164
00:04:49,129 --> 00:04:49,139
just glue that on as well so having

165
00:04:49,139 --> 00:04:52,400
just glue that on as well so having
stuck the beard on to the skin this now

166
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:52,410
stuck the beard on to the skin this now

167
00:04:52,410 --> 00:04:55,610
stuck the beard on to the skin this now
goes on there so the beard connects that

168
00:04:55,610 --> 00:04:55,620
goes on there so the beard connects that

169
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:58,430
goes on there so the beard connects that
with the beard below it and you can see

170
00:04:58,430 --> 00:04:58,440
with the beard below it and you can see

171
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:00,740
with the beard below it and you can see
through the eye holes that I've cut into

172
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:00,750
through the eye holes that I've cut into

173
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:02,990
through the eye holes that I've cut into
the skin tone match up with the eye

174
00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:03,000
the skin tone match up with the eye

175
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,240
the skin tone match up with the eye
holes that are cutting the greenery and

176
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:05,250
holes that are cutting the greenery and

177
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:08,270
holes that are cutting the greenery and
so that can be stuck on there just

178
00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:08,280
so that can be stuck on there just

179
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:10,400
so that can be stuck on there just
before I do it I'm going to stick down

180
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:10,410
before I do it I'm going to stick down

181
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:15,260
before I do it I'm going to stick down
one side of the green put glue all down

182
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:15,270
one side of the green put glue all down

183
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:23,689
one side of the green put glue all down
one side here and this goes flush with

184
00:05:23,689 --> 00:05:23,699
one side here and this goes flush with

185
00:05:23,699 --> 00:05:27,230
one side here and this goes flush with
the top there so that's going on like

186
00:05:27,230 --> 00:05:27,240
the top there so that's going on like

187
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:31,550
the top there so that's going on like
that and we're happy with it or we can

188
00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:31,560
that and we're happy with it or we can

189
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:34,249
that and we're happy with it or we can
stick the other side down as well and

190
00:05:34,249 --> 00:05:34,259
stick the other side down as well and

191
00:05:34,259 --> 00:05:37,480
stick the other side down as well and
then this bits going to go on like this

192
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:37,490
then this bits going to go on like this

193
00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:41,649
then this bits going to go on like this
line up the beards I might need to just

194
00:05:41,649 --> 00:05:41,659
line up the beards I might need to just

195
00:05:41,659 --> 00:05:47,570
line up the beards I might need to just
trim that ever so slightly lining it up

196
00:05:47,570 --> 00:05:47,580
trim that ever so slightly lining it up

197
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:49,990
trim that ever so slightly lining it up
like that

198
00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:50,000


199
00:05:50,000 --> 00:06:04,999
you know just that

200
00:06:04,999 --> 00:06:05,009


201
00:06:05,009 --> 00:06:23,550
glue this piece down so all lines up the

202
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:23,560
glue this piece down so all lines up the

203
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:29,909
glue this piece down so all lines up the
beard the eyes so now when you pull this

204
00:06:29,909 --> 00:06:29,919
beard the eyes so now when you pull this

205
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:33,089
beard the eyes so now when you pull this
you get the extension coming down and

206
00:06:33,089 --> 00:06:33,099
you get the extension coming down and

207
00:06:33,099 --> 00:06:35,640
you get the extension coming down and
now the reason for leaving this so you

208
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:35,650
now the reason for leaving this so you

209
00:06:35,650 --> 00:06:38,129
now the reason for leaving this so you
could lift it up is now you mark where

210
00:06:38,129 --> 00:06:38,139
could lift it up is now you mark where

211
00:06:38,139 --> 00:06:41,129
could lift it up is now you mark where
the eyes are actually going to go within

212
00:06:41,129 --> 00:06:41,139
the eyes are actually going to go within

213
00:06:41,139 --> 00:06:50,010
the eyes are actually going to go within
this this is all the way up the eyes

214
00:06:50,010 --> 00:06:50,020
this this is all the way up the eyes

215
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:58,350
this this is all the way up the eyes
here and then when it comes all the way

216
00:06:58,350 --> 00:06:58,360
here and then when it comes all the way

217
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:03,809
here and then when it comes all the way
down we want the eye to be here on the

218
00:07:03,809 --> 00:07:03,819
down we want the eye to be here on the

219
00:07:03,819 --> 00:07:08,850
down we want the eye to be here on the
other side so now we can open this up

220
00:07:08,850 --> 00:07:08,860
other side so now we can open this up

221
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:12,450
other side so now we can open this up
and we join up these two marks so it's

222
00:07:12,450 --> 00:07:12,460
and we join up these two marks so it's

223
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:15,059
and we join up these two marks so it's
going to be something like you can go a

224
00:07:15,059 --> 00:07:15,069
going to be something like you can go a

225
00:07:15,069 --> 00:07:18,570
going to be something like you can go a
little bit actually a bit wider this is

226
00:07:18,570 --> 00:07:18,580
little bit actually a bit wider this is

227
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:36,470
little bit actually a bit wider this is
the eye and we can just shade that in

228
00:07:36,470 --> 00:07:36,480


229
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:43,400
and just check that so you close this up

230
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:43,410


231
00:07:43,410 --> 00:07:48,720
push it up pull it down you can see how

232
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:48,730
push it up pull it down you can see how

233
00:07:48,730 --> 00:07:51,540
push it up pull it down you can see how
the eyes are moving if you're happy with

234
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:51,550
the eyes are moving if you're happy with

235
00:07:51,550 --> 00:07:53,390
the eyes are moving if you're happy with
that and you've shaded them in enough

236
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:53,400
that and you've shaded them in enough

237
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:56,040
that and you've shaded them in enough
then you can stick this other side down

238
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:56,050
then you can stick this other side down

239
00:07:56,050 --> 00:08:11,990
then you can stick this other side down
so you put the glue in there there we go

240
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:12,000
so you put the glue in there there we go

241
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,580
so you put the glue in there there we go
with these when you're sticking the

242
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:14,590
with these when you're sticking the

243
00:08:14,590 --> 00:08:17,130
with these when you're sticking the
white bit which has the eyes on it and

244
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:17,140
white bit which has the eyes on it and

245
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:19,050
white bit which has the eyes on it and
which is the beard on underneath all

246
00:08:19,050 --> 00:08:19,060
which is the beard on underneath all

247
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:20,730
which is the beard on underneath all
this the white is going right up to the

248
00:08:20,730 --> 00:08:20,740
this the white is going right up to the

249
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:22,800
this the white is going right up to the
top here so we've got to leave enough

250
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:22,810
top here so we've got to leave enough

251
00:08:22,810 --> 00:08:26,640
top here so we've got to leave enough
space for the eyes as you pull down for

252
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:26,650
space for the eyes as you pull down for

253
00:08:26,650 --> 00:08:28,380
space for the eyes as you pull down for
the ice to be accommodated

254
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:28,390
the ice to be accommodated

255
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:31,650
the ice to be accommodated
when this bit comes down you have to

256
00:08:31,650 --> 00:08:31,660
when this bit comes down you have to

257
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:33,360
when this bit comes down you have to
make sure it's not coming down so far as

258
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:33,370
make sure it's not coming down so far as

259
00:08:33,370 --> 00:08:36,060
make sure it's not coming down so far as
it actually appears under here when you

260
00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:36,070
it actually appears under here when you

261
00:08:36,070 --> 00:08:40,829
it actually appears under here when you
pull down the beard so now you've got

262
00:08:40,829 --> 00:08:40,839
pull down the beard so now you've got

263
00:08:40,839 --> 00:08:44,130
pull down the beard so now you've got
this pull strip is much too long so of

264
00:08:44,130 --> 00:08:44,140
this pull strip is much too long so of

265
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:46,440
this pull strip is much too long so of
course you push it up to it fully pushed

266
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:46,450
course you push it up to it fully pushed

267
00:08:46,450 --> 00:08:52,770
course you push it up to it fully pushed
up position and just snip it off as it

268
00:08:52,770 --> 00:08:52,780
up position and just snip it off as it

269
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:54,720
up position and just snip it off as it
happens I've got the snuff about the

270
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:54,730
happens I've got the snuff about the

271
00:08:54,730 --> 00:08:57,210
happens I've got the snuff about the
right length so the amount it moves is

272
00:08:57,210 --> 00:08:57,220
right length so the amount it moves is

273
00:08:57,220 --> 00:08:59,520
right length so the amount it moves is
pretty much exactly right but if you've

274
00:08:59,520 --> 00:08:59,530
pretty much exactly right but if you've

275
00:08:59,530 --> 00:09:02,370
pretty much exactly right but if you've
made this lot a bit too long so this one

276
00:09:02,370 --> 00:09:02,380
made this lot a bit too long so this one

277
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:05,520
made this lot a bit too long so this one
before when you when you pulled it you

278
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:05,530
before when you when you pulled it you

279
00:09:05,530 --> 00:09:07,440
before when you when you pulled it you
actually it went too fast or the eyes

280
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:07,450
actually it went too fast or the eyes

281
00:09:07,450 --> 00:09:08,910
actually it went too fast or the eyes
started showing so you can actually

282
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:08,920
started showing so you can actually

283
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:11,760
started showing so you can actually
govern that by putting a piece across

284
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:11,770
govern that by putting a piece across

285
00:09:11,770 --> 00:09:13,710
govern that by putting a piece across
like this this piece is stuck across

286
00:09:13,710 --> 00:09:13,720
like this this piece is stuck across

287
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:16,050
like this this piece is stuck across
it's stuck to the strip so as you pull

288
00:09:16,050 --> 00:09:16,060
it's stuck to the strip so as you pull

289
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:18,420
it's stuck to the strip so as you pull
it down it comes to rest against this

290
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:18,430
it down it comes to rest against this

291
00:09:18,430 --> 00:09:21,780
it down it comes to rest against this
knit so that stops the movement so you

292
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:21,790
knit so that stops the movement so you

293
00:09:21,790 --> 00:09:24,150
knit so that stops the movement so you
can govern and affect the amount of

294
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:24,160
can govern and affect the amount of

295
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:25,740
can govern and affect the amount of
movement you're getting by adding things

296
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:25,750
movement you're getting by adding things

297
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:28,380
movement you're getting by adding things
like this better to have this slot cut

298
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:28,390
like this better to have this slot cut

299
00:09:28,390 --> 00:09:30,690
like this better to have this slot cut
too long and then use one of these to

300
00:09:30,690 --> 00:09:30,700
too long and then use one of these to

301
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:32,490
too long and then use one of these to
control the movement then have the whole

302
00:09:32,490 --> 00:09:32,500
control the movement then have the whole

303
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:34,110
control the movement then have the whole
thing too short so you can't actually

304
00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:34,120
thing too short so you can't actually

305
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:37,710
thing too short so you can't actually
make it do what you want so now you can

306
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:37,720
make it do what you want so now you can

307
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:40,020
make it do what you want so now you can
add your message you know you might not

308
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:40,030
add your message you know you might not

309
00:09:40,030 --> 00:09:40,780
add your message you know you might not
want to say

310
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:40,790
want to say

311
00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:41,980
want to say
for Christmas you might want to say

312
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:41,990
for Christmas you might want to say

313
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:44,950
for Christmas you might want to say
something else that's up to you

314
00:09:44,950 --> 00:09:44,960
something else that's up to you

315
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:47,260
something else that's up to you
that will fits in there then the last

316
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:47,270
that will fits in there then the last

317
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:51,510
that will fits in there then the last
thing to do is just add these bits of

318
00:09:51,510 --> 00:09:51,520
thing to do is just add these bits of

319
00:09:51,520 --> 00:10:09,390
thing to do is just add these bits of
festive Reds so the width of the head

320
00:10:09,390 --> 00:10:09,400
festive Reds so the width of the head

321
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:14,740
festive Reds so the width of the head
it's about like that and then round it

322
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:14,750
it's about like that and then round it

323
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:22,000
it's about like that and then round it
off of it seems to be okay so I'll stick

324
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:22,010
off of it seems to be okay so I'll stick

325
00:10:22,010 --> 00:10:37,030
off of it seems to be okay so I'll stick
that on there I want to draw some

326
00:10:37,030 --> 00:10:37,040

400
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:22,310
score just here and ideally you'd have

401
00:13:22,310 --> 00:13:24,970
score just here and ideally you'd have
