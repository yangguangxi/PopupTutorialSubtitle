00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:38,030
I'm going to show you how to make an

4
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:38,040
I'm going to show you how to make an

5
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:40,670
I'm going to show you how to make an
opening flower mechanism that is based

6
00:00:40,670 --> 00:00:40,680
opening flower mechanism that is based

7
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:44,390
opening flower mechanism that is based
on a design from the 1930s they first

8
00:00:44,390 --> 00:00:44,400
on a design from the 1930s they first

00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:47,030
on a design from the 1930s they first
appeared in the Daily Express children's

10
00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:47,040
appeared in the Daily Express children's

00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:50,780
appeared in the Daily Express children's
annual number three here it is it's

12
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:50,790
annual number three here it is it's

13
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:54,590
annual number three here it is it's
called the flower fairy he's got some

14
00:00:54,590 --> 00:00:54,600
called the flower fairy he's got some

15
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:57,470
called the flower fairy he's got some
quite complicated folding underneath

16
00:00:57,470 --> 00:00:57,480
quite complicated folding underneath

17
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:59,540
quite complicated folding underneath
that raises the flower up off the page

18
00:00:59,540 --> 00:00:59,550
that raises the flower up off the page

19
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:02,600
that raises the flower up off the page
and I can't quite work out why he did

20
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:02,610
and I can't quite work out why he did

21
00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:04,520
and I can't quite work out why he did
that I think it might be because the

22
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:04,530
that I think it might be because the

23
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:06,980
that I think it might be because the
card is used is very thin and flimsy and

24
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:06,990
card is used is very thin and flimsy and

25
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:09,080
card is used is very thin and flimsy and
bendy and so he wanted some of it double

26
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:09,090
bendy and so he wanted some of it double

27
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:10,790
bendy and so he wanted some of it double
to give it the strength to lift the

28
00:01:10,790 --> 00:01:10,800
to give it the strength to lift the

29
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:12,680
to give it the strength to lift the
flower up and the version I'm going to

30
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:12,690
flower up and the version I'm going to

31
00:01:12,690 --> 00:01:14,870
flower up and the version I'm going to
show you is a little more simple so this

32
00:01:14,870 --> 00:01:14,880
show you is a little more simple so this

33
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:17,090
show you is a little more simple so this
is they'll express children's annual

34
00:01:17,090 --> 00:01:17,100
is they'll express children's annual

35
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:20,660
is they'll express children's annual
number three and then the same design

36
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:20,670
number three and then the same design

37
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:23,240
number three and then the same design
more or less was repeated later in the

38
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:23,250
more or less was repeated later in the

39
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:25,820
more or less was repeated later in the
30s I believe in this book are no

40
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:25,830
30s I believe in this book are no

41
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:28,880
30s I believe in this book are no
stories number ten and here's the design

42
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:28,890
stories number ten and here's the design

43
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:31,760
stories number ten and here's the design
that time and you can see the flower is

44
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:31,770
that time and you can see the flower is

45
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:34,310
that time and you can see the flower is
smaller it's lower on the page it's the

46
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:34,320
smaller it's lower on the page it's the

47
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:36,950
smaller it's lower on the page it's the
same basic mechanism the different

48
00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:36,960
same basic mechanism the different

49
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:39,590
same basic mechanism the different
artwork but the same basic mechanism so

50
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:39,600
artwork but the same basic mechanism so

51
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,420
artwork but the same basic mechanism so
now I'll show you how to make that I'll

52
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:41,430
now I'll show you how to make that I'll

53
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:47,000
now I'll show you how to make that I'll
start with a flower and just cut a rough

54
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:47,010
start with a flower and just cut a rough

55
00:01:47,010 --> 00:01:53,480
start with a flower and just cut a rough
square so I'll just just cut the corners

56
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:53,490
square so I'll just just cut the corners

57
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:55,399
square so I'll just just cut the corners
off and show you how to make the flower

58
00:01:55,399 --> 00:01:55,409
off and show you how to make the flower

59
00:01:55,409 --> 00:01:58,130
off and show you how to make the flower
then I'll show you the mechanism that

60
00:01:58,130 --> 00:01:58,140
then I'll show you the mechanism that

61
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:00,830
then I'll show you the mechanism that
that raises it up so this is what we

62
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:00,840
that raises it up so this is what we

63
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:03,289
that raises it up so this is what we
will be aiming for this is the flower

64
00:02:03,289 --> 00:02:03,299
will be aiming for this is the flower

65
00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:06,920
will be aiming for this is the flower
raised up on a very basic v-fold this is

66
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:06,930
raised up on a very basic v-fold this is

67
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:09,919
raised up on a very basic v-fold this is
a right-angle v-fold without increases

68
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:09,929
a right-angle v-fold without increases

69
00:02:09,929 --> 00:02:12,710
a right-angle v-fold without increases
on the top that creates a gully that you

70
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:12,720
on the top that creates a gully that you

71
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:15,050
on the top that creates a gully that you
stick the flour into you I tried

72
00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:15,060
stick the flour into you I tried

73
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:17,900
stick the flour into you I tried
following the earlier design which has

74
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:17,910
following the earlier design which has

75
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:21,950
following the earlier design which has
these holes cut in it that give it more

76
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:21,960
these holes cut in it that give it more

77
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:25,250
these holes cut in it that give it more
delicacy but with the design that I've

78
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:25,260
delicacy but with the design that I've

79
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:28,010
delicacy but with the design that I've
made it doesn't look quite right so I

80
00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:28,020
made it doesn't look quite right so I

81
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:29,630
made it doesn't look quite right so I
might do it slightly differently this

82
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:29,640
might do it slightly differently this

83
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:32,510
might do it slightly differently this
time but let's just scope for you to

84
00:02:32,510 --> 00:02:32,520
time but let's just scope for you to

85
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:34,910
time but let's just scope for you to
play with it and work out you know what

86
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:34,920
play with it and work out you know what

87
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:37,490
play with it and work out you know what
you'd like to make really so this is the

88
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:37,500
you'd like to make really so this is the

89
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:46,490
you'd like to make really so this is the
basic flour fold it in half and then we

90
00:02:46,490 --> 00:02:46,500
basic flour fold it in half and then we

91
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:49,520
basic flour fold it in half and then we
need these two diagonals so I'll just

92
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:49,530
need these two diagonals so I'll just

93
00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:56,570
need these two diagonals so I'll just
use the set square to measure those that

94
00:02:56,570 --> 00:02:56,580
use the set square to measure those that

95
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:59,620
use the set square to measure those that
would line up the central crease on the

96
00:02:59,620 --> 00:02:59,630
would line up the central crease on the

97
00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:01,820
would line up the central crease on the
projector with the central crease on

98
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:01,830
projector with the central crease on

99
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:06,080
projector with the central crease on
that and that pop-up now I'm going to

100
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:06,090
that and that pop-up now I'm going to

101
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:09,850
that and that pop-up now I'm going to
score these they're both at 45 degrees

102
00:03:09,850 --> 00:03:09,860
score these they're both at 45 degrees

103
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:16,910
score these they're both at 45 degrees
and on this side as well and I'm going

104
00:03:16,910 --> 00:03:16,920
and on this side as well and I'm going

105
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:23,830
and on this side as well and I'm going
to extend them right across the flower

106
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:23,840


107
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:32,630
and this one so this will give us the

108
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:32,640
and this one so this will give us the

109
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:38,030
and this one so this will give us the
basic flower shape these two bits will

110
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:38,040
basic flower shape these two bits will

111
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:40,040
basic flower shape these two bits will
come forward and these two bits go back

112
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:40,050
come forward and these two bits go back

113
00:03:40,050 --> 00:03:42,170
come forward and these two bits go back
there we are and then I'll just press it

114
00:03:42,170 --> 00:03:42,180
there we are and then I'll just press it

115
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:44,750
there we are and then I'll just press it
down just to make sure it's working and

116
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:44,760
down just to make sure it's working and

117
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:48,050
down just to make sure it's working and
then that's the basic flower

118
00:03:48,050 --> 00:03:48,060
then that's the basic flower

119
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:50,600
then that's the basic flower
so I've got a base sheet and then I'm

120
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:50,610
so I've got a base sheet and then I'm

121
00:03:50,610 --> 00:03:53,930
so I've got a base sheet and then I'm
going to want some green to make the the

122
00:03:53,930 --> 00:03:53,940
going to want some green to make the the

123
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:58,100
going to want some green to make the the
stand for the flowers so did have some

124
00:03:58,100 --> 00:03:58,110
stand for the flowers so did have some

125
00:03:58,110 --> 00:04:06,320
stand for the flowers so did have some
green here I'll make the base there's

126
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:06,330
green here I'll make the base there's

127
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:09,050
green here I'll make the base there's
the base now we need one of these

128
00:04:09,050 --> 00:04:09,060
the base now we need one of these

129
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:11,210
the base now we need one of these
species because he's going to stick on

130
00:04:11,210 --> 00:04:11,220
species because he's going to stick on

131
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:14,300
species because he's going to stick on
like this it'll fold forward and the

132
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:14,310
like this it'll fold forward and the

133
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:16,670
like this it'll fold forward and the
flowers stick on the top so we'll just

134
00:04:16,670 --> 00:04:16,680
flowers stick on the top so we'll just

135
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:27,100
flowers stick on the top so we'll just
take a small piece of card like this

136
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:27,110


137
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:34,510
fold it in half crease it really well

138
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:34,520


139
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:37,280
this is a right angle V fold so we're

140
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:37,290
this is a right angle V fold so we're

141
00:04:37,290 --> 00:04:39,260
this is a right angle V fold so we're
going to make a crease along the bottom

142
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:39,270
going to make a crease along the bottom

143
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:43,430
going to make a crease along the bottom
one centimeter up all at right angles

144
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:43,440
one centimeter up all at right angles

145
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:49,070
one centimeter up all at right angles
again crease it really well cut out that

146
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:49,080
again crease it really well cut out that

147
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:56,690
again crease it really well cut out that
corner cut that off as well fold the

148
00:04:56,690 --> 00:04:56,700
corner cut that off as well fold the

149
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:58,520
corner cut that off as well fold the
pieces separately so I can really

150
00:04:58,520 --> 00:04:58,530
pieces separately so I can really

151
00:04:58,530 --> 00:05:01,409
pieces separately so I can really
reinforce those

152
00:05:01,409 --> 00:05:01,419
reinforce those

153
00:05:01,419 --> 00:05:02,939
reinforce those
so these are going to stick on the page

154
00:05:02,939 --> 00:05:02,949
so these are going to stick on the page

155
00:05:02,949 --> 00:05:06,149
so these are going to stick on the page
like this and now we want the extra

156
00:05:06,149 --> 00:05:06,159
like this and now we want the extra

157
00:05:06,159 --> 00:05:09,089
like this and now we want the extra
creases that add to the gully so I'll do

158
00:05:09,089 --> 00:05:09,099
creases that add to the gully so I'll do

159
00:05:09,099 --> 00:05:15,089
creases that add to the gully so I'll do
it up something like that and bold that

160
00:05:15,089 --> 00:05:15,099
it up something like that and bold that

161
00:05:15,099 --> 00:05:18,270
it up something like that and bold that
well and this is a this is a counter

162
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:18,280
well and this is a this is a counter

163
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:22,260
well and this is a this is a counter
fold so we push that through and now

164
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:22,270
fold so we push that through and now

165
00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:25,140
fold so we push that through and now
when this is stuck down this is going to

166
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:25,150
when this is stuck down this is going to

167
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:28,350
when this is stuck down this is going to
be like that

168
00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:28,360


169
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:31,420
the other path of this mechanism rather

170
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:31,430
the other path of this mechanism rather

171
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:34,120
the other path of this mechanism rather
the design rather than the mechanism is

172
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:34,130
the design rather than the mechanism is

173
00:05:34,130 --> 00:05:37,210
the design rather than the mechanism is
this bit at the back this is giving you

174
00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:37,220
this bit at the back this is giving you

175
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:39,730
this bit at the back this is giving you
the extra leaves that stick up above the

176
00:05:39,730 --> 00:05:39,740
the extra leaves that stick up above the

177
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:44,500
the extra leaves that stick up above the
flower this is an obtuse angle v-fold so

178
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:44,510
flower this is an obtuse angle v-fold so

179
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:47,770
flower this is an obtuse angle v-fold so
as it folds down this this folds down

180
00:05:47,770 --> 00:05:47,780
as it folds down this this folds down

181
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:51,120
as it folds down this this folds down
that way so when we come to sticking

182
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:51,130
that way so when we come to sticking

183
00:05:51,130 --> 00:05:54,490
that way so when we come to sticking
this on to the page this is going to

184
00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:54,500
this on to the page this is going to

185
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:56,830
this on to the page this is going to
stick on the page with the flower like

186
00:05:56,830 --> 00:05:56,840
stick on the page with the flower like

187
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:59,230
stick on the page with the flower like
that and this is going to fold that way

188
00:05:59,230 --> 00:05:59,240
that and this is going to fold that way

189
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:01,750
that and this is going to fold that way
but at the same time we're going to have

190
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:01,760
but at the same time we're going to have

191
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:04,450
but at the same time we're going to have
these two leaves behind it they're going

192
00:06:04,450 --> 00:06:04,460
these two leaves behind it they're going

193
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:06,430
these two leaves behind it they're going
to fold down the other way so we need to

194
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:06,440
to fold down the other way so we need to

195
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:09,370
to fold down the other way so we need to
position this maybe around the middle

196
00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:09,380
position this maybe around the middle

197
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:12,250
position this maybe around the middle
there and now we can put the flower is

198
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:12,260
there and now we can put the flower is

199
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:16,200
there and now we can put the flower is
going to stick into that gully

200
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:16,210


201
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:19,499
so when I test this and try putting the

202
00:06:19,499 --> 00:06:19,509
so when I test this and try putting the

203
00:06:19,509 --> 00:06:21,540
so when I test this and try putting the
flower into that you can see it's going

204
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:21,550
flower into that you can see it's going

205
00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:24,150
flower into that you can see it's going
to be too big for the base so I'm going

206
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:24,160
to be too big for the base so I'm going

207
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,939
to be too big for the base so I'm going
to pull this off because it hasn't stuck

208
00:06:26,939 --> 00:06:26,949
to pull this off because it hasn't stuck

209
00:06:26,949 --> 00:06:28,740
to pull this off because it hasn't stuck
really firmly yet and I'm going to make

210
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:28,750
really firmly yet and I'm going to make

211
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:33,529
really firmly yet and I'm going to make
it shorter so I cut a piece off there

212
00:06:33,529 --> 00:06:33,539
it shorter so I cut a piece off there

213
00:06:33,539 --> 00:06:43,790
it shorter so I cut a piece off there
and add creases and cut that corner out

214
00:06:43,790 --> 00:06:43,800


215
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:49,350
and fold those back on themselves so

216
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:49,360
and fold those back on themselves so

217
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:52,999
and fold those back on themselves so
this is going to go in like that and

218
00:06:52,999 --> 00:06:53,009
this is going to go in like that and

219
00:06:53,009 --> 00:06:55,469
this is going to go in like that and
it's still not not working I'll have to

220
00:06:55,469 --> 00:06:55,479
it's still not not working I'll have to

221
00:06:55,479 --> 00:06:58,290
it's still not not working I'll have to
make the flower smaller now we stick the

222
00:06:58,290 --> 00:06:58,300
make the flower smaller now we stick the

223
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:01,050
make the flower smaller now we stick the
flower into that but before we stick it

224
00:07:01,050 --> 00:07:01,060
flower into that but before we stick it

225
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:03,749
flower into that but before we stick it
into that gully let's just check how

226
00:07:03,749 --> 00:07:03,759
into that gully let's just check how

227
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:08,040
into that gully let's just check how
it's gonna sit on the page not too bad I

228
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:08,050
it's gonna sit on the page not too bad I

229
00:07:08,050 --> 00:07:10,800
it's gonna sit on the page not too bad I
might just cut a little bit more off it

230
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:10,810
might just cut a little bit more off it

231
00:07:10,810 --> 00:07:12,960
might just cut a little bit more off it
so I'll make the flower a little bit

232
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:12,970
so I'll make the flower a little bit

233
00:07:12,970 --> 00:07:21,120
so I'll make the flower a little bit
smaller I can also make it a little bit

234
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:21,130
smaller I can also make it a little bit

235
00:07:21,130 --> 00:07:23,760
smaller I can also make it a little bit
more delicate cutting pieces out of

236
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:23,770
more delicate cutting pieces out of

237
00:07:23,770 --> 00:07:26,310
more delicate cutting pieces out of
these corners just to give it slightly

238
00:07:26,310 --> 00:07:26,320
these corners just to give it slightly

239
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:34,529
these corners just to give it slightly
more petal defect so now I'll stick this

240
00:07:34,529 --> 00:07:34,539
more petal defect so now I'll stick this

241
00:07:34,539 --> 00:07:51,110
more petal defect so now I'll stick this
into that gully that I've created there

242
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:51,120


243
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:55,320
quite achieved the the openness that

244
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:55,330
quite achieved the the openness that

245
00:07:55,330 --> 00:08:00,150
quite achieved the the openness that
Jareau got with his flower design a pull

246
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:00,160
Jareau got with his flower design a pull

247
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,280
Jareau got with his flower design a pull
the flower off I'm not happy with these

248
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:02,290
the flower off I'm not happy with these

249
00:08:02,290 --> 00:08:03,780
the flower off I'm not happy with these
angles that they're just keeping the

250
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:03,790
angles that they're just keeping the

251
00:08:03,790 --> 00:08:05,790
angles that they're just keeping the
flower more close than I want if you

252
00:08:05,790 --> 00:08:05,800
flower more close than I want if you

253
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,860
flower more close than I want if you
look at this the flower is much more

254
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:07,870
look at this the flower is much more

255
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:11,310
look at this the flower is much more
open if you look at this the flower is

256
00:08:11,310 --> 00:08:11,320
open if you look at this the flower is

257
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:13,710
open if you look at this the flower is
even more open I'm going to take off

258
00:08:13,710 --> 00:08:13,720
even more open I'm going to take off

259
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:18,150
even more open I'm going to take off
this green piece and I'm going to use

260
00:08:18,150 --> 00:08:18,160
this green piece and I'm going to use

261
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,860
this green piece and I'm going to use
this piece that I was experimenting with

262
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:19,870
this piece that I was experimenting with

263
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:22,530
this piece that I was experimenting with
yesterday if you compare the two angles

264
00:08:22,530 --> 00:08:22,540
yesterday if you compare the two angles

265
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:25,650
yesterday if you compare the two angles
the angles on the fold on this piece and

266
00:08:25,650 --> 00:08:25,660
the angles on the fold on this piece and

267
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:27,420
the angles on the fold on this piece and
much better than the angles on the fold

268
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:27,430
much better than the angles on the fold

269
00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:30,060
much better than the angles on the fold
on this piece I think maybe this piece

270
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:30,070
on this piece I think maybe this piece

271
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:32,430
on this piece I think maybe this piece
is still a little bit high considering

272
00:08:32,430 --> 00:08:32,440
is still a little bit high considering

273
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:33,659
is still a little bit high considering
you're gonna have to have an obtuse

274
00:08:33,659 --> 00:08:33,669
you're gonna have to have an obtuse

275
00:08:33,669 --> 00:08:35,850
you're gonna have to have an obtuse
angle V fall behind it so I'm going to

276
00:08:35,850 --> 00:08:35,860
angle V fall behind it so I'm going to

277
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:38,310
angle V fall behind it so I'm going to
make this piece slightly smaller I'm

278
00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:38,320
make this piece slightly smaller I'm

279
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:42,290
make this piece slightly smaller I'm
going to take off a piece there and

280
00:08:42,290 --> 00:08:42,300
going to take off a piece there and

281
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:46,980
going to take off a piece there and
refold those this is going to be like

282
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:46,990
refold those this is going to be like

283
00:08:46,990 --> 00:08:53,780
refold those this is going to be like
that

284
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:53,790


285
00:08:53,790 --> 00:09:01,000
and take out that corner

286
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:01,010


287
00:09:01,010 --> 00:09:03,910
now try again like that I think with any

288
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:03,920
now try again like that I think with any

289
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:10,290
now try again like that I think with any
luck it'll be a much better flower I

290
00:09:10,290 --> 00:09:10,300


291
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:13,269
want it like that I'm sticking one side

292
00:09:13,269 --> 00:09:13,279
want it like that I'm sticking one side

293
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:24,430
want it like that I'm sticking one side
down closing it closing it again that

294
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:24,440
down closing it closing it again that

295
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:26,620
down closing it closing it again that
looks like a much better angle in the

296
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:26,630
looks like a much better angle in the

297
00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:28,269
looks like a much better angle in the
middle for sticking the flower on to

298
00:09:28,269 --> 00:09:28,279
middle for sticking the flower on to

299
00:09:28,279 --> 00:09:32,230
middle for sticking the flower on to
just let that glue go off of slightly

300
00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:32,240
just let that glue go off of slightly

301
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:52,829
just let that glue go off of slightly
overdone it stick the flower on there

302
00:09:52,829 --> 00:09:52,839


303
00:09:52,839 --> 00:10:01,030
right let's try this and shut it to make

304
00:10:01,030 --> 00:10:01,040
right let's try this and shut it to make

305
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:10,240
right let's try this and shut it to make
sure it's all working seems to be it's

306
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:10,250
sure it's all working seems to be it's

307
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:13,600
sure it's all working seems to be it's
like a better flower this time and you

308
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:13,610
like a better flower this time and you

309
00:10:13,610 --> 00:10:17,019
like a better flower this time and you
think I'm an expert right now I put the

310
00:10:17,019 --> 00:10:17,029
think I'm an expert right now I put the

311
00:10:17,029 --> 00:10:19,120
think I'm an expert right now I put the
leaves behind it that is slightly

312
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:19,130
leaves behind it that is slightly

313
00:10:19,130 --> 00:10:21,009
leaves behind it that is slightly
heavier green I'm not quite happy with

314
00:10:21,009 --> 00:10:21,019
heavier green I'm not quite happy with

315
00:10:21,019 --> 00:10:24,819
heavier green I'm not quite happy with
it this is it so I'll just take about a

316
00:10:24,819 --> 00:10:24,829
it this is it so I'll just take about a

317
00:10:24,829 --> 00:10:38,829
it this is it so I'll just take about a
third of a sheet fold it in half now

318
00:10:38,829 --> 00:10:38,839
third of a sheet fold it in half now

319
00:10:38,839 --> 00:10:41,590
third of a sheet fold it in half now
mostly falls the acutely folds that the

320
00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:41,600
mostly falls the acutely folds that the

321
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:44,079
mostly falls the acutely folds that the
ones we mostly use when you fold the

322
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:44,089
ones we mostly use when you fold the

323
00:10:44,089 --> 00:10:45,519
ones we mostly use when you fold the
creases on the bottom to make the tabs

324
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:45,529
creases on the bottom to make the tabs

325
00:10:45,529 --> 00:10:48,579
creases on the bottom to make the tabs
you make the creases form a downward

326
00:10:48,579 --> 00:10:48,589
you make the creases form a downward

327
00:10:48,589 --> 00:10:50,980
you make the creases form a downward
pointing arrow in this case we want it

328
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:50,990
pointing arrow in this case we want it

329
00:10:50,990 --> 00:10:53,319
pointing arrow in this case we want it
to be an obtuse angle v-fold so we're

330
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:53,329
to be an obtuse angle v-fold so we're

331
00:10:53,329 --> 00:10:55,180
to be an obtuse angle v-fold so we're
going to make the creases come up

332
00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:55,190
going to make the creases come up

333
00:10:55,190 --> 00:11:03,490
going to make the creases come up
towards the spine like this when you

334
00:11:03,490 --> 00:11:03,500
towards the spine like this when you

335
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:07,389
towards the spine like this when you
open this up you can see the creases

336
00:11:07,389 --> 00:11:07,399
open this up you can see the creases

337
00:11:07,399 --> 00:11:09,429
open this up you can see the creases
make an upward pointing arrow and

338
00:11:09,429 --> 00:11:09,439
make an upward pointing arrow and

339
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:12,070
make an upward pointing arrow and
they'll cut that to make

340
00:11:12,070 --> 00:11:12,080
they'll cut that to make

341
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:18,580
they'll cut that to make
I want it smaller than that but maybe a

342
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:18,590
I want it smaller than that but maybe a

343
00:11:18,590 --> 00:11:25,540
I want it smaller than that but maybe a
bit more leaf-shaped so this should be

344
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:25,550
bit more leaf-shaped so this should be

345
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:30,870
bit more leaf-shaped so this should be
able to go behind the flower standing up

346
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:30,880
able to go behind the flower standing up

347
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,890
able to go behind the flower standing up
something like that

348
00:11:32,890 --> 00:11:32,900
something like that

349
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:35,560
something like that
I'll stick one side and then the other

350
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:35,570
I'll stick one side and then the other

351
00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:37,720
I'll stick one side and then the other
but normally because of their flower

352
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:37,730
but normally because of their flower

353
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:39,640
but normally because of their flower
it's all a bit complicated so I'll just

354
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:39,650
it's all a bit complicated so I'll just

355
00:11:39,650 --> 00:11:42,520
it's all a bit complicated so I'll just
try and do this by eye shut it quickly

356
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:42,530
try and do this by eye shut it quickly

357
00:11:42,530 --> 00:11:45,070
try and do this by eye shut it quickly
so if the pieces need to move they can

358
00:11:45,070 --> 00:11:45,080
so if the pieces need to move they can

359
00:11:45,080 --> 00:12:03,110
so if the pieces need to move they can
move while the glue is still soft

360
00:12:03,110 --> 00:12:03,120


361
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,790
no well it's still soft I'll shut it

362
00:12:05,790 --> 00:12:05,800
no well it's still soft I'll shut it

363
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:11,310
no well it's still soft I'll shut it
down the way this is stuck on the angles

364
00:12:11,310 --> 00:12:11,320
down the way this is stuck on the angles

365
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:13,020
down the way this is stuck on the angles
I've got here on this obtuse angle

366
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:13,030
I've got here on this obtuse angle

367
00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:14,760
I've got here on this obtuse angle
v-fold they're obviously something wrong

368
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:14,770
v-fold they're obviously something wrong

369
00:12:14,770 --> 00:12:16,860
v-fold they're obviously something wrong
so I'm going to pull the whole thing off

370
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:16,870
so I'm going to pull the whole thing off

371
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:19,460
so I'm going to pull the whole thing off
while the glue still sticky I'm going to

372
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:19,470
while the glue still sticky I'm going to

373
00:12:19,470 --> 00:12:23,640
while the glue still sticky I'm going to
change the angles and stick it on with a

374
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:23,650
change the angles and stick it on with a

375
00:12:23,650 --> 00:12:26,220
change the angles and stick it on with a
tighter angle on the base so you can

376
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:26,230
tighter angle on the base so you can

377
00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:28,080
tighter angle on the base so you can
bring the leaves in much closer to the

378
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:28,090
bring the leaves in much closer to the

379
00:12:28,090 --> 00:12:30,930
bring the leaves in much closer to the
flower and now put the glue on those and

380
00:12:30,930 --> 00:12:30,940
flower and now put the glue on those and

381
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:40,740
flower and now put the glue on those and
glue it into place I'll do them both at

382
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:40,750
glue it into place I'll do them both at

383
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:42,660
glue it into place I'll do them both at
the same time and then we will shut it

384
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:42,670
the same time and then we will shut it

385
00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:44,280
the same time and then we will shut it
while the glue soft so if they need to

386
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:44,290
while the glue soft so if they need to

387
00:12:44,290 --> 00:12:46,400
while the glue soft so if they need to
shift around at all they can still move

388
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:46,410
shift around at all they can still move

389
00:12:46,410 --> 00:12:52,470
shift around at all they can still move
so it's more like this so it's like that

390
00:12:52,470 --> 00:12:52,480
so it's more like this so it's like that

391
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,710
so it's more like this so it's like that
I'll just shut it make sure it works

392
00:12:54,710 --> 00:12:54,720
I'll just shut it make sure it works

393
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:59,310
I'll just shut it make sure it works
yeah that's fine so there it is if I

394
00:12:59,310 --> 00:12:59,320
yeah that's fine so there it is if I

395
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:02,160
yeah that's fine so there it is if I
turn it around in fact you can see a bit

396
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:02,170
turn it around in fact you can see a bit

397
00:13:02,170 --> 00:13:03,420
turn it around in fact you can see a bit
of yellow where I've pulled it off the

398
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:03,430
of yellow where I've pulled it off the

399
00:13:03,430 --> 00:13:06,000
of yellow where I've pulled it off the
page but that's the angle that the whole

400
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:06,010
page but that's the angle that the whole

401
00:13:06,010 --> 00:13:08,850
page but that's the angle that the whole
thing is stuck down at yeah I'm happy

402
00:13:08,850 --> 00:13:08,860
thing is stuck down at yeah I'm happy

403
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:09,570
thing is stuck down at yeah I'm happy
with that

404
00:13:09,570 --> 00:13:09,580
with that

405
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:10,950
with that
you know it's slightly different from

406
00:13:10,950 --> 00:13:10,960
you know it's slightly different from

407
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:14,220
you know it's slightly different from
hero's version but quite a nice opening

408
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:14,230
hero's version but quite a nice opening

409
00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:15,490
hero's version but quite a nice opening
flower

410
00:13:15,490 --> 00:13:15,500
flower

411
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:31,170
