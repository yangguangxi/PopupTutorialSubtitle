00:00:33,929 --> 00:00:36,869
this tutorial is about open top shapes

2
00:00:36,869 --> 00:00:36,879
this tutorial is about open top shapes

3
00:00:36,879 --> 00:00:40,130
this tutorial is about open top shapes
there are a number of configurations so

4
00:00:40,130 --> 00:00:40,140
there are a number of configurations so

5
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:43,079
there are a number of configurations so
this is the most the most basic it's

6
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:43,089
this is the most the most basic it's

7
00:00:43,089 --> 00:00:45,509
this is the most the most basic it's
based on a parallel fold stuck down here

8
00:00:45,509 --> 00:00:45,519
based on a parallel fold stuck down here

9
00:00:45,519 --> 00:00:48,540
based on a parallel fold stuck down here
and here this sister fold at the T chain

10
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:48,550
and here this sister fold at the T chain

11
00:00:48,550 --> 00:00:50,819
and here this sister fold at the T chain
it's really just the strip of card with

12
00:00:50,819 --> 00:00:50,829
it's really just the strip of card with

13
00:00:50,829 --> 00:00:53,039
it's really just the strip of card with
a tab on one end gluing it into a loop

14
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:53,049
a tab on one end gluing it into a loop

15
00:00:53,049 --> 00:01:00,449
a tab on one end gluing it into a loop
and then stuck down next example in this

16
00:01:00,449 --> 00:01:00,459
and then stuck down next example in this

17
00:01:00,459 --> 00:01:02,819
and then stuck down next example in this
case it's the same thing it's a strip of

18
00:01:02,819 --> 00:01:02,829
case it's the same thing it's a strip of

19
00:01:02,829 --> 00:01:05,189
case it's the same thing it's a strip of
card with a tab at one end gluing it

20
00:01:05,189 --> 00:01:05,199
card with a tab at one end gluing it

21
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:08,819
card with a tab at one end gluing it
into a loop but in this case the tabs

22
00:01:08,819 --> 00:01:08,829
into a loop but in this case the tabs

23
00:01:08,829 --> 00:01:10,859
into a loop but in this case the tabs
that attach it to the page run the hole

24
00:01:10,859 --> 00:01:10,869
that attach it to the page run the hole

25
00:01:10,869 --> 00:01:13,260
that attach it to the page run the hole
of each side and then there's a crease

26
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:13,270
of each side and then there's a crease

27
00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:15,029
of each side and then there's a crease
above each corner and then you need

28
00:01:15,029 --> 00:01:15,039
above each corner and then you need

29
00:01:15,039 --> 00:01:17,580
above each corner and then you need
another crease two creases above the

30
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:17,590
another crease two creases above the

31
00:01:17,590 --> 00:01:25,349
another crease two creases above the
base fold so that's that one this is a

32
00:01:25,349 --> 00:01:25,359
base fold so that's that one this is a

33
00:01:25,359 --> 00:01:27,569
base fold so that's that one this is a
similar idea this is a square but in

34
00:01:27,569 --> 00:01:27,579
similar idea this is a square but in

35
00:01:27,579 --> 00:01:30,690
similar idea this is a square but in
this case this is based on a v-fold

36
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:30,700
this case this is based on a v-fold

37
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:33,319
this case this is based on a v-fold
so it's a v-fold lifting a parallelogram

38
00:01:33,319 --> 00:01:33,329
so it's a v-fold lifting a parallelogram

39
00:01:33,329 --> 00:01:37,279
so it's a v-fold lifting a parallelogram
whereas this one we just looked at

40
00:01:37,279 --> 00:01:37,289
whereas this one we just looked at

41
00:01:37,289 --> 00:01:41,149
whereas this one we just looked at
although it's square

42
00:01:41,149 --> 00:01:41,159


43
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:43,889
this one is based on parallel folds not

44
00:01:43,889 --> 00:01:43,899
this one is based on parallel folds not

45
00:01:43,899 --> 00:01:49,859
this one is based on parallel folds not
refunds this one this again this is

46
00:01:49,859 --> 00:01:49,869
refunds this one this again this is

47
00:01:49,869 --> 00:01:52,410
refunds this one this again this is
based on v folds but there's one crease

48
00:01:52,410 --> 00:01:52,420
based on v folds but there's one crease

49
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:54,870
based on v folds but there's one crease
where the v sticks to the page and

50
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:54,880
where the v sticks to the page and

51
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,789
where the v sticks to the page and
another at the other end is still just a

52
00:01:56,789 --> 00:01:56,799
another at the other end is still just a

53
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:59,279
another at the other end is still just a
loop of card with one tab holding it

54
00:01:59,279 --> 00:01:59,289
loop of card with one tab holding it

55
00:01:59,289 --> 00:02:04,739
loop of card with one tab holding it
together then we get more interesting in

56
00:02:04,739 --> 00:02:04,749
together then we get more interesting in

57
00:02:04,749 --> 00:02:06,779
together then we get more interesting in
this case we start getting tapered shape

58
00:02:06,779 --> 00:02:06,789
this case we start getting tapered shape

59
00:02:06,789 --> 00:02:09,480
this case we start getting tapered shape
so for these you will need a compass to

60
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:09,490
so for these you will need a compass to

61
00:02:09,490 --> 00:02:11,820
so for these you will need a compass to
draw the draw the basic pattern

62
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:11,830
draw the draw the basic pattern

63
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:14,700
draw the draw the basic pattern
the net so you can make this type the

64
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:14,710
the net so you can make this type the

65
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:18,720
the net so you can make this type the
like a volcano shape you can also make

66
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:18,730
like a volcano shape you can also make

67
00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:21,570
like a volcano shape you can also make
this type it's like a funnel shape and

68
00:02:21,570 --> 00:02:21,580
this type it's like a funnel shape and

69
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:23,700
this type it's like a funnel shape and
this lends itself to being turned into

70
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:23,710
this lends itself to being turned into

71
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:27,650
this lends itself to being turned into
flowers so here we have an example of a

72
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:27,660
flowers so here we have an example of a

73
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:31,140
flowers so here we have an example of a
flower design so we've got two layers of

74
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:31,150
flower design so we've got two layers of

75
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:33,870
flower design so we've got two layers of
petals and then we've got a pyramid in

76
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:33,880
petals and then we've got a pyramid in

77
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:35,880
petals and then we've got a pyramid in
the middle that the pyramid design will

78
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:35,890
the middle that the pyramid design will

79
00:02:35,890 --> 00:02:40,620
the middle that the pyramid design will
explain in tutorial 21 all that the

80
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:40,630
explain in tutorial 21 all that the

81
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:42,480
explain in tutorial 21 all that the
planes there are actually six planes

82
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:42,490
planes there are actually six planes

83
00:02:42,490 --> 00:02:44,850
planes there are actually six planes
that are lifted so you can add pieces to

84
00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:44,860
that are lifted so you can add pieces to

85
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:46,800
that are lifted so you can add pieces to
any of those there's also gullies

86
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:46,810
any of those there's also gullies

87
00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:49,320
any of those there's also gullies
created where where it's glued to the

88
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:49,330
created where where it's glued to the

89
00:02:49,330 --> 00:02:52,560
created where where it's glued to the
page this is glued down parallel folds

90
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:52,570
page this is glued down parallel folds

91
00:02:52,570 --> 00:02:54,720
page this is glued down parallel folds
so that there's two sticking places

92
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:54,730
so that there's two sticking places

93
00:02:54,730 --> 00:02:56,850
so that there's two sticking places
parallel to the spine and so where they

94
00:02:56,850 --> 00:02:56,860
parallel to the spine and so where they

95
00:02:56,860 --> 00:02:59,160
parallel to the spine and so where they
glue down you create a gully that you

96
00:02:59,160 --> 00:02:59,170
glue down you create a gully that you

97
00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:02,270
glue down you create a gully that you
can build into so here's another example

98
00:03:02,270 --> 00:03:02,280
can build into so here's another example

99
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:05,310
can build into so here's another example
this is a basic flower with a pyramid

100
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:05,320
this is a basic flower with a pyramid

101
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:07,920
this is a basic flower with a pyramid
type mechanism in the middle and then

102
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:07,930
type mechanism in the middle and then

103
00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:11,640
type mechanism in the middle and then
this is a counter folded piece load into

104
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:11,650
this is a counter folded piece load into

105
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:12,150
this is a counter folded piece load into
the gully

106
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:12,160
the gully

107
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:14,910
the gully
so as you open rather than just being a

108
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:14,920
so as you open rather than just being a

109
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:17,100
so as you open rather than just being a
straight piece like this one we've got a

110
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:17,110
straight piece like this one we've got a

111
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:25,280
straight piece like this one we've got a
piece that lifts up three dimensionally

112
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:25,290


113
00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:28,979
so we just make a really basic open top

114
00:03:28,979 --> 00:03:28,989
so we just make a really basic open top

115
00:03:28,989 --> 00:03:32,310
so we just make a really basic open top
shapes just a loop glued together so

116
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:32,320
shapes just a loop glued together so

117
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:35,150
shapes just a loop glued together so
take a base sheet use your base sheets

118
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:35,160
take a base sheet use your base sheets

119
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:38,160
take a base sheet use your base sheets
so just cut yourself a strip of card

120
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:38,170
so just cut yourself a strip of card

121
00:03:38,170 --> 00:03:46,330
so just cut yourself a strip of card
right long

122
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:46,340


123
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:51,830
folder gluing tab onto one end fold it

124
00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:51,840
folder gluing tab onto one end fold it

125
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,650
folder gluing tab onto one end fold it
well now you bring the other end round

126
00:03:54,650 --> 00:03:54,660
well now you bring the other end round

127
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:57,140
well now you bring the other end round
and you can just glue that on glue it

128
00:03:57,140 --> 00:03:57,150
and you can just glue that on glue it

129
00:03:57,150 --> 00:03:58,520
and you can just glue that on glue it
shut you might want it underneath

130
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:58,530
shut you might want it underneath

131
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:01,700
shut you might want it underneath
doesn't really matter anyway glue on

132
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:01,710
doesn't really matter anyway glue on

133
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:13,910
doesn't really matter anyway glue on
that so we glue that into a loop and

134
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:13,920
that so we glue that into a loop and

135
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:17,060
that so we glue that into a loop and
then you crush it flat because you will

136
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:17,070
then you crush it flat because you will

137
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:19,760
then you crush it flat because you will
need a that you need it to be like this

138
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:19,770
need a that you need it to be like this

139
00:04:19,770 --> 00:04:23,050
need a that you need it to be like this
so this will open up like this folder a

140
00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:23,060
so this will open up like this folder a

141
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:25,580
so this will open up like this folder a
gluing you know file tabs on to the

142
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:25,590
gluing you know file tabs on to the

143
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:27,530
gluing you know file tabs on to the
bottom of it so all the way along one

144
00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:27,540
bottom of it so all the way along one

145
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:30,640
bottom of it so all the way along one
sides you just make a big long crease

146
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:30,650
sides you just make a big long crease

147
00:04:30,650 --> 00:04:36,530
sides you just make a big long crease
fold it back on itself and now you you

148
00:04:36,530 --> 00:04:36,540
fold it back on itself and now you you

149
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:38,330
fold it back on itself and now you you
just want a tab left in the middle of

150
00:04:38,330 --> 00:04:38,340
just want a tab left in the middle of

151
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:40,670
just want a tab left in the middle of
each side so you can just cut along that

152
00:04:40,670 --> 00:04:40,680
each side so you can just cut along that

153
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:41,890
each side so you can just cut along that
crease

154
00:04:41,890 --> 00:04:41,900
crease

155
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:45,490
crease
and just leave a section in the middle

156
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:45,500
and just leave a section in the middle

157
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:54,670
and just leave a section in the middle
just for a little gluing tab

158
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:54,680


159
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:58,840
so here it is this is the loop with two

160
00:04:58,840 --> 00:04:58,850
so here it is this is the loop with two

161
00:04:58,850 --> 00:05:03,150
so here it is this is the loop with two
tabs on it make sure they work nicely

162
00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:03,160
tabs on it make sure they work nicely

163
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:09,520
tabs on it make sure they work nicely
take your base see how why do you want

164
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:09,530
take your base see how why do you want

165
00:05:09,530 --> 00:05:11,499
take your base see how why do you want
it watch what sort of shakes you want

166
00:05:11,499 --> 00:05:11,509

it will take quite a lot of stress so

188
00:05:57,430 --> 00:05:57,440
it will take quite a lot of stress so

189
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:00,029
it will take quite a lot of stress so
make sure you give it a chance for the

190
00:06:00,029 --> 00:06:00,039
make sure you give it a chance for the

191
00:06:00,039 --> 00:06:06,969
make sure you give it a chance for the
glue to go off and there it is you'll

192
00:06:06,969 --> 00:06:06,979
glue to go off and there it is you'll

193
00:06:06,979 --> 00:06:08,740
glue to go off and there it is you'll
find wear as long as it's quite the

194
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:08,750
find wear as long as it's quite the

195
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:11,200
find wear as long as it's quite the
walls are quite short it's fine but the

196
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:11,210
walls are quite short it's fine but the

197
00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:13,180
walls are quite short it's fine but the
higher you go the more they will tend to

198
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:13,190
higher you go the more they will tend to

199
00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:16,719
higher you go the more they will tend to
to lean in the bend of the card starts

200
00:06:16,719 --> 00:06:16,729
to lean in the bend of the card starts

201
00:06:16,729 --> 00:06:24,330

influencing the shape I'll now make a

202
00:06:24,330 --> 00:06:24,340
influencing the shape I'll now make a

203
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:27,640
influencing the shape I'll now make a
flower type design so that is a tapered

204
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:27,650
flower type design so that is a tapered

205
00:06:27,650 --> 00:06:29,409
flower type design so that is a tapered
shape so for that yeah you will need

206
00:06:29,409 --> 00:06:29,419
shape so for that yeah you will need

207
00:06:29,419 --> 00:06:34,510
shape so for that yeah you will need
your compass so start with a base sheet

208
00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:34,520
your compass so start with a base sheet

209
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:38,350

now take a piece of card and let's go

214
00:06:47,770 --> 00:06:47,780
now take a piece of card and let's go

215
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:54,490
now take a piece of card and let's go
for a yellow one and put your compass on

216
00:06:54,490 --> 00:06:54,500
for a yellow one and put your compass on

217
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:58,810
for a yellow one and put your compass on
one one side and you need to draw as big

218
00:06:58,810 --> 00:06:58,820
one one side and you need to draw as big

219
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:01,420
one one side and you need to draw as big
an arc as you can the way this works

220
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:01,430
an arc as you can the way this works

221
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:05,529
an arc as you can the way this works
that the flat of the arc the more the

222
00:07:05,529 --> 00:07:05,539
that the flat of the arc the more the

223
00:07:05,539 --> 00:07:07,290
that the flat of the arc the more the
petals will stand up

224
00:07:07,290 --> 00:07:07,300
petals will stand up

225
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:09,960
petals will stand up
the tighter the ark the more they will

226
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:09,970
the tighter the ark the more they will

227
00:07:09,970 --> 00:07:12,930
the tighter the ark the more they will
lie down if you take a if you take a

228
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:12,940
lie down if you take a if you take a

229
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:14,969
lie down if you take a if you take a
circle and just break it into six

230
00:07:14,969 --> 00:07:14,979
circle and just break it into six

231
00:07:14,979 --> 00:07:17,820
circle and just break it into six
sections equal sections that will be

232
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:17,830
sections equal sections that will be

233
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:20,339
sections equal sections that will be
flat like this thing we just made that

234
00:07:20,339 --> 00:07:20,349
flat like this thing we just made that

235
00:07:20,349 --> 00:07:22,740
flat like this thing we just made that
in effect was a completely flattened out

236
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:22,750
in effect was a completely flattened out

237
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:25,170
in effect was a completely flattened out
art it was strength and so now we're

238
00:07:25,170 --> 00:07:25,180
art it was strength and so now we're

239
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:27,659
art it was strength and so now we're
going as wide as we can

240
00:07:27,659 --> 00:07:27,669
going as wide as we can

241
00:07:27,669 --> 00:07:30,180
going as wide as we can
so with this compass this is the widest

242
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:30,190
so with this compass this is the widest

243
00:07:30,190 --> 00:07:35,760
so with this compass this is the widest
it'll open so do a big arc and then

244
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:35,770
it'll open so do a big arc and then

245
00:07:35,770 --> 00:07:38,490
it'll open so do a big arc and then
decide how tall you want the petals to

246
00:07:38,490 --> 00:07:38,500
decide how tall you want the petals to

247
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:41,100
decide how tall you want the petals to
be so I just move it in randomly really

248
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:41,110
be so I just move it in randomly really

249
00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:48,749
be so I just move it in randomly really
and draw another another RMS and then

250
00:07:48,749 --> 00:07:48,759
and draw another another RMS and then

251
00:07:48,759 --> 00:07:51,060
and draw another another RMS and then
mark the center point where the point of

252
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:51,070
mark the center point where the point of

253
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:53,360
mark the center point where the point of
the compass is that's quite important so

254
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:53,370
the compass is that's quite important so

255
00:07:53,370 --> 00:07:58,050
the compass is that's quite important so
there is and now change the diameter

256
00:07:58,050 --> 00:07:58,060
there is and now change the diameter

257
00:07:58,060 --> 00:08:00,659
there is and now change the diameter
change the gap between the pencil point

258
00:08:00,659 --> 00:08:00,669
change the gap between the pencil point

259
00:08:00,669 --> 00:08:02,879
change the gap between the pencil point
and the point you don't want it to be

260
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:02,889
and the point you don't want it to be

261
00:08:02,889 --> 00:08:05,640
and the point you don't want it to be
the same as well as the radius of this

262
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:05,650
the same as well as the radius of this

263
00:08:05,650 --> 00:08:09,839
the same as well as the radius of this
this arc is so I'm going for what's it

264
00:08:09,839 --> 00:08:09,849
this arc is so I'm going for what's it

265
00:08:09,849 --> 00:08:13,370
this arc is so I'm going for what's it
son four four centimeters roughly and

266
00:08:13,370 --> 00:08:13,380
son four four centimeters roughly and

267
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:17,939
son four four centimeters roughly and
just measure off start with one point

268
00:08:17,939 --> 00:08:17,949
just measure off start with one point

269
00:08:17,949 --> 00:08:20,490
just measure off start with one point
and just measure off six sections it's

270
00:08:20,490 --> 00:08:20,500
and just measure off six sections it's

271
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,860
and just measure off six sections it's
really important that you do six so

272
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:22,870
really important that you do six so

273
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:35,690
really important that you do six so
there's one two three four five

274
00:08:35,690 --> 00:08:35,700


275
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:40,670
six okay now you need your scoring

276
00:08:40,670 --> 00:08:40,680
six okay now you need your scoring

277
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:44,960
six okay now you need your scoring
implement I'm using a biro and you just

278
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:44,970
implement I'm using a biro and you just

279
00:08:44,970 --> 00:08:48,320
implement I'm using a biro and you just
score lines from the center point where

280
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:48,330
score lines from the center point where

281
00:08:48,330 --> 00:08:52,100
score lines from the center point where
your compass point was put it on the

282
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:52,110
your compass point was put it on the

283
00:08:52,110 --> 00:08:54,410
your compass point was put it on the
mark you made with the compass and just

284
00:08:54,410 --> 00:08:54,420
mark you made with the compass and just

285
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:57,710
mark you made with the compass and just
score across between the two the two

286
00:08:57,710 --> 00:08:57,720
score across between the two the two

287
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:30,120
score across between the two the two
parallel arcs

288
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:30,130


289
00:09:30,130 --> 00:09:33,340
okay and now you will need tabs on the

290
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:33,350
okay and now you will need tabs on the

291
00:09:33,350 --> 00:09:36,670
okay and now you will need tabs on the
inside that will stick it to the page so

292
00:09:36,670 --> 00:09:36,680
inside that will stick it to the page so

293
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:40,360
inside that will stick it to the page so
score a line between two and then this

294
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:40,370
score a line between two and then this

295
00:09:40,370 --> 00:09:43,540
score a line between two and then this
is the important thing you this one is

296
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:43,550
is the important thing you this one is

297
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:45,370
is the important thing you this one is
going to stick to the page then you

298
00:09:45,370 --> 00:09:45,380
going to stick to the page then you

299
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:47,710
going to stick to the page then you
leave two blank and then you score

300
00:09:47,710 --> 00:09:47,720
leave two blank and then you score

301
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:49,120
leave two blank and then you score
another line where there's going to be

302
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:49,130
another line where there's going to be

303
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:55,380
another line where there's going to be
another tab and finally don't forget the

304
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:55,390
another tab and finally don't forget the

305
00:09:55,390 --> 00:09:57,610
another tab and finally don't forget the
final tab the tab that's going to pull

306
00:09:57,610 --> 00:09:57,620
final tab the tab that's going to pull

307
00:09:57,620 --> 00:09:59,320
final tab the tab that's going to pull
the whole thing into a loop that needs

308
00:09:59,320 --> 00:09:59,330
the whole thing into a loop that needs

309
00:09:59,330 --> 00:10:02,500
the whole thing into a loop that needs
to be marked on one end I'm going to do

310
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:02,510
to be marked on one end I'm going to do

311
00:10:02,510 --> 00:10:04,990
to be marked on one end I'm going to do
it on this end where I can see the the

312
00:10:04,990 --> 00:10:05,000
it on this end where I can see the the

313
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,800
it on this end where I can see the the
guidelines this is the time if you want

314
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:08,810
guidelines this is the time if you want

315
00:10:08,810 --> 00:10:11,110
guidelines this is the time if you want
your petals to be shape this is your

316
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:11,120
your petals to be shape this is your

317
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:13,200
your petals to be shape this is your
opportunity whether you want them

318
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:13,210
opportunity whether you want them

319
00:10:13,210 --> 00:10:16,120
opportunity whether you want them
pointed rounded you know something more

320
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:16,130
pointed rounded you know something more

321
00:10:16,130 --> 00:10:18,310
pointed rounded you know something more
interesting is this is the moment to do

322
00:10:18,310 --> 00:10:18,320
interesting is this is the moment to do

323
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:21,160
interesting is this is the moment to do
it so yet we'll just go for something

324
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:21,170
it so yet we'll just go for something

325
00:10:21,170 --> 00:10:49,120
it so yet we'll just go for something
fairly basic here now cut it out

326
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:49,130


327
00:10:49,130 --> 00:10:52,520
so make sure you have this these two

328
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:52,530
so make sure you have this these two

329
00:10:52,530 --> 00:10:54,800
so make sure you have this these two
tabs on the inside that are going to

330
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:54,810
tabs on the inside that are going to

331
00:10:54,810 --> 00:11:11,910
tabs on the inside that are going to
glue it to the page

332
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:11,920


333
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:17,680
okay here it is so freeze all the score

334
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:17,690
okay here it is so freeze all the score

335
00:11:17,690 --> 00:11:22,570
okay here it is so freeze all the score
lines between the petals fold them all

336
00:11:22,570 --> 00:11:22,580
lines between the petals fold them all

337
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:25,650
lines between the petals fold them all
one way and then back on themselves

338
00:11:25,650 --> 00:11:25,660
one way and then back on themselves

339
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:30,280
one way and then back on themselves
don't forget to fold order all the tabs

340
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:30,290
don't forget to fold order all the tabs

341
00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:35,620
don't forget to fold order all the tabs
as well the three tabs so now you glue

342
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:35,630
as well the three tabs so now you glue

343
00:11:35,630 --> 00:11:38,920
as well the three tabs so now you glue
it into a loop but in this case make

344
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:38,930
it into a loop but in this case make

345
00:11:38,930 --> 00:11:41,020
it into a loop but in this case make
sure you keep the guidelines on the

346
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:41,030
sure you keep the guidelines on the

347
00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:43,330
sure you keep the guidelines on the
underneath so turn it around like that

348
00:11:43,330 --> 00:11:43,340
underneath so turn it around like that

349
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:47,290
underneath so turn it around like that
so you've got a clean surface showing

350
00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:47,300
so you've got a clean surface showing

351
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:50,890
so you've got a clean surface showing
and then you glue that and we're going

352
00:11:50,890 --> 00:11:50,900
and then you glue that and we're going

353
00:11:50,900 --> 00:12:08,330
and then you glue that and we're going
to glue it behind then we are

354
00:12:08,330 --> 00:12:08,340


355
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:10,790
so that's your basic flower shape and

356
00:12:10,790 --> 00:12:10,800
so that's your basic flower shape and

357
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:13,040
so that's your basic flower shape and
then you need to line it up on their

358
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:13,050
then you need to line it up on their

359
00:12:13,050 --> 00:12:15,920
then you need to line it up on their
face taps again you can have them going

360
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:15,930
face taps again you can have them going

361
00:12:15,930 --> 00:12:18,860
face taps again you can have them going
inside or outside if you're going to

362
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:18,870
inside or outside if you're going to

363
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:23,210
inside or outside if you're going to
make it like this one then the the tabs

364
00:12:23,210 --> 00:12:23,220
make it like this one then the the tabs

365
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:24,800
make it like this one then the the tabs
are all on the inside and they're all

366
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:24,810
are all on the inside and they're all

367
00:12:24,810 --> 00:12:28,280
are all on the inside and they're all
all hidden underneath it if you're not

368
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:28,290
all hidden underneath it if you're not

369
00:12:28,290 --> 00:12:29,120
all hidden underneath it if you're not
going to build anymore

370
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:29,130
going to build anymore

371
00:12:29,130 --> 00:12:31,490
going to build anymore
you might be better off having the tabs

372
00:12:31,490 --> 00:12:31,500
you might be better off having the tabs

373
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:34,100
you might be better off having the tabs
on the outside so so they're just hidden

374
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:34,110
on the outside so so they're just hidden

375
00:12:34,110 --> 00:12:36,890
on the outside so so they're just hidden
underneath the lean of the petals and

376
00:12:36,890 --> 00:12:36,900
underneath the lean of the petals and

377
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:40,250
underneath the lean of the petals and
then make sure these these creases are

378
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:40,260
then make sure these these creases are

379
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:42,800
then make sure these these creases are
above the spine fold and then you can

380
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:42,810
above the spine fold and then you can

381
00:12:42,810 --> 00:12:50,600
above the spine fold and then you can
glue glue down one side so get it as

382
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:50,610
glue glue down one side so get it as

383
00:12:50,610 --> 00:12:52,610
glue glue down one side so get it as
round as you can get it

384
00:12:52,610 --> 00:12:52,620
round as you can get it

385
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:55,070

00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:50,620
so so these are really if you are making
a flower but instead of putting the tabs

490
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:50,630
a flower but instead of putting the tabs

491
00:15:50,630 --> 00:15:53,500
a flower but instead of putting the tabs
