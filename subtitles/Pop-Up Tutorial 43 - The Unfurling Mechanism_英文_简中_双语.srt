本教程是关于展开

3
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:39,380
this tutorial is about the unfurling
机制，这是一个非常不寻常的小

4
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:39,390
this tutorial is about the unfurling
我从这本书中学到的机制

5
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:42,440
this tutorial is about the unfurling
mechanism it's a quite an unusual little
大卫·佩洛姆（David Pellom）真的叫乌鸦（Raven）

6
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:42,450
mechanism it's a quite an unusual little
很棒但是很漂亮

7
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:45,640
mechanism it's a quite an unusual little
mechanism that I took from this book by
插图和非常聪明的弹出式窗口

8
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:45,650
mechanism that I took from this book by
我将贯穿整个过程，以便您看到

9
00:00:45,650 --> 00:00:49,070
mechanism that I took from this book by
David Pellom called the Raven really
到底有多伟大

10
00:00:49,070 --> 00:00:49,080
David Pellom called the Raven really
我将在下面解释展开机制

11
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:50,840
David Pellom called the Raven really
fantastic but really beautiful
最终这些是点差，所以这是

12
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:50,850
fantastic but really beautiful
展开机制，这是一个

13
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:53,810
fantastic but really beautiful
illustration and very clever pop-ups so
我将在本教程中进行解释

14
00:00:53,810 --> 00:00:53,820
illustration and very clever pop-ups so
然后这是本书的结尾

15
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:55,880
illustration and very clever pop-ups so
I'll just run through it so you can see
这是我认为的展开机制

16
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:55,890
I'll just run through it so you can see
理解它的最好方法是看

17
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:59,180
I'll just run through it so you can see
just how great it is really and then
从后面看，您会看到

18
00:00:59,180 --> 00:00:59,190
just how great it is really and then
整个事物由v形折叠驱动

19
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:02,180
just how great it is really and then
I'll explain the unfurling mechanism at
在这里，v形是

20
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:02,190
I'll explain the unfurling mechanism at
v折，v折上的角度

21
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:15,380
I'll explain the unfurling mechanism at
the end these are the spreads so this is
与页面上的角度相同

22
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:15,390
the end these are the spreads so this is
因此，当页面平坦时，v形折叠位于

23
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:17,300
the end these are the spreads so this is
the unfolding mechanism this is the one
平v形折叠向上并

24
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:17,310
the unfolding mechanism this is the one
有一块推向后

25
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:19,670
the unfolding mechanism this is the one
I'm going to explain in this tutorial
最容易向您展示的手指

26
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:19,680
I'm going to explain in this tutorial
我做了这个，所以我把它

27
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:23,740
I'm going to explain in this tutorial
and then this is the end of the book
在那里，这是V故障

28
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:23,750
and then this is the end of the book
这将是手的前面

29
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:27,260
and then this is the end of the book
this is the unfurling mechanism I think
是向上推手指的那一块

30
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:27,270
this is the unfurling mechanism I think
它在这里向后推，

31
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:30,260
this is the unfurling mechanism I think
the best way to understand it is to look
手指实际上是铰接在顶部

32
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:30,270
the best way to understand it is to look
V形折叠的延伸部分

33
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:33,260
the best way to understand it is to look
at it from behind you'll see that the
打开和关闭，您可以看到

34
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:33,270
at it from behind you'll see that the
在书中工作而不是仅仅

35
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:37,550
at it from behind you'll see that the
whole thing is powered by a v-fold in
像我一样在这里变黄

36
00:01:37,550 --> 00:01:37,560
whole thing is powered by a v-fold in
做了一系列不同的

37
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:40,250
whole thing is powered by a v-fold in
here and the v-fold is the type of
不同手指的高度，如果

38
00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:40,260
here and the v-fold is the type of
我们从侧面看它，这里有一个

39
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:42,170
here and the v-fold is the type of
v-fold where the angles on the v-fold
所有人都有很多不同的身高

40
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:42,180
v-fold where the angles on the v-fold
不同的形状，但都被向上推

41
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:44,270
v-fold where the angles on the v-fold
are the same as the angles on the page
推动这一切的一切

42
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:44,280
are the same as the angles on the page
这些不同的水平和一块

43
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:47,810
are the same as the angles on the page
so when the page is flat the v-fold lies
它所反对的是不同的

44
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:47,820
so when the page is flat the v-fold lies
水平，所以当你看着它会

45
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:50,300
so when the page is flat the v-fold lies
flat the v-fold is extended up and
真的是黄色的东西

46
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:50,310
flat the v-fold is extended up and
不同级别，还有红色

47
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:52,399
flat the v-fold is extended up and
there's a piece that pushes up the back
会有不同的水平，但我已经

48
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:52,409
there's a piece that pushes up the back
只是说清楚一点，所以你

49
00:01:52,409 --> 00:01:55,250
there's a piece that pushes up the back
of the fingers easiest to show you on
可以理解，所以我现在做一个

50
00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:55,260
of the fingers easiest to show you on
我已经把所有的东西都剪了

51
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:58,310
of the fingers easiest to show you on
this one that I've made so I'll put that
所以我会解释给他们看

52
00:01:58,310 --> 00:01:58,320
this one that I've made so I'll put that
很简单，这是基础表

53
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:03,760
this one that I've made so I'll put that
there so here it is this is the V fault
完全对折

54
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:03,770
there so here it is this is the V fault
这是这两个角度的V折

55
00:02:03,770 --> 00:02:06,980
there so here it is this is the V fault
this would be the front of the hand this
45度增加了，我会的

56
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:06,990
this would be the front of the hand this
现在就折一下，折起来

57
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:09,139
this would be the front of the hand this
is the piece that pushes up the fingers
你真的很认真地看着这个

58
00:02:09,139 --> 00:02:09,149
is the piece that pushes up the fingers
可以看到它在

59
00:02:09,149 --> 00:02:13,240
is the piece that pushes up the fingers
it pushes up at the back here and the
页面，以便将成为V

60
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:13,250
it pushes up at the back here and the
它会在页面顶部附近

61
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:15,610
it pushes up at the back here and the
the finger is actually hinged on the top
指向这样的东西

62
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:15,620
the finger is actually hinged on the top
没错，所以我就把

63
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:18,310
the finger is actually hinged on the top
of this extension to the v-fold so as it
粘在那里，因为它是平坦的

64
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:18,320
of this extension to the v-fold so as it
弹出式窗口是扁平的，可以将两面都粘上

65
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:21,880
of this extension to the v-fold so as it
opens and closes you can see how that
与此同时

66
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:21,890
opens and closes you can see how that
我将其放置在此处，确保

67
00:02:21,890 --> 00:02:27,250
opens and closes you can see how that
works in the book rather than to just
弹出窗口的中央折痕对齐

68
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:27,260
works in the book rather than to just
与基地的中央折痕

69
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:29,830
works in the book rather than to just
being one flat level here yellow as I've
粘下来折叠起来只是为了使

70
00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:29,840
being one flat level here yellow as I've
确保一切顺利

71
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,510
being one flat level here yellow as I've
made there's a whole series of different
哦耶

72
00:02:31,510 --> 00:02:31,520
made there's a whole series of different
所以现在你会看到这块黄色的

73
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:34,900
made there's a whole series of different
heights for the different fingers so if
粘在v形折叠的一侧，所以

74
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:34,910
heights for the different fingers so if
这是我要添加的黄色部分

75
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:37,690
heights for the different fingers so if
we look at it sideways on here there's a
上，你会看到那黄色

76
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:37,700
we look at it sideways on here there's a
件粘在v形折叠的一侧

77
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:40,210
we look at it sideways on here there's a
whole lot of different heights to all
所以这是一块那么低的黄色

78
00:02:40,210 --> 00:02:40,220
whole lot of different heights to all
黄片，将被粘上

79
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:42,070
whole lot of different heights to all
different shapes but all pushed up by
在V形折叠的这一侧，请确保

80
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:42,080
different shapes but all pushed up by
角落就在角落里，否则

81
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:45,310
different shapes but all pushed up by
the the piece that's pushing it has all
好吧，它显然不会关闭

82
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:45,320
the the piece that's pushing it has all
正确地在这上面放一些胶水

83
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:47,470
the the piece that's pushing it has all
these different levels and the piece
这里的三角形那里胶太多

84
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:47,480
these different levels and the piece
我待会儿干

85
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:49,720
these different levels and the piece
that it's pushing against has different
我将其关闭以确保其正常工作，

86
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:49,730
that it's pushing against has different
现在给第二分钟

87
00:02:49,730 --> 00:02:51,880
that it's pushing against has different
levels so when you look at this it would
这是一块带有插槽的零件

88
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:51,890
levels so when you look at this it would
那红色的碎片穿过

89
00:02:51,890 --> 00:02:54,400
levels so when you look at this it would
be really the yellow piece would have
这将继续在这里插槽是

90
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:54,410
be really the yellow piece would have
刚好高于这里的水平

91
00:02:54,410 --> 00:02:57,130
be really the yellow piece would have
different levels and also the red piece
你可能会把它全部

92
00:02:57,130 --> 00:02:57,140
different levels and also the red piece
一张卡，但我认为它也相当

93
00:02:57,140 --> 00:02:58,810
different levels and also the red piece
would have different levels but I've
保持坚韧很好，这是几个

94
00:02:58,810 --> 00:02:58,820
would have different levels but I've
厚度，所以我已经标记了插槽

95
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:01,750
would have different levels but I've
just made one to make it clear so you
将与折痕平行

96
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:01,760
just made one to make it clear so you
我刚刚把它切掉了

97
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,350
just made one to make it clear so you
can understand it so now I'll make one
好的

98
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:04,360
can understand it so now I'll make one
荡妇需要在顶部上方

99
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:07,510
can understand it so now I'll make one
I've cut out all the pieces in advance
边缘，我将其粘在上面

100
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:07,520
I've cut out all the pieces in advance
好吧，我将其关闭

101
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,949
I've cut out all the pieces in advance
so I'll explain them all they're all
确保一切正常，这显然是一个

102
00:03:08,949 --> 00:03:08,959
so I'll explain them all they're all
假人，你可以看到它伸出

103
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:12,270
so I'll explain them all they're all
quite simple this is the base sheet
边缘，但没关系，这只是

104
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:12,280
quite simple this is the base sheet
解释机制，所以我们

105
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:17,460
quite simple this is the base sheet
folded in half folded really thoroughly
现在是那样移动吗红色

106


一块，这将推高

107
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:21,250
this is the V fold both these angles are
整个东西实际上就是

108
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:21,260
this is the V fold both these angles are
移动方式的机制

109
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:24,699
this is the V fold both these angles are
45 degrees I have increased it yes I'll
这是我做的地带

110
00:03:24,699 --> 00:03:24,709
45 degrees I have increased it yes I'll
压下中间，我要粘

111
00:03:24,709 --> 00:03:30,070
45 degrees I have increased it yes I'll
just crease that now so that crease
一分钟

112
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:30,080
just crease that now so that crease
但是首先我们要在其中一个

113
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:33,610
just crease that now so that crease
really thoroughly you look at this you
结束，所以我要在那儿剪一点

114
00:03:33,610 --> 00:03:33,620
really thoroughly you look at this you
所以这将是一个选项卡

115
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:36,340
really thoroughly you look at this you
can see where it's positioned on the
现在将其粘贴到页面上

116
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:36,350
can see where it's positioned on the
此时，您会看到在

117
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:41,920
can see where it's positioned on the
page so that piece is going to be the V
这本书的底部是红色的全部

118
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:41,930
page so that piece is going to be the V
制成一件，但由于

119
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:44,440
page so that piece is going to be the V
it'll be near the top of the page
测量和填充的并发症

120
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:44,450
it'll be near the top of the page
我要用两块做成

121
00:03:44,450 --> 00:03:49,229
it'll be near the top of the page
pointing down it something like this
这件，那件出现的

122
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:49,239
pointing down it something like this
该高度必须与

123
00:03:49,239 --> 00:03:53,500
pointing down it something like this
that's about right so I'll just put the
总黄色，因此现在已进入标签页

124
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:53,510
that's about right so I'll just put the
一方面，我只需要衡量

125
00:03:53,510 --> 00:03:57,699
that's about right so I'll just put the
glue on there and as it's flat when the
高整个事情需要来这个

126
00:03:57,699 --> 00:03:57,709
glue on there and as it's flat when the
时间，所以我将其标记为

127
00:03:57,709 --> 00:03:59,710
glue on there and as it's flat when the
pop-up is flat you can glue both sides
与底部齐平，这是

128
00:03:59,710 --> 00:03:59,720
pop-up is flat you can glue both sides
其他标签将是，所以我要

129
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:06,309
pop-up is flat you can glue both sides
at the same time
切成一个标签，然后切

130


那关

131
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:08,610
I'll position it on there make sure the
对，所以这将是另一个

132
00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:08,620
I'll position it on there make sure the
现在，我可以将双方粘合在一起

133
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:12,819
I'll position it on there make sure the
central crease of the pop-up is
在一起只是为了使其真正强大

134
00:04:12,819 --> 00:04:12,829
central crease of the pop-up is
推杆我们去

135
00:04:12,829 --> 00:04:14,999
central crease of the pop-up is
with the central crease of the base
刚干的时候你在这里看到

136
00:04:14,999 --> 00:04:15,009
with the central crease of the base
因为我用红色做成了

137
00:04:15,009 --> 00:04:18,849
with the central crease of the base
stick it down fold it shut just to make
我放了两根铰链

138
00:04:18,849 --> 00:04:18,859
stick it down fold it shut just to make
黄色的顶部，这样您就可以

139
00:04:18,859 --> 00:04:21,129
stick it down fold it shut just to make
sure that everything is working smoothly
附加所有这就是铰链

140
00:04:21,129 --> 00:04:21,139
sure that everything is working smoothly
只是一小片，里面有折叠

141
00:04:21,139 --> 00:04:24,850
sure that everything is working smoothly
oh yeah
中间需要与

142
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:24,860
