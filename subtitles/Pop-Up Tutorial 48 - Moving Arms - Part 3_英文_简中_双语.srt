again it's from the 1930s when we open
it it's got this rather magnificent
当盒子打开和关闭手臂时

00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:47,509
but the movement of the arms is really
great you look at it from the side again
那将是他的手臂，所以这是一个

great you look at it from the side again
山谷折这是山折这

87
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:50,600

放完就算是山谷褶皱

90
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:53,070
by these folds the way the arms are
在一起这是

91
00:02:53,070 --> 00:02:55,830
by these folds the way the arms are
joined onto the top of the box
看起来像是盒子的顶部

92
00:02:55,830 --> 00:02:55,840
joined onto the top of the box
这是他的手臂要摆动

93
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:58,320
joined onto the top of the box
first of all let me explain the box this
所以当整个传播是

94
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:58,330
first of all let me explain the box this
像这样就关闭了

95
00:02:58,330 --> 00:03:01,559
first of all let me explain the box this
is from tutorial 14 this is the box it
然后当价差打开顶部时

96
00:03:01,559 --> 00:03:01,569
is from tutorial 14 this is the box it
盒子打开，他的手臂向右移动

97
00:03:01,569 --> 00:03:03,570
is from tutorial 14 this is the box it
gives you these two planes that are
再一次，也许我没有说这个

98
00:03:03,570 --> 00:03:03,580
gives you these two planes that are
我在上面涂鸦的地方

99
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:06,180
gives you these two planes that are
parallel with the base it always has to
粘在一起看看这个你可以

100
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:06,190
parallel with the base it always has to
看到那是粘在一起的地方

101
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:07,979
parallel with the base it always has to
have this pillar coming up the middle
你只是再看看这个你

102
00:03:07,979 --> 00:03:07,989
have this pillar coming up the middle
可以看看也许我能绕过这个

103
00:03:07,989 --> 00:03:10,199
have this pillar coming up the middle
which pushes up the center of the lid
您可以看到框顶部的方式是

104
00:03:10,199 --> 00:03:10,209
which pushes up the center of the lid
山谷然后山顶

105
00:03:10,209 --> 00:03:13,350
which pushes up the center of the lid
that gives you a solid base normally the
这是一座山，但是你有

106
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:13,360
that gives you a solid base normally the
在那与那之间的那个山谷

107
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:16,410
that gives you a solid base normally the
box will also need an end on it that is
给你那宏伟的动作

108
00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:16,420
box will also need an end on it that is
所以如果我只是用

109
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:18,720
box will also need an end on it that is
what locks the two sides into a solid
盒机制，让您有个主意

something like the conductor model there
该机制的顶部打开，

115
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:26,789
something like the conductor model there

手臂放下，所以是指挥

116
00:03:26,789 --> 00:03:26,799
are ends on the box that are making it

127
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:45,569
this box but it's still a box shape with
a central pillar pushing up the lids
尾巴出现，所以现在我来解释

128
00:03:45,569 --> 00:03:45,579
a central pillar pushing up the lids
我这里有两个例子

129
00:03:45,579 --> 00:03:47,550
a central pillar pushing up the lids
pushing out the sides giving you a
尾部这是背面

130
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:47,560
pushing out the sides giving you a
当它关闭时是尾巴

131
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:51,809
pushing out the sides giving you a
stable solid life to build these moving
当传播打开尾巴出现我

132
00:03:51,809 --> 00:03:51,819
stable solid life to build these moving
可以在这里展示给你看

133
00:03:51,819 --> 00:03:56,039
stable solid life to build these moving
parts onto so probably the most simple
这是盒子这是尾巴

134
00:03:56,039 --> 00:03:56,049
parts onto so probably the most simple
价差关闭，尾巴向下

135
00:03:56,049 --> 00:04:03,229
parts onto so probably the most simple
to explain is the minuet that's this one
它散开打开尾巴出现

136
00:04:03,229 --> 00:04:03,239
to explain is the minuet that's this one
而制作尾巴的方式是

137
00:04:03,239 --> 00:04:08,910
to explain is the minuet that's this one
the net the plan for making this this is
山谷褶皱，然后这是这是一个

138
00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:08,920
the net the plan for making this this is
山谷褶皱，这是山脉褶皱，

139
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:10,860
the net the plan for making this this is
how the piece looks so this short piece
然后这是一个山谷褶皱，所以这两个

140
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:10,870
how the piece looks so this short piece
碎片会聚在一起并粘在一起

141
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:13,879
how the piece looks so this short piece
this is the top of the box as it opens
所以在这里你可以看到它是一个山谷

showing you so that's the minuet the
双方都以不同的方式弯曲

165
00:04:46,599 --> 00:04:51,839
showing you so that's the minuet the
next most simple is the conductor so
当您查看实际模型时

166
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:51,849
next most simple is the conductor so
顶部的方式是

167
00:04:51,849 --> 00:04:54,870
next most simple is the conductor so
here's the conductor this is the piece

169
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:57,029
here's the conductor this is the piece
that would be his arm so this is a
但是双方分歧很大，所以他们不得不

170
00:04:57,029 --> 00:04:57,039
that would be his arm so this is a
切成不同的形状给你

171
00:04:57,039 --> 00:05:00,120
that would be his arm so this is a
Valley fold this is a mountain fold this
那个确切的形状，这就是我所做的

172
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:00,130
Valley fold this is a mountain fold this
在这里给你更多，如果我

173
00:05:00,130 --> 00:05:03,000
Valley fold this is a mountain fold this
is also a mountain fold this here is a
只是解释说一个很

174
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:03,010
is also a mountain fold this here is a
复杂的，这是狗的后背

175
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:06,330
is also a mountain fold this here is a
Valley fold this is a mountain fold this
一小会儿，你可以看到

176
00:05:06,330 --> 00:05:06,340
Valley fold this is a mountain fold this
有两个有两个山谷褶皱

177
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:08,459
Valley fold this is a mountain fold this
is a valley fold when it's all put
然后这短片是一座山

178
00:05:08,459 --> 00:05:08,469
is a valley fold when it's all put
折叠，然后这很长的时间

179
00:05:08,469 --> 00:05:09,470
is a valley fold when it's all put
together this is
狗的头是山谷褶皱，

180
00:05:09,470 --> 00:05:09,480
together this is
那你实际上有两座山

181
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:12,370
together this is
it looks like this is the top of the box
折叠所以你去山谷山山

182
00:05:12,370 --> 00:05:12,380
it looks like this is the top of the box
所有角度都被标记为105

183
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:14,720
it looks like this is the top of the box
this is his arm that's going to swing
这就是这里的大角度

184
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:14,730
this is his arm that's going to swing
80度是这个小小的

185
00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:16,850
this is his arm that's going to swing
around so when the whole spread is
那是65度

186
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:16,860
around so when the whole spread is
在那里，然后当你看着这个你

187
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:19,190
around so when the whole spread is
closed it's right back like that and
可以看到这里从山谷开始

188
00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:19,200
closed it's right back like that and
折，所以这第一个是山谷折

189
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:21,980
closed it's right back like that and
then as the spread opens the top of the
然后实际上有两个山褶

190
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:21,990
then as the spread opens the top of the
这个和这个是两个山

191
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:24,560
then as the spread opens the top of the
box opens and his arm moves right round
折叠，然后你得到了狗的头

192
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:24,570
box opens and his arm moves right round
这件作品会是另一个

193
00:05:24,570 --> 00:05:27,260
box opens and his arm moves right round
and again up maybe I didn't say this
谷折，这将粘合在一起

194
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:27,270
and again up maybe I didn't say this
像这样粘在一起，所以这一个

195
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:29,030
and again up maybe I didn't say this
where I've scribbled that's where it's
最早的弹出机制来自

196
00:05:29,030 --> 00:05:29,040
where I've scribbled that's where it's
三十年代初期，我认为是

197
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,920
where I've scribbled that's where it's
glued together see look at this you can
真的是最有趣的游戏之一

198
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:30,930
glued together see look at this you can
而我想做的另一件事

199
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:33,230
glued together see look at this you can
see that's where it's glued together so
添加实际上是当您查看此内容时

200
00:05:33,230 --> 00:05:33,240
see that's where it's glued together so
你看到这些大耳朵

201
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:35,630
see that's where it's glued together so
you just have another look at this you
好吧，耳朵从这些

202
00:05:35,630 --> 00:05:35,640
you just have another look at this you
黄带上的小三角形

203
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:37,970
you just have another look at this you
can see maybe if I hold it round this
这些是耳朵来的地方

204
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:37,980
can see maybe if I hold it round this
在这里和这里，我们刚刚看到的

205
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:40,580
can see maybe if I hold it round this
way you can see the top of the box is a
有三个不同的例子

206
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:40,590
way you can see the top of the box is a
我不了解1930年代的早期机制

207
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:43,400
way you can see the top of the box is a
valley then there's a mountain the top
认为这些天你在任何书中都看到了

208
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:43,410
valley then there's a mountain the top
但这真的很好玩，所以

209
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:45,500
valley then there's a mountain the top
of this is a mountain but you've got
虽然如果他是狗的头和狗的尾巴

210
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:45,510
of this is a mountain but you've got
移动其他两个武装，所以我已经

211
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:47,900
of this is a mountain but you've got
this mountain valley in between and that
称为本教程动臂部分

212
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:47,910
this mountain valley in between and that
三

213
00:05:47,910 --> 00:05:51,860
this mountain valley in between and that
gives you that magnificent movement
[音乐]

214
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:51,870
gives you that magnificent movement
[掌声]

215
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:55,610
gives you that magnificent movement
so if I just explain with that using the

00:05:55,610 --> 00:05:55,620
so if I just explain with that using the
[音乐]

217
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:58,740
so if I just explain with that using the
box mechanism so you get an idea I'll
