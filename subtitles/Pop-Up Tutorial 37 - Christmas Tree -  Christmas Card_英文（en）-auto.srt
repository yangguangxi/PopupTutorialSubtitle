00:04:15,229 --> 00:04:15,239
one out quite easily and quite quickly

165
00:04:15,239 --> 00:04:18,979
one out quite easily and quite quickly
so we'll need a base there's a base

166
00:04:18,979 --> 00:04:18,989
so we'll need a base there's a base

167
00:04:18,989 --> 00:04:21,990
so we'll need a base there's a base
priests really thoroughly so when you

168
00:04:21,990 --> 00:04:22,000
priests really thoroughly so when you

169
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,779
priests really thoroughly so when you
lay the page flat on the table it just

170
00:04:24,779 --> 00:04:24,789
lay the page flat on the table it just

171
00:04:24,789 --> 00:04:27,629
lay the page flat on the table it just
goes flat this is going to be the tree

172
00:04:27,629 --> 00:04:27,639
goes flat this is going to be the tree

173
00:04:27,639 --> 00:04:31,010
goes flat this is going to be the tree
so again it's it's been folded in half

174
00:04:31,010 --> 00:04:31,020
so again it's it's been folded in half

175
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:33,990
so again it's it's been folded in half
you fold it in half and then you fold

176
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:34,000
you fold it in half and then you fold

177
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,779
you fold it in half and then you fold
the angle the type of tree you want so

178
00:04:36,779 --> 00:04:36,789
the angle the type of tree you want so

179
00:04:36,789 --> 00:04:40,439
the angle the type of tree you want so
if you wanted a much you know squat or

180
00:04:40,439 --> 00:04:40,449
if you wanted a much you know squat or

181
00:04:40,449 --> 00:04:42,270
if you wanted a much you know squat or
wider one you could you could follow

182
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:42,280
wider one you could you could follow

183
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:44,760
wider one you could you could follow
this as a different angle and so that's

184
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:44,770
this as a different angle and so that's

185
00:04:44,770 --> 00:04:47,129
this as a different angle and so that's
what we've got this time I'll just cut

186
00:04:47,129 --> 00:04:47,139
what we've got this time I'll just cut

187
00:04:47,139 --> 00:04:55,709
what we've got this time I'll just cut
all this spare off here and now if you

188
00:04:55,709 --> 00:04:55,719
all this spare off here and now if you

189
00:04:55,719 --> 00:04:58,260
all this spare off here and now if you
look at this I've done it in three

190
00:04:58,260 --> 00:04:58,270
look at this I've done it in three

191
00:04:58,270 --> 00:05:00,360
look at this I've done it in three
layers but it doesn't have to be you

192
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:00,370
layers but it doesn't have to be you

193
00:05:00,370 --> 00:05:02,129
layers but it doesn't have to be you
could make it a more complicated tree

194
00:05:02,129 --> 00:05:02,139
could make it a more complicated tree

195
00:05:02,139 --> 00:05:04,860
could make it a more complicated tree
with it four five six as many layers as

196
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:04,870
with it four five six as many layers as

197
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:07,800
with it four five six as many layers as
you like I'm going to go with three

198
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:07,810
you like I'm going to go with three

199
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:10,320
you like I'm going to go with three
again just so it's fairly quick and easy

200
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:10,330
again just so it's fairly quick and easy

201
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:13,920
again just so it's fairly quick and easy
to make start by cutting it into three

202
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:13,930
to make start by cutting it into three

203
00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:19,830
to make start by cutting it into three
sections each section one and two and

204
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:19,840
sections each section one and two and

205
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:24,659
sections each section one and two and
three they've all got the angle of the

206
00:05:24,659 --> 00:05:24,669
three they've all got the angle of the

207
00:05:24,669 --> 00:05:27,689
three they've all got the angle of the
fold to the central crease it's the same

208
00:05:27,689 --> 00:05:27,699
fold to the central crease it's the same

209
00:05:27,699 --> 00:05:33,390
fold to the central crease it's the same
on all three but they overlap so the top

210
00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:33,400
on all three but they overlap so the top

211
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,490
on all three but they overlap so the top
layer overlaps the next and that

212
00:05:35,490 --> 00:05:35,500
layer overlaps the next and that

213
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:37,439
layer overlaps the next and that
overlaps the next so you actually need

214
00:05:37,439 --> 00:05:37,449
overlaps the next so you actually need

215
00:05:37,449 --> 00:05:40,740
overlaps the next so you actually need
to refold them so that the next one can

216
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:40,750
to refold them so that the next one can

217
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:42,570
to refold them so that the next one can
accommodate the one underneath it so

218
00:05:42,570 --> 00:05:42,580
accommodate the one underneath it so

219
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:44,790
accommodate the one underneath it so
this is going to be the bottom layer

220
00:05:44,790 --> 00:05:44,800
this is going to be the bottom layer

221
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,459
this is going to be the bottom layer
we're going to refold that to the same

222
00:05:47,459 --> 00:05:47,469
we're going to refold that to the same

223
00:05:47,469 --> 00:05:50,309
we're going to refold that to the same
angle but you know say another

224
00:05:50,309 --> 00:05:50,319
angle but you know say another

225
00:05:50,319 --> 00:05:56,249
angle but you know say another
centimeter in that's centimeter in this

226
00:05:56,249 --> 00:05:56,259
centimeter in that's centimeter in this

227
00:05:56,259 --> 00:05:57,839
centimeter in that's centimeter in this
is going to be the bottom one I'll just

228
00:05:57,839 --> 00:05:57,849
is going to be the bottom one I'll just

229
00:05:57,849 --> 00:06:06,629
is going to be the bottom one I'll just
cut those tabs cut off that piece and so

230
00:06:06,629 --> 00:06:06,639
cut those tabs cut off that piece and so

231
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:08,249
cut those tabs cut off that piece and so
this is going to fit on here this is

232
00:06:08,249 --> 00:06:08,259
this is going to fit on here this is

233
00:06:08,259 --> 00:06:10,399
this is going to fit on here this is
going to fit on here so we can glue it

234
00:06:10,399 --> 00:06:10,409
going to fit on here so we can glue it

235
00:06:10,409 --> 00:06:14,760
going to fit on here so we can glue it
about here looks about right

236
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:14,770
about here looks about right

237
00:06:14,770 --> 00:06:17,309
about here looks about right
this is gonna be flat as you see when

238
00:06:17,309 --> 00:06:17,319
this is gonna be flat as you see when

239
00:06:17,319 --> 00:06:19,649
this is gonna be flat as you see when
the page is flat the tree is flat when

240
00:06:19,649 --> 00:06:19,659
the page is flat the tree is flat when

241
00:06:19,659 --> 00:06:21,269
the page is flat the tree is flat when
it's standing on our mantelpiece or

242
00:06:21,269 --> 00:06:21,279
it's standing on our mantelpiece or

243
00:06:21,279 --> 00:06:23,310
it's standing on our mantelpiece or
something yeah it's in dimension

244
00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:23,320
something yeah it's in dimension

245
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:28,980
something yeah it's in dimension
3d tree so we'll start with this in this

246
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:28,990
3d tree so we'll start with this in this

247
00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:31,620
3d tree so we'll start with this in this
case I was going to put the tabs

248
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:31,630
case I was going to put the tabs

249
00:06:31,630 --> 00:06:33,540
case I was going to put the tabs
underneath but in actual fact you could

250
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:33,550
underneath but in actual fact you could

251
00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:35,310
underneath but in actual fact you could
have them sticking out sideways and make

252
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:35,320
have them sticking out sideways and make

253
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:37,860
have them sticking out sideways and make
a more freely edge to the tree if you

254
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:37,870
a more freely edge to the tree if you

255
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:41,160
a more freely edge to the tree if you
want it to as it's going flat I can glue

256
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:41,170
want it to as it's going flat I can glue

257
00:06:41,170 --> 00:06:54,840
want it to as it's going flat I can glue
both both tabs at the same time so then

258
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:54,850
both both tabs at the same time so then

259
00:06:54,850 --> 00:06:57,210
both both tabs at the same time so then
just check that position again it's

260
00:06:57,210 --> 00:06:57,220
just check that position again it's

261
00:06:57,220 --> 00:06:58,940
just check that position again it's
going to go there

262
00:06:58,940 --> 00:06:58,950
going to go there

263
00:06:58,950 --> 00:07:02,270
going to go there
line up the central crease on the pop-up

264
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:02,280
line up the central crease on the pop-up

265
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:09,090
line up the central crease on the pop-up
with the central crease on there just

266
00:07:09,090 --> 00:07:09,100
with the central crease on there just

267
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:20,760
with the central crease on there just
make sure that works okay the second one

268
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:20,770
make sure that works okay the second one

269
00:07:20,770 --> 00:07:23,160
make sure that works okay the second one
is going to overlap it again

270
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:23,170
is going to overlap it again

271
00:07:23,170 --> 00:07:25,260
is going to overlap it again
we need to refold this at the same angle

272
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:25,270
we need to refold this at the same angle

273
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:27,540
we need to refold this at the same angle
but not take it in as much as the

274
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:27,550
but not take it in as much as the

275
00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:29,850
but not take it in as much as the
previous one so the last one it came in

276
00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:29,860
previous one so the last one it came in

277
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:33,210
previous one so the last one it came in
about a centimeter so this one I'm going

278
00:07:33,210 --> 00:07:33,220
about a centimeter so this one I'm going

279
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:35,570
about a centimeter so this one I'm going
to bring it in about half a centimeter

280
00:07:35,570 --> 00:07:35,580
to bring it in about half a centimeter

281
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:38,580
to bring it in about half a centimeter
so it's a brought in a smaller amount

282
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:38,590
so it's a brought in a smaller amount

283
00:07:38,590 --> 00:07:50,790
so it's a brought in a smaller amount
there and again I'll cut both tabs but

284
00:07:50,790 --> 00:07:50,800
there and again I'll cut both tabs but

285
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,140
there and again I'll cut both tabs but
the other thing you need to do here

286
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:52,150
the other thing you need to do here

287
00:07:52,150 --> 00:07:56,070
the other thing you need to do here
because it's going to overlap it you

288
00:07:56,070 --> 00:07:56,080
because it's going to overlap it you

289
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:58,320
because it's going to overlap it you
need to cut away a bit here this piece

290
00:07:58,320 --> 00:07:58,330
need to cut away a bit here this piece

291
00:07:58,330 --> 00:08:00,990
need to cut away a bit here this piece
of tab will clash with the bit of tree

292
00:08:00,990 --> 00:08:01,000
of tab will clash with the bit of tree

293
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,510
of tab will clash with the bit of tree
underneath it so we'll actually take off

294
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:03,520
underneath it so we'll actually take off

295
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:15,310
underneath it so we'll actually take off
a piece of that

296
00:08:15,310 --> 00:08:15,320


297
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:18,350
saying fold those under and this should

298
00:08:18,350 --> 00:08:18,360
saying fold those under and this should

299
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:20,750
saying fold those under and this should
be able to just fit on on top of there

300
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:20,760
be able to just fit on on top of there

301
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:33,680
be able to just fit on on top of there
quite comfortably you need to line up

302
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:33,690
quite comfortably you need to line up

303
00:08:33,690 --> 00:08:36,740
quite comfortably you need to line up
the central crease on this pop-up piece

304
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:36,750
the central crease on this pop-up piece

305
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:40,810
the central crease on this pop-up piece
with the central crease on the page so

306
00:08:40,810 --> 00:08:40,820
with the central crease on the page so

307
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:45,350
with the central crease on the page so
that's number two we'll just try closing

308
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:45,360
that's number two we'll just try closing

309
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:50,980
that's number two we'll just try closing
that making sure it's still all works

310
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:50,990


311
00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:55,190
there we go and then the third one we

312
00:08:55,190 --> 00:08:55,200
there we go and then the third one we

313
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,530
there we go and then the third one we
don't need to refold it at all but we

314
00:08:57,530 --> 00:08:57,540
don't need to refold it at all but we

315
00:08:57,540 --> 00:08:59,360
don't need to refold it at all but we
still need to cut out a little piece at

316
00:08:59,360 --> 00:08:59,370
still need to cut out a little piece at

317
00:08:59,370 --> 00:09:01,810
still need to cut out a little piece at
the bottom so it can overlap

318
00:09:01,810 --> 00:09:01,820
the bottom so it can overlap

319
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:04,820
the bottom so it can overlap
satisfactorily also this at the top as

320
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:04,830
satisfactorily also this at the top as

321
00:09:04,830 --> 00:09:07,250
satisfactorily also this at the top as
we're folding them under those two tabs

322
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:07,260
we're folding them under those two tabs

323
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:08,900
we're folding them under those two tabs
are going to clash so I'll just cut a

324
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:08,910
are going to clash so I'll just cut a

325
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:12,230
are going to clash so I'll just cut a
bit off there just so it's there's not

326
00:09:12,230 --> 00:09:12,240
bit off there just so it's there's not

327
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:16,310
bit off there just so it's there's not
going to be a problem and here we need

328
00:09:16,310 --> 00:09:16,320
going to be a problem and here we need

329
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:25,880
going to be a problem and here we need
to cut exciting over there and again we

330
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:25,890
to cut exciting over there and again we

331
00:09:25,890 --> 00:09:28,190
to cut exciting over there and again we
can put the glue on both tabs at the

332
00:09:28,190 --> 00:09:28,200
can put the glue on both tabs at the

333
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:40,619
can put the glue on both tabs at the
same time

334
00:09:40,619 --> 00:09:40,629


335
00:09:40,629 --> 00:09:45,309
and line up the central crease with the

336
00:09:45,309 --> 00:09:45,319
and line up the central crease with the

337
00:09:45,319 --> 00:09:48,910
and line up the central crease with the
central crease of the base cards overlap

338
00:09:48,910 --> 00:09:48,920
central crease of the base cards overlap

339
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:51,970
central crease of the base cards overlap
it with a bit of tree below it there we

340
00:09:51,970 --> 00:09:51,980
it with a bit of tree below it there we

341
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:53,879
it with a bit of tree below it there we
go

342
00:09:53,879 --> 00:09:53,889
go

343
00:09:53,889 --> 00:09:56,980
go
that's all working nicely and now it

344
00:09:56,980 --> 00:09:56,990
that's all working nicely and now it

345
00:09:56,990 --> 00:09:58,960
that's all working nicely and now it
looks put our table up to date at the

346
00:09:58,960 --> 00:09:58,970
looks put our table up to date at the

347
00:09:58,970 --> 00:10:00,550
looks put our table up to date at the
bottom so this is just an ordinary

348
00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:00,560
bottom so this is just an ordinary

349
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:03,009
bottom so this is just an ordinary
parallel fold it's a piece of card with

350
00:10:03,009 --> 00:10:03,019
parallel fold it's a piece of card with

351
00:10:03,019 --> 00:10:05,439
parallel fold it's a piece of card with
three parallel creases and this is going

352
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:05,449
three parallel creases and this is going

353
00:10:05,449 --> 00:10:08,470
three parallel creases and this is going
to glue flat down there as well so you

354
00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:08,480
to glue flat down there as well so you

355
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:18,369
to glue flat down there as well so you
just put glue on both those tabs and

356
00:10:18,369 --> 00:10:18,379
just put glue on both those tabs and

357
00:10:18,379 --> 00:10:20,980
just put glue on both those tabs and
again you line up the central crease

358
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:20,990
again you line up the central crease

359
00:10:20,990 --> 00:10:25,059
again you line up the central crease
with that central crease of the base we

360
00:10:25,059 --> 00:10:25,069
with that central crease of the base we

361
00:10:25,069 --> 00:10:29,319
with that central crease of the base we
got under the tree a bit this is the

362
00:10:29,319 --> 00:10:29,329
got under the tree a bit this is the

363
00:10:29,329 --> 00:10:31,780
got under the tree a bit this is the
