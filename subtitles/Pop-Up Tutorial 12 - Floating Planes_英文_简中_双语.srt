00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:44,730
folds absolutely flush there and then
您可以在每一侧贴上浮动

111
00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:55,490
folds absolutely flush there and then
you put glue on the other end and now if
飞机到那些，所以将在这里

112
00:03:55,490 --> 00:03:55,500
you put glue on the other end and now if
这是一张有折痕的卡片

113
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:58,009
you put glue on the other end and now if
you fold it into its closed position and

you fold it into its closed position and
这种折痕与

115
00:03:58,019 --> 00:04:00,170
you fold it into its closed position and
so with it in its closed position
沟渠

116
00:04:00,170 --> 00:04:00,180
so with it in its closed position
所以它找到了自然的黏附

117
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:05,180
so with it in its closed position
you then close the base so this gives
位置

118
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:05,190
you then close the base so this gives
还有第三种方法可以提高

119

into and on the side so you can build
other pop-ups onto those you've also got
第二个是V形折叠，因此您可以

194
00:06:00,909 --> 00:06:00,919
other pop-ups onto those you've also got
看到这是V折的区别

195

00:06:07,849 --> 00:06:10,450
the whole pop up is is built on and you
can you can stick pieces onto those so
垂直向下，所以如果我们看这个

200
00:06:10,450 --> 00:06:10,460
can you can stick pieces onto those so
你会看到犀牛头

201
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:11,890
can you can stick pieces onto those so
that they stick forward so this
在页面打开时向您靠拢

202
00:06:11,890 --> 00:06:11,900
that they stick forward so this
所以我想告诉你的最后一行是

219
00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:39,850
and then it has two parallelograms one
on each side you can stick a floating
那么你不必再做

220
00:06:39,850 --> 00:06:39,860
on each side you can stick a floating
平行四边形与我的尺寸完全相同

221

on each side you can stick a floating
plane onto those so that would be here
刚刚在我制作的示例中向您展示了

222
00:06:42,339 --> 00:06:42,349
plane onto those so that would be here
你可以把它更长一些

223
00:06:42,349 --> 00:06:45,040
plane onto those so that would be here
it is piece of cards with a crease in
可以在这里另辟leg径

224
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:45,050
it is piece of cards with a crease in
另一个在这里，然后

225
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:47,850
it is piece of cards with a crease in
the middle you just make sure that this
浮动飞机会再次像这样

226
00:06:47,850 --> 00:06:47,860
the middle you just make sure that this
当然，您必须确保

227
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:50,740
the middle you just make sure that this
this crease is is lined up with that
底座足够长，所以不会

228
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:50,750
this crease is is lined up with that
折叠时伸出，然后

229
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:51,430
this crease is is lined up with that
gully
重要的是

230
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:51,440
gully
这条腿和这条腿之间的长度

231
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,230
gully
so it finds its natural sticking
这个长度长度a与这里相同

232
00:06:53,230 --> 00:06:53,240
so it finds its natural sticking
从山脊到这里

233
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:57,580
so it finds its natural sticking
position
在此连接的长度也是

234


腿这个这个高度这个是B这个

235
00:06:57,590 --> 00:07:00,260
there's a third way of actually raising
需要匹配这个高度

236
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:00,270
there's a third way of actually raising
初始平行折叠，这是长度B

237
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:04,400
there's a third way of actually raising
a plane in the middle of the page that's
另一个变化是您的基础

238
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:04,410
a plane in the middle of the page that's
脊椎板在这里建造

239
00:07:04,410 --> 00:07:07,040
a plane in the middle of the page that's
this way so in this case you would build
将平行线折叠到上面然后

240
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:07,050
this way so in this case you would build
其实并不一定要经常

241
00:07:07,050 --> 00:07:09,250
this way so in this case you would build
out two parallelograms one on each side
平行四边形可以做不对称

242
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:09,260
out two parallelograms one on each side
平行折叠到上面，所以你可能会上升

243
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:11,930
out two parallelograms one on each side
this is held firmly in place by these
像这样，这样下去

244
00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:11,940
this is held firmly in place by these
所以在这种情况下，这就是

245
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:14,510
this is held firmly in place by these
two triangles each of these is just
你在工作，正在测量

246
00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:14,520
two triangles each of these is just
到这里，就是这个长度再加上这个

247
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:17,900
two triangles each of these is just
their two 45-degree angles and let the
长度必须等于这个长度加上这个

248
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:17,910
their two 45-degree angles and let the
长度，这是不对称的平行

249
00:07:17,910 --> 00:07:19,460
their two 45-degree angles and let the
two of them balance each other so they
教程六中介绍的折叠

250
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:19,470
two of them balance each other so they
而另一边则不必

251
00:07:19,470 --> 00:07:21,740
two of them balance each other so they
pull against each other so as you open
与此相同

252
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:21,750
pull against each other so as you open
可能是您知道类似

253
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:24,740
pull against each other so as you open
and close the page that raises that
这样，以这种方式浮动

254
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:24,750
and close the page that raises that
您可以建立在其上的飞机可以

255
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:26,780
and close the page that raises that
