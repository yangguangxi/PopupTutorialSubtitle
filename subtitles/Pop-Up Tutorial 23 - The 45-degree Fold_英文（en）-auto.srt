00:00:37,579 --> 00:00:41,740
this tutorial is about 45 degrees balls
so here's an example you use two pieces

4
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:41,750
so here's an example you use two pieces

5
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:44,830
so here's an example you use two pieces
that are each two 45-degree folds and

6
00:00:44,830 --> 00:00:44,840
that are each two 45-degree folds and

7
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:47,200
that are each two 45-degree folds and
they use to raise a piece vertically

8
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:47,210
they use to raise a piece vertically

9
00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:49,660
they use to raise a piece vertically

00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:03,400
in this spread you can see here inside
here there are two 45-degree folds that

18
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:03,410
here there are two 45-degree folds that

19
00:01:03,410 --> 00:01:05,860
here there are two 45-degree folds that
are used to raise the central pillar

20
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:05,870
are used to raise the central pillar

21
00:01:05,870 --> 00:01:08,950
are used to raise the central pillar
that holds up this square spread and

22
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:08,960
that holds up this square spread and

23
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:11,890
that holds up this square spread and
that's actually hiding a v-fold that's

24
00:01:11,890 --> 00:01:11,900
that's actually hiding a v-fold that's

25
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:13,990
that's actually hiding a v-fold that's
underneath it but the main point in this

26
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:14,000
underneath it but the main point in this

27
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,680
underneath it but the main point in this
tutorial is the two 45-degree folks

28
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:16,690
tutorial is the two 45-degree folks

29
00:01:16,690 --> 00:01:20,380
tutorial is the two 45-degree folks
there's another example here this is The

30
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:20,390
there's another example here this is The

31
00:01:20,390 --> 00:01:22,750
there's another example here this is The
Wonderful Wizard of Oz by Roberts óbuda

00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:26,920
Wonderful Wizard of Oz by Roberts óbuda
and in the final spread the pillar that

34
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:26,930
and in the final spread the pillar that

35
00:01:26,930 --> 00:01:29,289
and in the final spread the pillar that
holds up the throne if you look at it

36
00:01:29,289 --> 00:01:29,299
holds up the throne if you look at it

37
00:01:29,299 --> 00:01:31,870
holds up the throne if you look at it
underneath here there are two 45-degree

38
00:01:31,870 --> 00:01:31,880
underneath here there are two 45-degree

39
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:34,480
underneath here there are two 45-degree
folds so that's the main use of this

40
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:34,490
folds so that's the main use of this

41
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:41,770
folds so that's the main use of this
this mechanism so this is another way of

42
00:01:41,770 --> 00:01:41,780
this mechanism so this is another way of

43
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:44,350
this mechanism so this is another way of
making a 45-degree fold this is using

44
00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:44,360
making a 45-degree fold this is using

45
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:48,039
making a 45-degree fold this is using
slots which is in tutorial 11 take two

46
00:01:48,039 --> 00:01:48,049
slots which is in tutorial 11 take two

47
00:01:48,049 --> 00:01:51,310
slots which is in tutorial 11 take two
pieces of cards they both got a crease

48
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:51,320
pieces of cards they both got a crease

49
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:54,999
pieces of cards they both got a crease
along the bottom a gluing tab put them

50
00:01:54,999 --> 00:01:55,009
along the bottom a gluing tab put them

51
00:01:55,009 --> 00:01:58,450
along the bottom a gluing tab put them
reverse them around this is classic

52
00:01:58,450 --> 00:01:58,460
reverse them around this is classic

53
00:01:58,460 --> 00:02:01,090
reverse them around this is classic
slots the way you make slot so they're

54
00:02:01,090 --> 00:02:01,100
slots the way you make slot so they're

55
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:03,160
slots the way you make slot so they're
put together like this and then you cut

56
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:03,170
put together like this and then you cut

57
00:02:03,170 --> 00:02:08,139
put together like this and then you cut
up to the middle two cups about two

58
00:02:08,139 --> 00:02:08,149
up to the middle two cups about two

59
00:02:08,149 --> 00:02:09,969
up to the middle two cups about two
millimeters apart three millimeters

60
00:02:09,969 --> 00:02:09,979
millimeters apart three millimeters

61
00:02:09,979 --> 00:02:10,870
millimeters apart three millimeters
apart

62
00:02:10,870 --> 00:02:10,880
apart

63
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:20,490
apart
so the two pieces will easily interlock

64
00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:20,500


65
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:23,230
this one can stick down to the spine

66
00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:23,240
this one can stick down to the spine

67
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:26,470
this one can stick down to the spine
flush with the spine this one will come

68
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:26,480
flush with the spine this one will come

69
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:30,070
flush with the spine this one will come
down on top of it and interlock with it

70
00:02:30,070 --> 00:02:30,080
down on top of it and interlock with it

71
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,680
down on top of it and interlock with it
but before we do that we need to add the

72
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:32,690
but before we do that we need to add the

73
00:02:32,690 --> 00:02:36,130
but before we do that we need to add the
45-degree folds so 45-degree fold is

74
00:02:36,130 --> 00:02:36,140
45-degree folds so 45-degree fold is

75
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:38,050
45-degree folds so 45-degree fold is
very easy where you've got a right angle

76
00:02:38,050 --> 00:02:38,060
very easy where you've got a right angle

77
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:41,350
very easy where you've got a right angle
you just fold the two edges up against

78
00:02:41,350 --> 00:02:41,360
you just fold the two edges up against

79
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:46,300
you just fold the two edges up against
each other then one side crease it

80
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:46,310
each other then one side crease it

81
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:49,770
each other then one side crease it
really well so here are folding one

82
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:49,780
really well so here are folding one

83
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:53,080
really well so here are folding one
45-degree fold and then you fold the the

84
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:53,090
45-degree fold and then you fold the the

85
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:55,300
45-degree fold and then you fold the the
crease up against the line so that's

86
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:55,310
crease up against the line so that's

87
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:57,400
crease up against the line so that's
dividing the right angle into two

88
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:57,410
dividing the right angle into two

89
00:02:57,410 --> 00:03:03,220
dividing the right angle into two
45-degree folds there it is crease it

90
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:03,230
45-degree folds there it is crease it

91
00:03:03,230 --> 00:03:07,360
45-degree folds there it is crease it
well and now we stick this one down

92
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:07,370
well and now we stick this one down

93
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:09,880
well and now we stick this one down
flush with the spine I'll just take

94
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:09,890
flush with the spine I'll just take

95
00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:27,660
flush with the spine I'll just take
these these corners off here

96
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:27,670


97
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:31,180
there's that one the other piece these

98
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:31,190
there's that one the other piece these

99
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:33,670
there's that one the other piece these
are going to stick down the two taps are

100
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:33,680
are going to stick down the two taps are

101
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,290
are going to stick down the two taps are
going to stick down at right angles to

102
00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:35,300
going to stick down at right angles to

103
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:37,480
going to stick down at right angles to
the spine probably to give it some

104
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:37,490
the spine probably to give it some

105
00:03:37,490 --> 00:03:39,390
the spine probably to give it some
balance so you can put one each way

106
00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:39,400
balance so you can put one each way

107
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:41,770
balance so you can put one each way
again I'll make sure these creases are

108
00:03:41,770 --> 00:03:41,780
again I'll make sure these creases are

109
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:44,920
again I'll make sure these creases are
really good snip off the corners just so

110
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:44,930
really good snip off the corners just so

111
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:55,230
really good snip off the corners just so
there's no points that are going to snag

112
00:03:55,230 --> 00:03:55,240


113
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:58,030
you can stick both these down at the

114
00:03:58,030 --> 00:03:58,040
you can stick both these down at the

115
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:03,640
you can stick both these down at the
same time I put glue on opposite sides

116
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:03,650
same time I put glue on opposite sides

117
00:04:03,650 --> 00:04:05,500
same time I put glue on opposite sides
as they're going to face in opposite

118
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:05,510
as they're going to face in opposite

119
00:04:05,510 --> 00:04:08,620
as they're going to face in opposite
directions smear the glue right up to

120
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:08,630
directions smear the glue right up to

121
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:17,280
directions smear the glue right up to
the crease

122
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:17,290


123
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:20,610
looks about right and then just fold the

124
00:04:20,610 --> 00:04:20,620
looks about right and then just fold the

125
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:22,800
looks about right and then just fold the
crown through to make sure it's all

126
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:22,810
crown through to make sure it's all

127
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:29,100
crown through to make sure it's all
working comfortably so there it is

128
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:29,110
working comfortably so there it is

129
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:30,690
working comfortably so there it is
that's another way of doing it and then

130
00:04:30,690 --> 00:04:30,700
that's another way of doing it and then

131
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:32,460
that's another way of doing it and then
having built this you can actually take

132
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:32,470
having built this you can actually take

133
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:35,700
having built this you can actually take
other pieces and just stick them on so

134
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:35,710
other pieces and just stick them on so

135
00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:37,970
other pieces and just stick them on so
you can start constructing some sort of

136
00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:37,980
you can start constructing some sort of

137
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:41,490
you can start constructing some sort of
tree or flower or you know whatever you

138
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:41,500
tree or flower or you know whatever you

139
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:43,200
tree or flower or you know whatever you
want to make really you can stick pieces

140
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:43,210
want to make really you can stick pieces

141
00:04:43,210 --> 00:04:50,220
want to make really you can stick pieces
onto these you've also got two gullies

142
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:50,230
onto these you've also got two gullies

143
00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:52,050
onto these you've also got two gullies
that you can build into so I'll just

144
00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:52,060
that you can build into so I'll just

145
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:59,100
that you can build into so I'll just
stick these on as it closes you'll see

146
00:04:59,100 --> 00:04:59,110
stick these on as it closes you'll see

147
00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:01,680
stick these on as it closes you'll see
this is a gully that's closing and this

148
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:01,690
this is a gully that's closing and this

149
00:05:01,690 --> 00:05:03,750
this is a gully that's closing and this
is a gully that's closing so both of

150
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:03,760
is a gully that's closing so both of

151
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:07,770
is a gully that's closing so both of
those you can add counter folded strips

152
00:05:07,770 --> 00:05:07,780
those you can add counter folded strips

153
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:12,960
those you can add counter folded strips
too so we take a piece like this crease

154
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:12,970
too so we take a piece like this crease

155
00:05:12,970 --> 00:05:17,940
too so we take a piece like this crease
it well fold an extra pair of creases

156
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:17,950
it well fold an extra pair of creases

157
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:22,500
it well fold an extra pair of creases
into it so in tutorial 8 we looked at

158
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:22,510
into it so in tutorial 8 we looked at

159
00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:24,450
into it so in tutorial 8 we looked at
counter folding pieces so you can take

160
00:05:24,450 --> 00:05:24,460
counter folding pieces so you can take

161
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:26,580
counter folding pieces so you can take
small pieces like this and you can just

162
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:26,590
small pieces like this and you can just

163
00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:29,300
small pieces like this and you can just
stick them into these two gullies

164
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:29,310
stick them into these two gullies

165
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:32,100
stick them into these two gullies
created by the main mechanism so I'll

166
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:32,110
created by the main mechanism so I'll

167
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:36,990
created by the main mechanism so I'll
just stick one of these in and then any

168
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:37,000
just stick one of these in and then any

169
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,480
just stick one of these in and then any
of these planes that have been created

170
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:39,490
of these planes that have been created

171
00:05:39,490 --> 00:05:41,850
of these planes that have been created
you can carry on building on those so

172
00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:41,860
you can carry on building on those so

173
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:44,160
you can carry on building on those so
I'll just make sure this closes down

174
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:44,170
I'll just make sure this closes down

175
00:05:44,170 --> 00:05:52,290
I'll just make sure this closes down
okay let's just trim it back a bit so

176
00:05:52,290 --> 00:05:52,300
okay let's just trim it back a bit so

177
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:53,550
okay let's just trim it back a bit so
there it is and you can just keep

178
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:53,560
there it is and you can just keep

179
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:56,130
there it is and you can just keep
building adding extra pieces onto these

180
00:05:56,130 --> 00:05:56,140
building adding extra pieces onto these

181
00:05:56,140 --> 00:05:59,130
building adding extra pieces onto these
to create whatever sort of sculpture

182
00:05:59,130 --> 00:05:59,140
to create whatever sort of sculpture

183
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:02,520
to create whatever sort of sculpture
you're interested in making you another

184
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:02,530
you're interested in making you another

185
00:06:02,530 --> 00:06:10,260
you're interested in making you another
piece come on up like this any of these

186
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:10,270
piece come on up like this any of these

187
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:13,710
piece come on up like this any of these
planes can be built on I'll just show

188
00:06:13,710 --> 00:06:13,720
planes can be built on I'll just show

189
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:15,990
planes can be built on I'll just show
you another example this is one red duct

190
00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:16,000
you another example this is one red duct

191
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,830

he's made of tree using this technique

194
00:06:22,770 --> 00:06:22,780
he's made of tree using this technique

195
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:25,740
he's made of tree using this technique
if you look at these two claims this is

196
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:25,750
if you look at these two claims this is

197
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:28,190
if you look at these two claims this is
the mechanism you can see that these are

198
00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:28,200
the mechanism you can see that these are

199
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:30,900
the mechanism you can see that these are
45-degree folds on each side on these

200
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:30,910
45-degree folds on each side on these

201
00:06:30,910 --> 00:06:32,910
45-degree folds on each side on these
two these other ones are coming in at a

202
00:06:32,910 --> 00:06:32,920
two these other ones are coming in at a

203
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,920
two these other ones are coming in at a
different angle so that creases have

204
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:34,930
different angle so that creases have

205
00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:38,910
different angle so that creases have
been adjusted and then you can also use

206
00:06:38,910 --> 00:06:38,920
been adjusted and then you can also use

207
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:41,340
been adjusted and then you can also use
it for things like this this is using

208
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:41,350
it for things like this this is using

209
00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:45,240
it for things like this this is using
the same idea this is a bridge so these

210
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:45,250
the same idea this is a bridge so these

211
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:47,460
the same idea this is a bridge so these
are the two 45-degree folds they're

212
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:47,470
are the two 45-degree folds they're

213
00:06:47,470 --> 00:06:49,470
are the two 45-degree folds they're
pulling up the whole mechanism you have

214
00:06:49,470 --> 00:06:49,480
pulling up the whole mechanism you have

215
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:52,230
pulling up the whole mechanism you have
to have to they work in opposition to

216
00:06:52,230 --> 00:06:52,240
to have to they work in opposition to

217
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,600
to have to they work in opposition to
each other in this case you can see

218
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:54,610
each other in this case you can see

219
00:06:54,610 --> 00:06:56,940
each other in this case you can see
you've got to have some balance so the

220
00:06:56,940 --> 00:06:56,950
you've got to have some balance so the

221
00:06:56,950 --> 00:07:00,090
you've got to have some balance so the
top of this bridge piece a is the same

222
00:07:00,090 --> 00:07:00,100
top of this bridge piece a is the same

223
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:02,010
top of this bridge piece a is the same
length between the Spiner where it

224
00:07:02,010 --> 00:07:02,020
length between the Spiner where it

225
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:03,780
length between the Spiner where it
sticks down and on the other side B is

226
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:03,790
sticks down and on the other side B is

227
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:06,450
sticks down and on the other side B is
the same length there so that you've got

228
00:07:06,450 --> 00:07:06,460
the same length there so that you've got

229
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:09,420
the same length there so that you've got
balance and the last thing I'd like to

230
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:09,430
balance and the last thing I'd like to

231
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:12,720
balance and the last thing I'd like to
show you is this one this is using the

232
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:12,730
show you is this one this is using the

233
00:07:12,730 --> 00:07:14,970
show you is this one this is using the
same technique as we used here where

234
00:07:14,970 --> 00:07:14,980
same technique as we used here where

235
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:17,190
same technique as we used here where
you've got interlocking pieces but the

236
00:07:17,190 --> 00:07:17,200
you've got interlocking pieces but the

237
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:20,370
you've got interlocking pieces but the
whole middle section has been cut out so

238
00:07:20,370 --> 00:07:20,380
whole middle section has been cut out so

239
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:23,250
whole middle section has been cut out so
we've got this dragon again if you look

240
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:23,260
we've got this dragon again if you look

241
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:25,950
