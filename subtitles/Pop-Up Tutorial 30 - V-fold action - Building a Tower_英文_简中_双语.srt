down nearer to the page and so then you
在此基础上构建，因此您可以构建一个

12
00:00:52,419 --> 00:00:52,429
down nearer to the page and so then you
通过构建这些曲折效果

13
00:00:52,429 --> 00:00:53,799
down nearer to the page and so then you
can build another view fold on it
反向指向B折叠，所以这是一个

14
00:00:53,799 --> 00:00:53,809
can build another view fold on it
我制作的非常原始的版本，我会

15
00:00:53,809 --> 00:00:56,470
can build another view fold on it
pointing in the other direction and that
一分钟告诉你我是怎么做到的

16
00:00:56,470 --> 00:00:56,480
pointing in the other direction and that

22
00:01:02,439 --> 00:01:02,449
build onto that and so you can build a
结束，这是这些塔之一

23
00:01:02,449 --> 00:01:05,670
build onto that and so you can build a
sort of zigzag effect by building these

其中之一的简化​​版本

94
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:46,060
so just enjoy the height and your future
非常彻底地从底片开始

95
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:49,259
so just enjoy the height and your future
future work so we'll explain it and then
弄皱，然后我已经预先切好了

96
00:02:49,259 --> 00:02:49,269
future work so we'll explain it and then
这些是新褶皱，我认为是

97
00:02:49,269 --> 00:02:51,780
future work so we'll explain it and then
we've got this one this is another book
教程二是直角V折

98
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:51,790
we've got this one this is another book
所以他们只是在中间折痕

99

comes up really high above the page this
将会是另一个

104
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:03,010
comes up really high above the page this
所以整个事情都会往前走，

105
00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:04,110

你越靠近脊椎90度

108
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:07,000
these are parallelograms being raised by
运动越多，

109
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,539
these are parallelograms being raised by
it you look behind and you can see it's
闪光一点点，但如果你90岁

110
00:03:09,539 --> 00:03:09,549

00:03:12,569 --> 00:03:12,579
an array of parallelograms and people
度，你必须上升像

113
00:03:12,579 --> 00:03:15,479
an array of parallelograms and people
raising this floating plane which has
像这样的85

114
00:03:15,479 --> 00:03:15,489
raising this floating plane which has
你从一面向下开始

115
00:03:15,489 --> 00:03:16,620
raising this floating plane which has
got another v-fold
我要像我一样接近90度

116
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:16,630
got another v-fold
可以与脊柱90度贴合吗

117
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:18,599
got another v-fold
and another so that's how you get this
向下折叠，然后关闭底座，然后折叠

118
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:18,609
and another so that's how you get this
找到它的自然黏附位置

119
00:03:18,609 --> 00:03:21,210
and another so that's how you get this
sort of constant interaction that's all
这是第一个V螺栓，我们想要

120
00:03:21,210 --> 00:03:21,220
sort of constant interaction that's all
下一个它需要被卡住

121
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:23,940
sort of constant interaction that's all
based on the fact that the v-fold folds
与之平行，所以我只用它

122
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:23,950
based on the fact that the v-fold folds
小卡片给我

123
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:26,009
based on the fact that the v-fold folds
down forwards which gives you a plane
保证平行线粘贴

124
00:03:26,009 --> 00:03:26,019
down forwards which gives you a plane
有一条线我们只是坚持下去

125
00:03:26,019 --> 00:03:28,080
down forwards which gives you a plane
that you can then build on and go higher
方面，我会保留以备将来参考

126
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:28,090
that you can then build on and go higher
所以我们再次将其粘贴到花键上

127
00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:29,490
that you can then build on and go higher
and higher so you end up with a
中央折痕对齐的线

128
00:03:29,490 --> 00:03:29,500
and higher so you end up with a
脊椎折叠关闭，我们必须

129
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:32,280
and higher so you end up with a
structure which is higher than the total
这里要非常小心，因为我们有

130
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:32,290
structure which is higher than the total
另一个已经就位

131
00:03:32,290 --> 00:03:35,310
structure which is higher than the total
height of the page of the book so the
有两个相同的V形折叠，现在我们

132
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:35,320
height of the page of the book so the
可以在上面放一个浮动飞机

133
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:36,810
height of the page of the book so the
next one this is a very pretty little
所以就拿其中一件吧

134
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:36,820
next one this is a very pretty little
应该是正确的，你可以永远
