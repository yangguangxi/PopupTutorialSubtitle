00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:36,599
in this tutorial we're going to look at

2
00:00:36,599 --> 00:00:36,609
in this tutorial we're going to look at

3
00:00:36,609 --> 00:00:39,119
in this tutorial we're going to look at
the twisting mechanism which is a very

4
00:00:39,119 --> 00:00:39,129
the twisting mechanism which is a very

5
00:00:39,129 --> 00:00:40,939
the twisting mechanism which is a very
pleasing mechanism it has a very unusual

6
00:00:40,939 --> 00:00:40,949
pleasing mechanism it has a very unusual

7
00:00:40,949 --> 00:00:44,819
pleasing mechanism it has a very unusual
action as the page opens the mechanism

8
00:00:44,819 --> 00:00:44,829
action as the page opens the mechanism

9
00:00:44,829 --> 00:00:48,479
action as the page opens the mechanism
twists around it's it's made of two V

10
00:00:48,479 --> 00:00:48,489
twists around it's it's made of two V

11
00:00:48,489 --> 00:00:51,029
twists around it's it's made of two V
files pointing at each other when when

12
00:00:51,029 --> 00:00:51,039
files pointing at each other when when

13
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:53,309
files pointing at each other when when
the base is flat they lie flat and then

14
00:00:53,309 --> 00:00:53,319
the base is flat they lie flat and then

15
00:00:53,319 --> 00:00:54,869
the base is flat they lie flat and then
you can build a number of things on top

16
00:00:54,869 --> 00:00:54,879
you can build a number of things on top

17
00:00:54,879 --> 00:01:01,229
you can build a number of things on top
of it so here is an example as it opens

18
00:01:01,229 --> 00:01:01,239
of it so here is an example as it opens

19
00:01:01,239 --> 00:01:04,500
of it so here is an example as it opens
the figure twists around and opens up in

20
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:04,510
the figure twists around and opens up in

21
00:01:04,510 --> 00:01:08,190
the figure twists around and opens up in
essence you've got six planes so there's

22
00:01:08,190 --> 00:01:08,200
essence you've got six planes so there's

23
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:11,520
essence you've got six planes so there's
two on each top and bottom on each of

24
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:11,530
two on each top and bottom on each of

25
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:13,170
two on each top and bottom on each of
the V folds and then it's got two on the

26
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:13,180
the V folds and then it's got two on the

27
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:14,999
the V folds and then it's got two on the
parallel folds on top and then the

28
00:01:14,999 --> 00:01:15,009
parallel folds on top and then the

29
00:01:15,009 --> 00:01:16,620
parallel folds on top and then the
gullies that you can build into the

30
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:16,630
gullies that you can build into the

31
00:01:16,630 --> 00:01:19,740
gullies that you can build into the
gullies that that close as the base

32
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:19,750
gullies that that close as the base

33
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:22,170
gullies that that close as the base
closes you've got one obviously in the

34
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:22,180
closes you've got one obviously in the

35
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:25,260
closes you've got one obviously in the
top underneath the parallel fold you've

36
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:25,270
top underneath the parallel fold you've

37
00:01:25,270 --> 00:01:27,599
top underneath the parallel fold you've
got two under top and two on the bottom

38
00:01:27,599 --> 00:01:27,609
got two under top and two on the bottom

39
00:01:27,609 --> 00:01:30,209
got two under top and two on the bottom
where the V folds are and then within

40
00:01:30,209 --> 00:01:30,219
where the V folds are and then within

41
00:01:30,219 --> 00:01:32,160
where the V folds are and then within
the v-folds you've got another two so

42
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:32,170
the v-folds you've got another two so

43
00:01:32,170 --> 00:01:35,219
the v-folds you've got another two so
you've got four there two there six and

44
00:01:35,219 --> 00:01:35,229
you've got four there two there six and

45
00:01:35,229 --> 00:01:36,870
you've got four there two there six and
then one there so seven gullies to

46
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:36,880
then one there so seven gullies to

47
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:39,810
then one there so seven gullies to
building and this one hasn't actually

48
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:39,820
building and this one hasn't actually

49
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:41,760
building and this one hasn't actually
built into any of the gullies it's just

50
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:41,770
built into any of the gullies it's just

51
00:01:41,770 --> 00:01:44,580
built into any of the gullies it's just
extending the plains so that these the

52
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:44,590
extending the plains so that these the

53
00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:46,679
extending the plains so that these the
head and arm that's coming off one plane

54
00:01:46,679 --> 00:01:46,689
head and arm that's coming off one plane

55
00:01:46,689 --> 00:01:48,389
head and arm that's coming off one plane
this is coming off one and then these

56
00:01:48,389 --> 00:01:48,399
this is coming off one and then these

57
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:50,580
this is coming off one and then these
are coming off two others so it's using

58
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:50,590
are coming off two others so it's using

59
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:56,980
are coming off two others so it's using
four of their planes

60
00:01:56,980 --> 00:01:56,990


61
00:01:56,990 --> 00:01:59,859
you need a base sheet here's the base

62
00:01:59,859 --> 00:01:59,869
you need a base sheet here's the base

63
00:01:59,869 --> 00:02:02,980
you need a base sheet here's the base
sheet folded in half crease really

64
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:02,990
sheet folded in half crease really

65
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:06,820
sheet folded in half crease really
thoroughly and then you need another

66
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:06,830
thoroughly and then you need another

67
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:10,930
thoroughly and then you need another
another piece about this big I've

68
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:10,940
another piece about this big I've

69
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:12,730
another piece about this big I've
actually already creased it in the

70
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:12,740
actually already creased it in the

71
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:14,740
actually already creased it in the
middle that way folded it really

72
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:14,750
middle that way folded it really

73
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:19,090
middle that way folded it really
thoroughly I've added a a crease at each

74
00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:19,100
thoroughly I've added a a crease at each

75
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:23,440
thoroughly I've added a a crease at each
end for gluing tags and then you want

76
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:23,450
end for gluing tags and then you want

77
00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:26,080
end for gluing tags and then you want
another crease going down the middle of

78
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:26,090
another crease going down the middle of

79
00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:29,020
another crease going down the middle of
it so you fold it lengthwise so make

80
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:29,030
it so you fold it lengthwise so make

81
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:31,030
it so you fold it lengthwise so make
sure this time make sure those two

82
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:31,040
sure this time make sure those two

83
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,460
sure this time make sure those two
central creases line up with each other

84
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:33,470
central creases line up with each other

85
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:35,949
central creases line up with each other
so that you know it's all going to work

86
00:02:35,949 --> 00:02:35,959
so that you know it's all going to work

87
00:02:35,959 --> 00:02:39,850
so that you know it's all going to work
nicely so there's the there's that

88
00:02:39,850 --> 00:02:39,860
nicely so there's the there's that

89
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:42,430
nicely so there's the there's that
crease fold it back on it so fold it

90
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:42,440
crease fold it back on it so fold it

91
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:46,900
crease fold it back on it so fold it
really thoroughly so you've got you've

92
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:46,910
really thoroughly so you've got you've

93
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:48,610
really thoroughly so you've got you've
got a cross shape now you actually need

94
00:02:48,610 --> 00:02:48,620
got a cross shape now you actually need

95
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:50,770
got a cross shape now you actually need
two more creases going across like this

96
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:50,780
two more creases going across like this

97
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:54,220
two more creases going across like this
so one way is to just fold it across and

98
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:54,230
so one way is to just fold it across and

99
00:02:54,230 --> 00:02:57,400
so one way is to just fold it across and
bring the creasing lines so you can do

100
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:57,410
bring the creasing lines so you can do

101
00:02:57,410 --> 00:03:00,009
bring the creasing lines so you can do
it like that but that's one way of doing

102
00:03:00,009 --> 00:03:00,019
it like that but that's one way of doing

103
00:03:00,019 --> 00:03:03,280
it like that but that's one way of doing
it and fold that back on it so the other

104
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:03,290
it and fold that back on it so the other

105
00:03:03,290 --> 00:03:05,050
it and fold that back on it so the other
other ways if you find that really

106
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:05,060
other ways if you find that really

107
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:07,690
other ways if you find that really
difficult you can use a cassette square

108
00:03:07,690 --> 00:03:07,700
difficult you can use a cassette square

109
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:09,940
difficult you can use a cassette square
so the causes of the set square of 45

110
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:09,950
so the causes of the set square of 45

111
00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:11,710
so the causes of the set square of 45
degrees and what you're aiming for here

112
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:11,720
degrees and what you're aiming for here

113
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:13,600
degrees and what you're aiming for here
is 8 angles and they're all going to be

114
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:13,610
is 8 angles and they're all going to be

115
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:16,800
is 8 angles and they're all going to be
45 degrees so you can just put that down

116
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:16,810
45 degrees so you can just put that down

117
00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:19,990
45 degrees so you can just put that down
that central crease mark it with a

118
00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:20,000
that central crease mark it with a

119
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,870
that central crease mark it with a
pencil or score it with your bar oh so

120
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:22,880
pencil or score it with your bar oh so

121
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:25,449
pencil or score it with your bar oh so
there's one and then you can do the same

122
00:03:25,449 --> 00:03:25,459
there's one and then you can do the same

123
00:03:25,459 --> 00:03:31,720
there's one and then you can do the same
on the other side so that's the that's

124
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:31,730
on the other side so that's the that's

125
00:03:31,730 --> 00:03:34,420
on the other side so that's the that's
the line we want we won't fold it so now

126
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:34,430
the line we want we won't fold it so now

127
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:37,990
the line we want we won't fold it so now
you just fold it along there you can

128
00:03:37,990 --> 00:03:38,000
you just fold it along there you can

129
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,440
you just fold it along there you can
check it by just making sure that these

130
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:40,450
check it by just making sure that these

131
00:03:40,450 --> 00:03:43,870
check it by just making sure that these
these creases line up and they look the

132
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:43,880
these creases line up and they look the

133
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:48,520
these creases line up and they look the
early so that is a bit tricky it is a

134
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:48,530
early so that is a bit tricky it is a

135
00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:52,900
early so that is a bit tricky it is a
bit tricky but so that is you end up

136
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:52,910
bit tricky but so that is you end up

137
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:55,000
bit tricky but so that is you end up
with the with the creases all making a

138
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:55,010
with the with the creases all making a

139
00:03:55,010 --> 00:03:57,250
with the with the creases all making a
star shape and now you should be able to

140
00:03:57,250 --> 00:03:57,260
star shape and now you should be able to

141
00:03:57,260 --> 00:04:00,699
star shape and now you should be able to
push it in like that so this is the

142
00:04:00,699 --> 00:04:00,709
push it in like that so this is the

143
00:04:00,709 --> 00:04:04,210
push it in like that so this is the
shape you end up with and these these

144
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:04,220
shape you end up with and these these

145
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:06,129
shape you end up with and these these
two central creases should be flush with

146
00:04:06,129 --> 00:04:06,139
two central creases should be flush with

147
00:04:06,139 --> 00:04:06,939
two central creases should be flush with
each other

148
00:04:06,939 --> 00:04:06,949
each other

149
00:04:06,949 --> 00:04:09,490
each other
ideally there is a little bit of leeway

150
00:04:09,490 --> 00:04:09,500
ideally there is a little bit of leeway

151
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:10,210
ideally there is a little bit of leeway
but

152
00:04:10,210 --> 00:04:10,220
but

153
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:12,040
but
more flash they are with each other the

154
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:12,050
more flash they are with each other the

155
00:04:12,050 --> 00:04:14,680
more flash they are with each other the
better and then sometimes you can just

156
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:14,690
better and then sometimes you can just

157
00:04:14,690 --> 00:04:17,110
better and then sometimes you can just
cut out that final point because there's

158
00:04:17,110 --> 00:04:17,120
cut out that final point because there's

159
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,670
cut out that final point because there's
a whole lot of cards all come together

160
00:04:18,670 --> 00:04:18,680
a whole lot of cards all come together

161
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:21,099
a whole lot of cards all come together
there and it makes it a little bit thick

162
00:04:21,099 --> 00:04:21,109
there and it makes it a little bit thick

163
00:04:21,109 --> 00:04:24,010
there and it makes it a little bit thick
so just to make it work a little more

164
00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:24,020
so just to make it work a little more

165
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:27,160
so just to make it work a little more
smoothly you can just cut that it off so

166
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:27,170
smoothly you can just cut that it off so

167
00:04:27,170 --> 00:04:29,790
smoothly you can just cut that it off so
this is the shape you've ended up with

168
00:04:29,790 --> 00:04:29,800
this is the shape you've ended up with

169
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:33,430
this is the shape you've ended up with
now you only want one tab on each end

170
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:33,440
now you only want one tab on each end

171
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:36,670
now you only want one tab on each end
and so make a tab on this end up here

172
00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:36,680
and so make a tab on this end up here

173
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:40,870
and so make a tab on this end up here
and just cut it back a bit further

174
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:40,880
and just cut it back a bit further

175
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,700
and just cut it back a bit further
rather than just cutting along the the

176
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:42,710
rather than just cutting along the the

177
00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:45,990
rather than just cutting along the the
crease there cut it back a bit bit more

178
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:46,000
crease there cut it back a bit bit more

179
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,860
crease there cut it back a bit bit more
otherwise you'll end up with a point

180
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:47,870
otherwise you'll end up with a point

181
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:50,140
otherwise you'll end up with a point
here which might snag on other things so

182
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:50,150
here which might snag on other things so

183
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:52,180
here which might snag on other things so
you just cut that off to the to the

184
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:52,190
you just cut that off to the to the

185
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:55,450
you just cut that off to the to the
corner take it off there so you've got a

186
00:04:55,450 --> 00:04:55,460
corner take it off there so you've got a

187
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:57,670
corner take it off there so you've got a
gluing tab off one end there and then

188
00:04:57,670 --> 00:04:57,680
gluing tab off one end there and then

189
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:00,100
gluing tab off one end there and then
the crucial thing is the other gluing

190
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:00,110
the crucial thing is the other gluing

191
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:02,470
the crucial thing is the other gluing
tab must be diagonally opposite not on

192
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:02,480
tab must be diagonally opposite not on

193
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:06,070
tab must be diagonally opposite not on
the same side so here's the second

194
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:06,080
the same side so here's the second

195
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:16,270
the same side so here's the second
gluing time this is the shape you want

196
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:16,280
gluing time this is the shape you want

197
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:18,430
gluing time this is the shape you want
to end up with and now you're going to

198
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:18,440
to end up with and now you're going to

199
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:21,010
to end up with and now you're going to
put the glue I'll need four central

200
00:05:21,010 --> 00:05:21,020
put the glue I'll need four central

201
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:23,640
put the glue I'll need four central
panels and that's all going to glue down

202
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:23,650
panels and that's all going to glue down

203
00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:28,090
panels and that's all going to glue down
flat with the central crease lined up at

204
00:05:28,090 --> 00:05:28,100
flat with the central crease lined up at

205
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:30,070
flat with the central crease lined up at
the at the central crease of the base

206
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:30,080
the at the central crease of the base

207
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,409
the at the central crease of the base
and these four glued down and you can

208
00:05:32,409 --> 00:05:32,419
and these four glued down and you can

209
00:05:32,419 --> 00:05:34,510
and these four glued down and you can
glue the whole thing can glue down flat

210
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:34,520
glue the whole thing can glue down flat

211
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:36,880
glue the whole thing can glue down flat
so you can put glue on all those four at

212
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:36,890
so you can put glue on all those four at

213
00:05:36,890 --> 00:05:40,900
so you can put glue on all those four at
the same time so just to make sure we

214
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:40,910
the same time so just to make sure we

215
00:05:40,910 --> 00:05:43,480
the same time so just to make sure we
don't miss the glue up which we fold it

216
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:43,490
don't miss the glue up which we fold it

217
00:05:43,490 --> 00:05:45,969
don't miss the glue up which we fold it
into that position it makes it easier to

218
00:05:45,969 --> 00:05:45,979
into that position it makes it easier to

219
00:05:45,979 --> 00:05:49,120
into that position it makes it easier to
get the glue up to the creases and not

220
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:49,130
get the glue up to the creases and not

221
00:05:49,130 --> 00:05:59,629
get the glue up to the creases and not
beyond

222
00:05:59,629 --> 00:05:59,639


223
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:06,089
right so open it up flat

224
00:06:06,089 --> 00:06:06,099
right so open it up flat

225
00:06:06,099 --> 00:06:08,189
right so open it up flat
central crease with the central crease

226
00:06:08,189 --> 00:06:08,199
central crease with the central crease

227
00:06:08,199 --> 00:06:14,399
central crease with the central crease
on the base and glue it down there is so

228
00:06:14,399 --> 00:06:14,409
on the base and glue it down there is so

229
00:06:14,409 --> 00:06:17,519
on the base and glue it down there is so
glue those down flat and now you close

230
00:06:17,519 --> 00:06:17,529
glue those down flat and now you close

231
00:06:17,529 --> 00:06:19,920
glue those down flat and now you close
it and these these two pieces they

232
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:19,930
it and these these two pieces they

233
00:06:19,930 --> 00:06:28,110
it and these these two pieces they
should lift up and come together so

234
00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:28,120
should lift up and come together so

235
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:30,439
should lift up and come together so
there as you can see the two V fonts

236
00:06:30,439 --> 00:06:30,449
there as you can see the two V fonts

237
00:06:30,449 --> 00:06:33,089
there as you can see the two V fonts
coming together as you open and close it

238
00:06:33,089 --> 00:06:33,099
coming together as you open and close it

239
00:06:33,099 --> 00:06:34,320
coming together as you open and close it
so now you're going to stick another

240
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:34,330
so now you're going to stick another

241
00:06:34,330 --> 00:06:38,219
so now you're going to stick another
piece across between these two let's try

242
00:06:38,219 --> 00:06:38,229
piece across between these two let's try

243
00:06:38,229 --> 00:06:39,809
piece across between these two let's try
a bit of red

244
00:06:39,809 --> 00:06:39,819
a bit of red

245
00:06:39,819 --> 00:06:41,850
a bit of red
we don't want it any wider than this

246
00:06:41,850 --> 00:06:41,860
we don't want it any wider than this

247
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:44,909
we don't want it any wider than this
piece we've already attached so aim for

248
00:06:44,909 --> 00:06:44,919
piece we've already attached so aim for

249
00:06:44,919 --> 00:06:56,249
piece we've already attached so aim for
the same with more or less and then it

250
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:56,259
the same with more or less and then it

251
00:06:56,259 --> 00:06:58,320
the same with more or less and then it
mustn't be shorter than the distance

252
00:06:58,320 --> 00:06:58,330
mustn't be shorter than the distance

253
00:06:58,330 --> 00:07:00,570
mustn't be shorter than the distance
between these two creases if it's

254
00:07:00,570 --> 00:07:00,580
between these two creases if it's

255
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:03,300
between these two creases if it's
shorter then the whole mechanism can't

256
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:03,310
shorter then the whole mechanism can't

257
00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:05,189
shorter then the whole mechanism can't
open it can be longer the longer it is

258
00:07:05,189 --> 00:07:05,199
open it can be longer the longer it is

259
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:08,999
open it can be longer the longer it is
the more it'll stand up so we start by

260
00:07:08,999 --> 00:07:09,009
the more it'll stand up so we start by

261
00:07:09,009 --> 00:07:12,149
the more it'll stand up so we start by
just folding it in the middle so you're

262
00:07:12,149 --> 00:07:12,159
just folding it in the middle so you're

263
00:07:12,159 --> 00:07:14,790
just folding it in the middle so you're
going to a crease across the middle like

264
00:07:14,790 --> 00:07:14,800
going to a crease across the middle like

265
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:21,300
going to a crease across the middle like
that and then this is going to fit in

266
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:21,310
that and then this is going to fit in

267
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:23,850
that and then this is going to fit in
like that so if we look at this it's

268
00:07:23,850 --> 00:07:23,860
like that so if we look at this it's

269
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:27,119
like that so if we look at this it's
about well we'll just take say a

270
00:07:27,119 --> 00:07:27,129
about well we'll just take say a

271
00:07:27,129 --> 00:07:29,610
about well we'll just take say a
centimeter off each end so fold it in

272
00:07:29,610 --> 00:07:29,620
centimeter off each end so fold it in

273
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:30,110
centimeter off each end so fold it in
half

274
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:30,120
half

275
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:33,089
half
keeping it symmetrical we can just take

276
00:07:33,089 --> 00:07:33,099
keeping it symmetrical we can just take

277
00:07:33,099 --> 00:07:35,999
keeping it symmetrical we can just take
a piece off like that this is going to

278
00:07:35,999 --> 00:07:36,009
a piece off like that this is going to

279
00:07:36,009 --> 00:07:39,269
a piece off like that this is going to
glue into in this position and so these

280
00:07:39,269 --> 00:07:39,279
glue into in this position and so these

281
00:07:39,279 --> 00:07:41,639
glue into in this position and so these
tabs they can either go on top which

282
00:07:41,639 --> 00:07:41,649
tabs they can either go on top which

283
00:07:41,649 --> 00:07:43,230
tabs they can either go on top which
case they're visible or you can hide

284
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:43,240
case they're visible or you can hide

285
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:45,360
case they're visible or you can hide
them underneath so we put them

286
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:45,370
them underneath so we put them

287
00:07:45,370 --> 00:07:53,070
them underneath so we put them
underneath

288
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:53,080


289
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:56,950
okay make sure the edge is flush with

290
00:07:56,950 --> 00:07:56,960
okay make sure the edge is flush with

291
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:00,120
okay make sure the edge is flush with
the grease and then that one goes there

292
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:00,130
the grease and then that one goes there

293
00:08:00,130 --> 00:08:04,480
the grease and then that one goes there
you can shut the base and made it all a

294
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:04,490
you can shut the base and made it all a

295
00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:07,600
you can shut the base and made it all a
bit big so it's just enough that's the

296
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:07,610
bit big so it's just enough that's the

297
00:08:07,610 --> 00:08:09,520
bit big so it's just enough that's the
way it goes with dummies so you make the

298
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:09,530
way it goes with dummies so you make the

299
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:11,500
way it goes with dummies so you make the
dummy and then you see the dimensions

300
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:11,510
dummy and then you see the dimensions

301
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:13,750
dummy and then you see the dimensions
and you can see what you grow you need

302
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:13,760
and you can see what you grow you need

303
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:16,030
and you can see what you grow you need
to change so this is the dummy of the

304
00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:16,040
to change so this is the dummy of the

305
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:24,310
to change so this is the dummy of the
twisting mechanism so this is Little Red

306
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:24,320

00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:54,070
night before Christmas by Roberts óbuda
and under this flap you have a really

328
00:08:54,070 --> 00:08:54,080
and under this flap you have a really

329
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,600
and under this flap you have a really
amazing example of the twisting

330
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:55,610
amazing example of the twisting

331
00:08:55,610 --> 00:08:58,900
amazing example of the twisting
mechanism so who is opens up and he's

332
00:08:58,900 --> 00:08:58,910
mechanism so who is opens up and he's

333
00:08:58,910 --> 00:09:02,110
mechanism so who is opens up and he's
got all the six planes or at least five

334
00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:02,120
got all the six planes or at least five

335
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:03,880
got all the six planes or at least five
of them have been extended with these

336
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:03,890
of them have been extended with these

337
00:09:03,890 --> 00:09:07,960
of them have been extended with these
these cutouts so as the flap opens and

338
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:07,970
these cutouts so as the flap opens and

339
00:09:07,970 --> 00:09:11,079
these cutouts so as the flap opens and
closes so you see it the whole gang of

340
00:09:11,079 --> 00:09:11,089
closes so you see it the whole gang of

341
00:09:11,089 --> 00:09:13,420
closes so you see it the whole gang of
deer reindeer they all put me a

342
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:13,430
deer reindeer they all put me a

343
00:09:13,430 --> 00:09:16,510
deer reindeer they all put me a
pirouette around the action very nice

344
00:09:16,510 --> 00:09:16,520
pirouette around the action very nice

345
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:22,269
pirouette around the action very nice
example and then the next one is the

346
00:09:22,269 --> 00:09:22,279
example and then the next one is the

347
00:09:22,279 --> 00:09:25,960
example and then the next one is the
Nutcracker by Nick Dench filled this has

348
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:25,970
Nutcracker by Nick Dench filled this has

349
00:09:25,970 --> 00:09:28,660
Nutcracker by Nick Dench filled this has
got an unusual variation he's using the

350
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:28,670
got an unusual variation he's using the

351
00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:30,160
got an unusual variation he's using the
twisting mechanism to raise the

352
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:30,170
twisting mechanism to raise the

353
00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:31,920
twisting mechanism to raise the
Christmas tree so this is actually a

354
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:31,930
Christmas tree so this is actually a

355
00:09:31,930 --> 00:09:34,900
Christmas tree so this is actually a
solid shape being lifted rather than

356
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:34,910
solid shape being lifted rather than

357
00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:39,310
solid shape being lifted rather than
just a couple of planes so you can see a

358
00:09:39,310 --> 00:09:39,320
just a couple of planes so you can see a

359
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:42,880
just a couple of planes so you can see a
nun you can see the see the v-folds

360
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:42,890
nun you can see the see the v-folds

361
00:09:42,890 --> 00:09:45,670
nun you can see the see the v-folds
going down again coming together and

362
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:45,680
going down again coming together and

363
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:47,320
going down again coming together and
holding away in the Christmas tree

364
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:47,330
holding away in the Christmas tree

365
00:09:47,330 --> 00:09:50,170
holding away in the Christmas tree
spinning around so the last one I want

366
00:09:50,170 --> 00:09:50,180
spinning around so the last one I want

367
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:52,750
spinning around so the last one I want
to show you is my jungle pop-up book and

368
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:52,760
to show you is my jungle pop-up book and

369
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:54,820
to show you is my jungle pop-up book and
this has a really interesting variation

370
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:54,830
this has a really interesting variation

371
00:09:54,830 --> 00:09:59,949
this has a really interesting variation
so here it is and in this case the

372
00:09:59,949 --> 00:09:59,959
so here it is and in this case the

373
00:09:59,959 --> 00:10:02,050
so here it is and in this case the
v-folds don't lie flap when the page is

374
00:10:02,050 --> 00:10:02,060
v-folds don't lie flap when the page is

375
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:04,120
v-folds don't lie flap when the page is
flat they stand up and it's the piece

376
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:04,130
flat they stand up and it's the piece

377
00:10:04,130 --> 00:10:05,560
flat they stand up and it's the piece
lifting up on the top

378
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:05,570
lifting up on the top

379
00:10:05,570 --> 00:10:08,230
lifting up on the top
ends up flat rather than being a high

380
00:10:08,230 --> 00:10:08,240
ends up flat rather than being a high

381
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:11,590
ends up flat rather than being a high
right you know pointing up parallel fold

382
00:10:11,590 --> 00:10:11,600
right you know pointing up parallel fold

383
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:14,530
right you know pointing up parallel fold
so it folds down in between those two

384
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:14,540
so it folds down in between those two

385
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:18,610
so it folds down in between those two
V's so yeah a nice example there and

386
00:10:18,610 --> 00:10:18,620
V's so yeah a nice example there and

387
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:21,160
V's so yeah a nice example there and
that's it for twisting mechanism it's

388
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:21,170
that's it for twisting mechanism it's

389
00:10:21,170 --> 00:10:23,949
that's it for twisting mechanism it's
all explained in more detail in my book

390
00:10:23,949 --> 00:10:23,959
all explained in more detail in my book

391
00:10:23,959 --> 00:10:57,840
all explained in more detail in my book
pop-up design and paper mechanics

392
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:57,850
