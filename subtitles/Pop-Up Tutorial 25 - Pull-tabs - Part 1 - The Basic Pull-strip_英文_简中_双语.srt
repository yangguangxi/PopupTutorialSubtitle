然后在页面上切开缝

17
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:57,910
basic so here's another example that's
easier to see than the other one here
他们控制着方向

18
00:00:57,910 --> 00:00:57,920
easier to see than the other one here
缝隙的运动你也有一个标签

现在在一起，你可以看到它如何

27
00:01:07,790 --> 00:01:10,420
strip itself and then the direction of
movement is governed by these two
实际去

28
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:10,430
movement is governed by these two
这些都用卷尺测量，所以我不得不

29
00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:12,520
movement is governed by these two
sleeves I'll explain those in a minute
测量并事先准备

30
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:12,530
sleeves I'll explain those in a minute
而不是袖手旁观

31
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:15,399
sleeves I'll explain those in a minute
and this slit the slit in the page so
这是实际的地带

32
00:01:15,399 --> 00:01:15,409
and this slit the slit in the page so
这两个图像要去哪里

33
00:01:15,409 --> 00:01:16,899
and this slit the slit in the page so
they control the direction of the
使地带强记下来

34
00:01:16,899 --> 00:01:16,909
they control the direction of the
中间然后折痕而不是

35
00:01:16,909 --> 00:01:19,359
they control the direction of the
movement of the slit you also have a tab
只是将两块层压在一起

36
00:01:19,359 --> 00:01:19,369
movement of the slit you also have a tab
有折痕然后粘上你

37
00:01:19,369 --> 00:01:22,000
movement of the slit you also have a tab
that controls the amount of movement of
如果只是，则获得更强的剥离

38
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:22,010
that controls the amount of movement of
然后拉就没关系了

39
00:01:22,010 --> 00:01:24,940
that controls the amount of movement of
this strip and you can either have one
单一厚度的卡片，但是因为您

40
00:01:24,940 --> 00:01:24,950
this strip and you can either have one
将不得不拉它，推你

41
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:26,830
this strip and you can either have one
built in like I've done here or you can
希望它真的粘在一起

42
00:01:26,830 --> 00:01:26,840
built in like I've done here or you can
否则会弯曲

43
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:28,570
built in like I've done here or you can
actually just stick a piece of card
所以这是你的拉力条，我会粘上它

44
00:01:28,570 --> 00:01:28,580
actually just stick a piece of card
一起吧

45
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:31,210
actually just stick a piece of card
across like that so that as you pull it
这是要去的工作表

46
00:01:31,210 --> 00:01:31,220
across like that so that as you pull it
在上面，所以我已经在其中切开了窗户

47
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:32,890
across like that so that as you pull it
it'll move along and come up against
这些是两个地方

48
00:01:32,890 --> 00:01:32,900
it'll move along and come up against
袖子要适合这是

49
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:35,260
it'll move along and come up against
this slit in the page I'll put one
切开东西通过，所以我会

50
00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:35,270
this slit in the page I'll put one
剪掉其中一个时就剪一下

51
00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:37,270
this slit in the page I'll put one
together now so you can see how it
缝隙将其削减了几个MIL

52
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:37,280
together now so you can see how it
两端，以便卡可以抬起

53
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:41,590
together now so you can see how it
actually goes
如此轻微地上升

54


整个事情要动得多

55
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:44,600
these do tape measuring so I've had to
容易，所以这些就是你的袖子

56
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:44,610
these do tape measuring so I've had to
两个折痕使每个折痕一个

57
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:46,700
these do tape measuring so I've had to
measure it and prepare it beforehand
图像的窗口侧面

58
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:46,710
measure it and prepare it beforehand
将会出现，所以折痕这些

59
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:48,649
measure it and prepare it beforehand
rather than just doing it off the cuff
很好地把它粘下来，但是这些你

60
00:01:48,649 --> 00:01:48,659
rather than just doing it off the cuff
不需要太多胶水，或者您想要

61
00:01:48,659 --> 00:01:51,830
rather than just doing it off the cuff
here this is the actual strip this is
像这样粘着的任何东西

62
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:51,840
here this is the actual strip this is
需要确保您让它干燥，因为

63
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,440
here this is the actual strip this is
where the two images are going to go to
如果渗出的胶确实粘了

64
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:54,450
where the two images are going to go to
工作，事情做得不好

65
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:56,899
where the two images are going to go to
make the strip strong score it down the
这是一个袖子，这是另一个

66
00:01:56,899 --> 00:01:56,909
make the strip strong score it down the
我已经在需要的地方评分了

67
00:01:56,909 --> 00:01:59,600
make the strip strong score it down the
middle then crease it so rather than
折叠，然后添加胶水

68
00:01:59,600 --> 00:01:59,610
middle then crease it so rather than
粘在小卡片上而不是

69
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:02,240
middle then crease it so rather than
just laminating two pieces together by
大一个，所以这个袖子很小

70
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:02,250
just laminating two pieces together by
底座很大，所以你把

71
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:05,120
just laminating two pieces together by
having a crease and then gluing it you
将胶水粘在套筒上

72
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:05,130
having a crease and then gluing it you
现在，如果我们看看拉线

73
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:08,300
having a crease and then gluing it you
get a far stronger strip if it was just
本身将适合这种方式

74
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:08,310
get a far stronger strip if it was just
你会发现这些袖子必须

75
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:10,309
get a far stronger strip if it was just
pulling then it doesn't matter if it's
比...宽几毫米

76
00:02:10,309 --> 00:02:10,319
pulling then it doesn't matter if it's
条本身在每一侧，所以他们

77
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:12,050
pulling then it doesn't matter if it's
single thickness card but because you're
实际上并没有抓住它，所以他们要去

78
00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:12,060
single thickness card but because you're
当您关闭它时可以像这样折叠

79
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:14,330
single thickness card but because you're
going to have to pull it and push it you
下来，您只需要最小的DAB

80
00:02:14,330 --> 00:02:14,340
going to have to pull it and push it you
胶水，所以我在这里戳一下

81
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:15,890
going to have to pull it and push it you
want it to be stuck together really
第一

82
00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:15,900
want it to be stuck together really
现在可以轻松轻松地移动了

83
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:18,050
want it to be stuck together really
strong otherwise it will tend to buckle
此面朝下放下最小

84
00:02:18,050 --> 00:02:18,060
strong otherwise it will tend to buckle
胶水轻轻一点，所以没有压力

85
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:21,620
strong otherwise it will tend to buckle
so this is your pull strip I'll glue it
它不需要太多的胶水

86
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:21,630
so this is your pull strip I'll glue it
是它不会渗出和粘在

87
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:32,309
so this is your pull strip I'll glue it
together right
工作，所以这是一个袖子，这是

88

118
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:18,609
quite well glue it down but these you
所以只要拿一张卡得分

119
00:03:18,609 --> 00:03:20,429
quite well glue it down but these you
don't want too much glue or you want to

00:03:24,179 --> 00:03:24,189
need to make sure you let it dry because
这次用尺子真的让我

125
00:03:24,189 --> 00:03:26,940
need to make sure you let it dry because
if the glue oozing it does gum up the

if the glue oozing it does gum up the
三毫米宽再切

127
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:28,860
if the glue oozing it does gum up the
works and things don't work so well so
剪掉，然后你要

128
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:28,870
works and things don't work so well so
最后需要一个缝所以

129
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:32,159
works and things don't work so well so
that's one sleeve this is the other
从那有多宽和公正来判断

130
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:32,169
that's one sleeve this is the other
这样碰到两个

131
00:03:32,169 --> 00:03:35,399
that's one sleeve this is the other
I've already scored it where it needs to
小削减，现在到关键

132
00:03:35,399 --> 00:03:35,409
I've already scored it where it needs to
你只需要一块这样的东西

133
00:03:35,409 --> 00:03:38,490
I've already scored it where it needs to
fold and you're adding glue always put
您将其粘贴到所需的拉条上

134
00:03:38,490 --> 00:03:38,500
fold and you're adding glue always put
进来闭嘴，你要

135

glue on the small piece of card not the
有两个这样的小块

136
00:03:40,199 --> 00:03:40,209
glue on the small piece of card not the
通过插槽关闭，所以这是

137
00:03:40,209 --> 00:03:42,599
glue on the small piece of card not the
big one so this sleeve is the small bit
另一边，是的，所以这两个目的

138
00:03:42,599 --> 00:03:42,609
big one so this sleeve is the small bit
将通过插槽站起来

139
00:03:42,609 --> 00:03:44,640
big one so this sleeve is the small bit
and the base is the big bit so you put
我们也会把那些胶粘下来

140
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:44,650
and the base is the big bit so you put
在这下面放些胶水

141
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:49,259
and the base is the big bit so you put
the glue onto the sleeve stick it in
