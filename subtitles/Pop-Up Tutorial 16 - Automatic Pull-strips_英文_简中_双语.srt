00:00:36,789 --> 00:00:39,389
this tutorial is about automatic bull
strips the principle is that you have a
卡条，它粘在一侧

4
00:00:39,389 --> 00:00:39,399
strips the principle is that you have a
当页面打开时，该条跨过

5
00:00:39,399 --> 00:00:41,819
strips the principle is that you have a
strip of card and it's stuck to one side
另一页上下翻页

6
00:00:41,819 --> 00:00:41,829
strip of card and it's stuck to one side
当页面打开时，它将拉动该条

7
00:00:41,829 --> 00:00:45,029
strip of card and it's stuck to one side
as the page opens this strip goes across
因此，这一前进的方向可以是

8
00:00:45,029 --> 00:00:45,039
as the page opens this strip goes across
用来使其弯曲成弓形

9
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:48,899
as the page opens this strip goes across
the other page under and out again and
抬起皮瓣抬起平行四边形

10
00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:48,909
the other page under and out again and
你知道它具有所有这些用途，所以我会

11
00:00:48,909 --> 00:00:51,809
the other page under and out again and
as the page opens it pulls that strip
给你看其他例子

12
00:00:51,809 --> 00:00:51,819
as the page opens it pulls that strip
这是一个正在鞠躬的人

13
00:00:51,819 --> 00:00:54,899
as the page opens it pulls that strip
and so this end that's moving can be
形状，在这种情况下，

14
00:00:54,899 --> 00:00:54,909
and so this end that's moving can be
那就是把它拉到下面

15
00:00:54,909 --> 00:00:56,910
and so this end that's moving can be
used to make it raise up a bowing shape
你下台的边缘，它走了

16
00:00:56,910 --> 00:00:56,920
used to make it raise up a bowing shape
通过那里下面的一个插槽，但是

17
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:59,879
used to make it raise up a bowing shape
raise up a flap raise up a parallelogram
实际上并没有进入哪个页面

18
00:00:59,879 --> 00:00:59,889
raise up a flap raise up a parallelogram
意味着这边这边可能会趋向

19
00:00:59,889 --> 00:01:03,930
raise up a flap raise up a parallelogram
you know it has all these uses so I'll
举起一点，但在这个例子中

20
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:03,940
you know it has all these uses so I'll
它实际上表现得很好

21
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:06,660
you know it has all these uses so I'll
show you examples of these other ones so
另一个例子是如果

22
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:06,670
show you examples of these other ones so
你这样看就可以看

23
00:01:06,670 --> 00:01:09,630
show you examples of these other ones so
here's one this is raising up a bow in
确实进入页面下方并出来

24
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:09,640
here's one this is raising up a bow in
再次，这提起这瓣

25
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:13,170
here's one this is raising up a bow in
shape and in this case that the strip
然后举起平行四边形，然后

26
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:13,180
shape and in this case that the strip
在这个例子中，这就是拉

27
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:15,090
shape and in this case that the strip
that's pulling it just goes underneath
带拉起这种弓形和

28
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:15,100
that's pulling it just goes underneath
因为它是弯曲的形状

29
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:17,969
that's pulling it just goes underneath
this edge you step down and it goes
将笔直的卡片粘贴到

30
00:01:17,969 --> 00:01:17,979
this edge you step down and it goes
曲线上的不同点

31
00:01:17,979 --> 00:01:20,130
this edge you step down and it goes
through a slot underneath there but it
都会以不同的角度抬起

32
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:20,140
through a slot underneath there but it
我再给你看一个例子

33
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:22,499
through a slot underneath there but it
doesn't actually go under the page which
最简单的机制

34
00:01:22,499 --> 00:01:22,509
doesn't actually go under the page which
这是David Pellom和

35
00:01:22,509 --> 00:01:25,080
doesn't actually go under the page which
means this end this side here can tend
当你打开这个

36
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:25,090
means this end this side here can tend
它拉动了假价格，所以现在我们

37
00:01:25,090 --> 00:01:27,810
means this end this side here can tend
to lift up a bit but in this example
只是使最简单的一种，所以你会

38
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:27,820
to lift up a bit but in this example
需要像这样的基础表

39
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:31,139
to lift up a bit but in this example
it's actually behaving pretty well this
将它折成两半

40
00:01:31,139 --> 00:01:31,149
it's actually behaving pretty well this
完全正确，不要再张纸

41
00:01:31,149 --> 00:01:33,569
it's actually behaving pretty well this
is another example here's the strip if
卡，然后将其切成两半

42
00:01:33,569 --> 00:01:33,579
is another example here's the strip if
纵向画几张

43
00:01:33,579 --> 00:01:35,249
is another example here's the strip if
you look at it this way you can see it
准则使用标尺绘制

44
00:01:35,249 --> 00:01:35,259
you look at it this way you can see it
几个平行的引导线沿着

45
00:01:35,259 --> 00:01:36,840
you look at it this way you can see it
does go under the page and come out
它的长度将标尺放在中间

46
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:36,850
does go under the page and come out
对于两个准则

47
00:01:36,850 --> 00:01:39,090
does go under the page and come out
again and that lifts this flap which
现在将标签页夹到一端，这是一个

48
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:39,100
again and that lifts this flap which
粘贴标签，所以大约半英寸

49
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:42,330
again and that lifts this flap which
then lifts this parallelogram and then
宽或一厘米的折叠

50
00:01:42,330 --> 00:01:42,340
then lifts this parallelogram and then
另一端剪掉大约一英寸

51
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:48,120
then lifts this parallelogram and then
in this example here is this is the pull
两个半厘米的东西

52
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:48,130
in this example here is this is the pull
像那样稍微缩短一点

53
00:01:48,130 --> 00:01:50,099
in this example here is this is the pull
strip pulling up this bowing shape and
并在其上折叠粘合标签

54
00:01:50,099 --> 00:01:50,109
strip pulling up this bowing shape and
就像现在把你的基础表放一个

55
00:01:50,109 --> 00:01:51,630
strip pulling up this bowing shape and
because it's a curved shape you can
对折起名字，就像

56
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:51,640
because it's a curved shape you can
这是中央沟

57
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:54,690
because it's a curved shape you can
stick straight pieces of card onto it at
基本表，然后将其折叠，因此

58
00:01:54,690 --> 00:01:54,700
stick straight pieces of card onto it at
就在卡的外边缘内

59
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:56,849
stick straight pieces of card onto it at
different points on the curve and they
这样当东西平的时候

60
00:01:56,849 --> 00:01:56,859
different points on the curve and they
它不只是现在不在

61
00:01:56,859 --> 00:02:01,010
different points on the curve and they
will all lift up at different angles so
长边这是条带去的地方

62
00:02:01,010 --> 00:02:01,020
will all lift up at different angles so
要在这个长边上画一个

63
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:03,539
will all lift up at different angles so
I'll just show you one more example of
小指南再次在这里

I'll just show you one more example of
一厘米可以帮助整个

65
00:02:03,549 --> 00:02:05,940
I'll just show you one more example of
the mechanism this is the most simple
坚持不动，东西移动会更顺畅

66
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:05,950
the mechanism this is the most simple
在一起

as you open this
行，以便您正在制作的条带是

71
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:23,580
as you open this
it pulls the fake price across so now we
只是会比

72
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:23,590
it pulls the fake price across so now we
您绘制的指导线，然后

73
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:25,949
it pulls the fake price across so now we
just make the simplest kind so you'll
沿着第二个第二指南

74
00:02:25,949 --> 00:02:25,959
just make the simplest kind so you'll
现在另一端拿出一个

75
00:02:25,959 --> 00:02:30,330
just make the simplest kind so you'll
need a base sheet something like this
介于两个准则之间

76
00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:30,340
need a base sheet something like this
这一个你开始只吃一顿饭

77
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:33,570
need a base sheet something like this
fold it in half crease it really
或折线上方1毫米，

78
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:33,580
fold it in half crease it really
带到外面一毫米或两毫米

79
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:43,710
fold it in half crease it really
thoroughly right no take another sheet
准则，因此您的范围更广

80
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:43,720
thoroughly right no take another sheet
现在，您可以调整一下缝隙

81
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:46,130
thoroughly right no take another sheet
of card and just cut it in half
所有这些粘贴选项卡

82
00:02:46,130 --> 00:02:46,140
of card and just cut it in half
弯道好了，现在将其折叠

83
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:53,670
of card and just cut it in half
lengthways so draw a couple of
这是你的那条折痕

84
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:53,680
lengthways so draw a couple of
仅此折叠结束，并确保

85
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,470
lengthways so draw a couple of
guidelines use your ruler to draw a
拉条紧贴的

86
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:55,480
guidelines use your ruler to draw a

00:02:57,550 --> 00:03:02,840
couple of parallel guide lines down the
length of it put the ruler in the middle
这两个选项卡激活将其放置在

90


的地方，所以你有最尖端的

91
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:15,360
for the two guidelines
拉条的中央

92


现在这两个标签在沟渠下折叠

93
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:19,030
now folder a tab on to one end this is a
你把胶水粘在它们上

94
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:19,040
now folder a tab on to one end this is a
同时，他们将成为

95
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:21,100
now folder a tab on to one end this is a
gluing tab so it's about half an inch
像这样折叠在下面

96
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:21,110
gluing tab so it's about half an inch
他们都是这个机制的所有标签

97
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:26,380
gluing tab so it's about half an inch
wide or one centimeter fold that really
承受很大的压力，所以请确保

98
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:26,390
wide or one centimeter fold that really
胶水直达折痕

99
00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:32,340
wide or one centimeter fold that really
well the other end cut off about an inch
而且你知道那里很好

100
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:32,350
well the other end cut off about an inch
粘在下面

101
00:03:32,350 --> 00:03:35,020
well the other end cut off about an inch
two and a half centimeters something
拉带紧贴脊柱

102
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:35,030
two and a half centimeters something
按下它就可以了

103
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:37,480
two and a half centimeters something
like that just make it slightly shorter
它正在工作，您现在就可以

104
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:37,490
like that just make it slightly shorter
只需拉一下并确保它是

105
00:03:37,490 --> 00:03:49,320
like that just make it slightly shorter
and fold a gluing tab on to that as well
举起好吧，所以举起所有

106


现在，您将胶水平放在标签上

107
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:54,550
like now take your base sheet put one
您将胶水放在标签的顶部

108
00:03:54,550 --> 00:03:54,560
like now take your base sheet put one
标签确实需要很大的压力，所以

109
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:57,280
like now take your base sheet put one
name against the crease so it's like
确保这是很好的胶合

110
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:57,290
name against the crease so it's like
现在您可以关闭底座了

111
00:03:57,290 --> 00:03:59,020
name against the crease so it's like
this here's the central gully of the
会发现其自然黏附

112
00:03:59,020 --> 00:03:59,030
this here's the central gully of the
位置给胶水片刻

113
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:03,699
this here's the central gully of the
base sheet and now fold it over so it's
去然后打开它，所以有

114
00:04:03,699 --> 00:04:03,709
base sheet and now fold it over so it's
你鞠躬的事，然后是的，如果你

115
00:04:03,709 --> 00:04:09,180
base sheet and now fold it over so it's
just within the outer edge of the card
希望您可以将碎片粘贴到此

116


所以你可以看到不同的角度

117
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:12,250
so that when the when the thing is flat
根据你坚持的地方举起来

118
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:12,260
so that when the when the thing is flat
他们，你可以坚持他们

119
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:17,500
so that when the when the thing is flat
it doesn't doesn't just out now on the
但如果你坚持下去

120
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:17,510
it doesn't doesn't just out now on the
这样的一面，他们

121
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:19,120
it doesn't doesn't just out now on the
long side this is where the strips going
更可能扑向基地

122
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:19,130
long side this is where the strips going
当它关闭时，最简单的方法是

123
00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:21,039
long side this is where the strips going
to be on this long side just draw a
让他们这样走，你

124
00:04:21,039 --> 00:04:21,049
to be on this long side just draw a
这些只需要一点胶水

125
00:04:21,049 --> 00:04:22,690
to be on this long side just draw a
little guideline here again it's about
根本不用承受任何压力，所以有

126
00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:22,700
little guideline here again it's about
一棒一顶

127
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:25,930
little guideline here again it's about
one centimeter in this helps the whole
坚持一个完全不同的角度

128
00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:25,940
one centimeter in this helps the whole
你可以坚持一半，这样你就可以

129
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:27,640
one centimeter in this helps the whole
thing move more smoothly when you stick
看到那是你真正看到的

130
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:27,650
thing move more smoothly when you stick
飞机，然后如您所见，我已经完成了

131
00:04:27,650 --> 00:04:28,500
thing move more smoothly when you stick
it together
这个粗糙的地方有点低，所以他们出去了

132
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:28,510
it together
你在这里也有沟壑，所以你可以

133
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:31,659
it together
now take a craft knife or scissors and
您可以在今天粘贴其他弹出式窗口，以便

134
00:04:31,659 --> 00:04:31,669
now take a craft knife or scissors and
在这里，我们有帮助动物的

00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:39,159
millimeters on the inside of these guide
lines so that the strip you're making is
当它关闭时，打开并关闭那些

140
00:04:39,159 --> 00:04:39,169
lines so that the strip you're making is
所有下一个都以不同的角度抬起

141
00:04:39,169 --> 00:04:42,159
lines so that the strip you're making is
just going to be slightly narrower than
一个是一分钱的飞行器

142
00:04:42,159 --> 00:04:42,169
just going to be slightly narrower than
这是价差，所以这是

143
00:04:42,169 --> 00:04:48,100
just going to be slightly narrower than
the guide lines you've drawn and then
曲线形状这是它粘贴的条

144
