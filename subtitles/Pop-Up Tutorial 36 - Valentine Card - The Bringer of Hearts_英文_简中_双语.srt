我将向您展示如何制作

3
00:00:33,989 --> 00:00:36,059
I'm going to show you how to make a
情人卡，在这种情况下是

4
00:00:36,059 --> 00:00:36,069
I'm going to show you how to make a
图飞跃而图是

5
00:00:36,069 --> 00:00:38,450
I'm going to show you how to make a
Valentine card which in this case is a
会抱着几个心

6
00:00:38,450 --> 00:00:38,460
Valentine card which in this case is a
所以这是基于平行四边形

7
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:41,639
Valentine card which in this case is a
figure leaping up and the the figure is
这是教程五，有几个

8
00:00:41,639 --> 00:00:41,649
figure leaping up and the the figure is
我到这里的其他例子中

9
00:00:41,649 --> 00:00:43,319
figure leaping up and the the figure is
going to be holding a couple of hearts
在我开始之前告诉你

10
00:00:43,319 --> 00:00:43,329
going to be holding a couple of hearts
另一个拿着球或其他东西

11
00:00:43,329 --> 00:00:45,750
going to be holding a couple of hearts
so this is based on the parallelogram
但是我们要让它成为一颗心

12
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:45,760
so this is based on the parallelogram
其实你可以玩这个，你可以

13
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:49,410
so this is based on the parallelogram
which is tutorial five there's a couple
有一个以上的数字，所以这是

14
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:49,420
which is tutorial five there's a couple
两个数字的另一个例子是

15
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:50,819
which is tutorial five there's a couple
of other examples I've got here I'll
仍然基于的基本原理

16
00:00:50,819 --> 00:00:50,829
of other examples I've got here I'll
我觉得这个平行四边形很

17
00:00:50,829 --> 00:00:53,369
of other examples I've got here I'll
just show you before I start here's
真正令人愉悦的是从基本卡开始

18
00:00:53,369 --> 00:00:53,379
just show you before I start here's
这是完全折痕的基础，

19
00:00:53,379 --> 00:00:55,709
just show you before I start here's
another one holding a ball or something
然后这是我们想要的另一块

20
00:00:55,709 --> 00:00:55,719
another one holding a ball or something
适合与背景融合

21
00:00:55,719 --> 00:00:57,829
another one holding a ball or something
but we're going to make it a heart and
我会做一个很小的

22
00:00:57,829 --> 00:00:57,839
but we're going to make it a heart and
这样的平行四边形在这里

23
00:00:57,839 --> 00:01:00,419
but we're going to make it a heart and
actually you can play with this you can
折叠在一端的标签中，然后我们

24
00:01:00,419 --> 00:01:00,429
actually you can play with this you can
来像这样的东西

25
00:01:00,429 --> 00:01:02,610
actually you can play with this you can
have more than one figure so here's
折起然后短距离

26
00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:02,620
have more than one figure so here's
这样，然后我们将有一个

27
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:06,480
have more than one figure so here's
another example of two figures it's the
标签在另一端，所以这是标准的

28
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:06,490
another example of two figures it's the
平行四边形

29
00:01:06,490 --> 00:01:08,850
another example of two figures it's the
same basic principle it's still based on
对，然后加强这些

30
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:08,860
same basic principle it's still based on
折痕，所以一切都很好

31
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:11,130
same basic principle it's still based on
the parallelogram I find this quite
这个的关键是

32
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:11,140
the parallelogram I find this quite
平行四边形长边短边当

33
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:14,370
the parallelogram I find this quite
pleasing really start with a base card
底座是平的，平行四边形是

34
00:01:14,370 --> 00:01:14,380
pleasing really start with a base card
平，那里将有

35
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:18,029
pleasing really start with a base card
here's the base thoroughly creased and
这里和这里的两个小三角形和

36
00:01:18,029 --> 00:01:18,039
here's the base thoroughly creased and
这里和这里这是四肢

37
00:01:18,039 --> 00:01:20,760
here's the base thoroughly creased and
then here's another piece we want it to
适合，所以这是与

38
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:20,770
then here's another piece we want it to
三个折痕，然后在这里，我们

39
00:01:20,770 --> 00:01:22,770
then here's another piece we want it to
fit in to blend in with the background
不会像那样折叠它，我们会做

40
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:22,780
fit in to blend in with the background
当我们在这边也一样

41
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:25,830
fit in to blend in with the background
I'm just going to make quite a small
打开，我们有这四个小

42
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:25,840
I'm just going to make quite a small
三角形，所以我们只需确保

43
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:28,859
I'm just going to make quite a small
parallelogram like this piece here so
那真的是牧师，所以

44
00:01:28,859 --> 00:01:28,869
parallelogram like this piece here so
所有动作真的

45
00:01:28,869 --> 00:01:33,779
parallelogram like this piece here so
fold in a tab on one end and then we
甜美地被卡住

46
00:01:33,779 --> 00:01:33,789
fold in a tab on one end and then we
一起

47
00:01:33,789 --> 00:01:37,020
fold in a tab on one end and then we
come along something like that put a
现在，所有平行四边形都有

48
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:37,030
come along something like that put a
长边卡在短距离内

49
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:43,289
come along something like that put a
crease in it and then a short distance
脊椎，你有一个短边

50
00:01:43,289 --> 00:01:43,299
crease in it and then a short distance
距离很远

51
00:01:43,299 --> 00:01:48,029
crease in it and then a short distance
like that and then we're going to have a
脊椎，所以我拿铅笔，我会

52
00:01:48,029 --> 00:01:48,039
like that and then we're going to have a
只是在这里标记短边

53
00:01:48,039 --> 00:01:50,899
like that and then we're going to have a
tab on the other end so this is standard
弄皱的谎言就在那里，因为

54
00:01:50,899 --> 00:01:50,909
tab on the other end so this is standard
当基地

55
00:01:50,909 --> 00:02:02,670
tab on the other end so this is standard
parallelogram
是平的，我们不需要测量

56


另一端，所以我在上面放胶水

57
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:05,620
right and then just reinforce these
那是长的一面

58
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:05,630
right and then just reinforce these
平行四边形平行于

59
00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:10,380
right and then just reinforce these
creases so it all works really well so
脊柱，离它不远

60


将此面朝下粘贴，这样就可以

61
00:02:10,390 --> 00:02:13,150
the key to this one is this is the
平放下来实际上就是这样

62
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:13,160
the key to this one is this is the
圆形，因此将其折叠成封闭状态

63
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:16,030
the key to this one is this is the
parallelogram long side short side when
位置关闭它找到的基地

64
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:16,040
parallelogram long side short side when
它想要坚持，然后我们打开它

65
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:18,040
parallelogram long side short side when
the base is flat the parallelogram is
向上，当底座是

66
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:18,050
the base is flat the parallelogram is
平这里我们有这四个小

67
00:02:18,050 --> 00:02:19,600
the base is flat the parallelogram is
flat and there's there are going to have
三角形，这就是我们可以坚持的地方

68
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:19,610
flat and there's there are going to have
四肢，所以我会做一个系列

69
00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:21,370
flat and there's there are going to have
two little triangles here and here and
这块的四肢可以是

70
00:02:21,370 --> 00:02:21,380
two little triangles here and here and
棘手的是因为它们关闭时

71
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:23,080
two little triangles here and here and
here and here which is what the limbs
您朝着不同的方向移动

72
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:23,090
here and here which is what the limbs
可能需要玩转和量身定制

73
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:26,080
here and here which is what the limbs
fit onto so here's the piece with the
这些，以便在关闭时不会

74
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:26,090
fit onto so here's the piece with the
像这只手，你会看到有一点

75
00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:29,440
fit onto so here's the piece with the
three creases and then it's here we
那里的弯曲看起来

76
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:29,450
three creases and then it's here we
某些地方被它相对

77
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:35,770
three creases and then it's here we
won't fold it in like that and we'll do
页面关闭时的书脊或书脊

78
00:02:35,770 --> 00:02:35,780
won't fold it in like that and we'll do
所以你可能需要玩

79
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:40,479
won't fold it in like that and we'll do
the same on this side as well when we
这些找到适合你的

80
00:02:40,479 --> 00:02:40,489
the same on this side as well when we
在这个例子中，四肢处于

81
00:02:40,489 --> 00:02:43,330
the same on this side as well when we
open that up we've got these four little
不同的形式，所以这个就像你

82
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:43,340
open that up we've got these four little
关闭它，您可以看到这条腿的样子

83
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:46,300
open that up we've got these four little
triangles and so we just make sure
去有被绊倒的危险

84
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:46,310
triangles and so we just make sure
针对该页面，但可以，并且

85
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:49,210
triangles and so we just make sure
that's all really thoroughly priest so
已经很好地解决了，所以我只是

86
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:49,220
that's all really thoroughly priest so
从这四个四肢，所以我们去

87
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:50,560
that's all really thoroughly priest so
that all moves really
我要弯曲的腿

88
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:50,570
that all moves really
这些在这种情况下非常粗糙

89
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:53,110
that all moves really
sweetly when it comes to being stuck
所以这是一条腿，让我们做一点

90
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:53,120
sweetly when it comes to being stuck
更短，我们可以坚持下去

91
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,960
sweetly when it comes to being stuck
together
现在我在上面放一些胶水

92
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:54,970
together
三角形把腿伸进去，我会

93
00:02:54,970 --> 00:02:58,449
together
now with all parallelograms you have a
只要检查一下是否确实有效

94
00:02:58,449 --> 00:02:58,459
now with all parallelograms you have a
当页面关闭时，一个人的摇摆

95
00:02:58,459 --> 00:03:01,510
now with all parallelograms you have a
long side stuck over a short distance to
围绕页面，以便一个

96
00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:01,520
long side stuck over a short distance to
似乎还可以，但是如果这

97
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:03,310
long side stuck over a short distance to
the spine and you've got a short side
只是被困在这里

98
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:03,320
the spine and you've got a short side
认为我们可能会遇到麻烦，所以我

99
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:05,320
the spine and you've got a short side
which is stuck down a long distance from
要改变顶部的形状

100
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:05,330
which is stuck down a long distance from
腿，这样你就可以把它放下来

101
00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:08,650
which is stuck down a long distance from
the spine so I get the pencil and I'll
所以我要贴在那个角落

102
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:08,660
the spine so I get the pencil and I'll
现在我要在上面放一些胶水

103
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:12,610
the spine so I get the pencil and I'll
just mark the short side here where the
试试这个，这样你就可以看到

104
00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:12,620
just mark the short side here where the
其实不是我想做的

105
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:16,509
just mark the short side here where the
crease lies so that's there and because
我们将不得不改变这一点

106
00:03:16,509 --> 00:03:16,519
crease lies so that's there and because
离开并开始，所以这是腿

107
00:03:16,519 --> 00:03:18,940
crease lies so that's there and because
the whole thing goes flat when the base
没有像那样的工作

108
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:18,950
the whole thing goes flat when the base
而且那个没有用，所以让我们

109
00:03:18,950 --> 00:03:20,770
the whole thing goes flat when the base
is flat we don't need to measure the
看看这些我已经调整了

110
00:03:20,770 --> 00:03:20,780
is flat we don't need to measure the
多一点，多一点胶

111
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:34,470
is flat we don't need to measure the
other end so I put glue on there
回到那里再试一次

112


以这个角度出来是正确的

113
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,580
that's the long side of the
这次接近页面，是的，所以

114
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:36,590
that's the long side of the
那是四条腿，现在我们想要一个

115
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:39,580
that's the long side of the
parallelogram stuck down parallel to the
两臂，让我们来

116
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:39,590
parallelogram stuck down parallel to the
这样的事情我们真的不需要

117
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:41,589
parallelogram stuck down parallel to the
spine and just a short distance from it
太担心手了

118
00:03:41,589 --> 00:03:41,599
spine and just a short distance from it
因为它会拿着一些

119
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:45,880
spine and just a short distance from it
stick this side down so that should go
心，那只是

120
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:45,890
stick this side down so that should go
如果你看这些而他们卡住了

121
00:03:45,890 --> 00:03:48,940
stick this side down so that should go
flat down just actually do it this way
在小的一面，这件实际上是

122
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:48,950
flat down just actually do it this way
相对页面旋转，因此非常

123
00:03:48,950 --> 00:03:52,390
flat down just actually do it this way
round so folding it into its closed
实际上几乎没有机会

124
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:52,400
round so folding it into its closed
那里的问题

125
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:56,530
round so folding it into its closed
position close the base it finds where
这是那些坚持到这两个

126
00:03:56,530 --> 00:03:56,540
position close the base it finds where
长边的三角形

127
00:03:56,540 --> 00:04:00,790
position close the base it finds where
it wants to stick and then we open that
页面关闭，他们实际上翻转了

128
00:04:00,790 --> 00:04:00,800
it wants to stick and then we open that
那就是问题开始出现的地方

129
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:03,309
it wants to stick and then we open that
up and it goes flat when the base is
我们的肢体还可以，现在我们将

130
00:04:03,309 --> 00:04:03,319
up and it goes flat when the base is
再做一次，我会尽力做到的

131
00:04:03,319 --> 00:04:06,090
up and it goes flat when the base is
flat here we have these four little
像我这样有点角度

132
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:06,100
flat here we have these four little
认为从那看来似乎

133
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:08,949
flat here we have these four little
triangles and that's where we can stick
好的，这一个

134
00:04:08,949 --> 00:04:08,959
triangles and that's where we can stick
这样的东西

135
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:11,440
triangles and that's where we can stick
the limbs on so I'll just make a series
也许我只是尝试一下

136
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:11,450
the limbs on so I'll just make a series
将其关闭，看起来很好

137
00:04:11,450 --> 00:04:17,409
the limbs on so I'll just make a series
of limbs from this piece these can be
关于它不是很高兴，但

138
00:04:17,409 --> 00:04:17,419
of limbs from this piece these can be
还不错，然后我们需要一个头

139
00:04:17,419 --> 00:04:20,860
of limbs from this piece these can be
tricky because as it closes they all
我会做一些真正基本的事情

140
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:20,870
tricky because as it closes they all
这次不，我要改变它

141
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:23,170
tricky because as it closes they all
move in in different directions you
并把它放在这边，因为我们知道

142
00:04:23,170 --> 00:04:23,180
move in in different directions you
这边是安全的，它旋转

143
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:24,700
move in in different directions you
might need to play around and tailor
方式而不是翻转，所以我们知道

144
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:24,710
might need to play around and tailor
