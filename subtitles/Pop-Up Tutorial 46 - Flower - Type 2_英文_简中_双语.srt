我将向您展示如何制作

3
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:38,030
I'm going to show you how to make an
基于的开放花机制

4
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:38,040
I'm going to show you how to make an
在1930年代的设计中，他们首先

5
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:40,670
I'm going to show you how to make an
opening flower mechanism that is based
出现在《每日快报》儿童

6
00:00:40,670 --> 00:00:40,680
opening flower mechanism that is based
年度排名第三的是

7
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:44,390
opening flower mechanism that is based
on a design from the 1930s they first
叫花仙子，他有一些

8
00:00:44,390 --> 00:00:44,400
on a design from the 1930s they first
底下相当复杂的折叠

9
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:47,030
on a design from the 1930s they first
appeared in the Daily Express children's
把花朵从页面上抬起来

10
00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:47,040
appeared in the Daily Express children's
我不知道他为什么这么做

11
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:50,780
appeared in the Daily Express children's
annual number three here it is it's
我认为可能是因为

12
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:50,790
annual number three here it is it's
使用的卡非常薄且脆弱

13
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:54,590
annual number three here it is it's
called the flower fairy he's got some
弯曲的，所以他想把它翻倍

14
00:00:54,590 --> 00:00:54,600
called the flower fairy he's got some
给它力量来解除

15
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:57,470
called the flower fairy he's got some
quite complicated folding underneath
花了，我要去的版本

16
00:00:57,470 --> 00:00:57,480
quite complicated folding underneath
告诉你更简单一点

17
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:59,540
quite complicated folding underneath
that raises the flower up off the page
他们会表达孩子们的年度

18
00:00:59,540 --> 00:00:59,550
that raises the flower up off the page
第三，然后相同的设计

19
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:02,600
that raises the flower up off the page
and I can't quite work out why he did
或多或少在稍后重复

20
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:02,610
and I can't quite work out why he did
我相信这本书不是30多岁

21
00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:04,520
and I can't quite work out why he did
that I think it might be because the
故事十，这是设计

22
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:04,530
that I think it might be because the
那个时候，你可以看到那朵花是

23
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:06,980
that I think it might be because the
card is used is very thin and flimsy and
较小，它在页面上较低

24
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:06,990
card is used is very thin and flimsy and
相同的基本机制不同

25
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:09,080
card is used is very thin and flimsy and
bendy and so he wanted some of it double
艺术品，但基本机制相同

26
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:09,090
bendy and so he wanted some of it double
现在，我将向您展示如何做到这一点

27
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:10,790
bendy and so he wanted some of it double
to give it the strength to lift the
从一朵花开始，然后切一个粗糙的

28
00:01:10,790 --> 00:01:10,800
to give it the strength to lift the
广场，所以我只是偷工减料

29
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:12,680
to give it the strength to lift the
flower up and the version I'm going to
告诉你如何制作花

30
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:12,690
flower up and the version I'm going to
然后我会告诉你

31
00:01:12,690 --> 00:01:14,870
flower up and the version I'm going to
show you is a little more simple so this
提出来，所以这就是我们

32
00:01:14,870 --> 00:01:14,880
show you is a little more simple so this
会瞄准这是花

33
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:17,090
show you is a little more simple so this
is they'll express children's annual
在非常基本的V形折叠上提出，这是

34
00:01:17,090 --> 00:01:17,100
is they'll express children's annual
没有增加的直角v形折叠

35
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:20,660
is they'll express children's annual
number three and then the same design
在顶部创建一个沟壑，你

36
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:20,670
number three and then the same design
把面粉塞进你试过的

37
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:23,240
number three and then the same design
more or less was repeated later in the
遵循早期的设计

38
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:23,250
more or less was repeated later in the
这些孔被切开，给它更多

39
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:25,820
more or less was repeated later in the
30s I believe in this book are no
精致但具有我所设计的

40
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:25,830
30s I believe in this book are no
使它看起来不太正确，所以我

41
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:28,880
30s I believe in this book are no
stories number ten and here's the design
可能会略有不同

42
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:28,890
stories number ten and here's the design
时间，但让我们为您

43
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:31,760
stories number ten and here's the design
that time and you can see the flower is
试一试，知道什么

44
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:31,770
that time and you can see the flower is
你想真正做到，所以这是

45
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:34,310
that time and you can see the flower is
smaller it's lower on the page it's the
基本面粉将其对折，然后我们

46
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:34,320
smaller it's lower on the page it's the
需要这两个对角线，所以我就

47
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:36,950
smaller it's lower on the page it's the
same basic mechanism the different
用三角尺测量那些

48
00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:36,960
same basic mechanism the different
将对齐中央的折痕

49
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:39,590
same basic mechanism the different
artwork but the same basic mechanism so
中央折痕处的投影机

50
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:39,600
artwork but the same basic mechanism so
那那个弹出窗口我现在要

51
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,420
artwork but the same basic mechanism so
now I'll show you how to make that I'll
得分都在45度

52
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:41,430
now I'll show you how to make that I'll
在这方面，我要去

53
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:47,000
now I'll show you how to make that I'll
start with a flower and just cut a rough
将它们延伸到整个花上

54
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:47,010
start with a flower and just cut a rough
而这一点，这将给我们

55
00:01:47,010 --> 00:01:53,480
start with a flower and just cut a rough
square so I'll just just cut the corners
这两个位的基本花形

56
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:53,490
square so I'll just just cut the corners
挺身而出这两位

57
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:55,399
square so I'll just just cut the corners
off and show you how to make the flower
我们到了，然后按一下

58
00:01:55,399 --> 00:01:55,409
off and show you how to make the flower
只是为了确保它正常工作

59
00:01:55,409 --> 00:01:58,130
off and show you how to make the flower
then I'll show you the mechanism that
那就是基本花

60
00:01:58,130 --> 00:01:58,140
then I'll show you the mechanism that
所以我有一个基础表，然后我

61
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:00,830
then I'll show you the mechanism that
that raises it up so this is what we
想要一些绿色的

62
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:00,840
that raises it up so this is what we
代表花朵所以有一些

63
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:03,289
that raises it up so this is what we
will be aiming for this is the flower
绿色在这里，我将基地

64
00:02:03,289 --> 00:02:03,299
will be aiming for this is the flower
现在我们需要基地之一

65
00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:06,920
will be aiming for this is the flower
raised up on a very basic v-fold this is
种，因为他要坚持下去

66
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:06,930
raised up on a very basic v-fold this is
这样它会向前折叠，

67
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:09,919
raised up on a very basic v-fold this is
a right-angle v-fold without increases
花贴在上面，所以我们就

68
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:09,929
a right-angle v-fold without increases
像这样拿一张小卡片

69
00:02:09,929 --> 00:02:12,710
a right-angle v-fold without increases
on the top that creates a gully that you
将它折成两半折得很好

70
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:12,720
on the top that creates a gully that you
这是一个直角V折，所以我们

71
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:15,050
on the top that creates a gully that you
stick the flour into you I tried
会在底部造成折痕

72
00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:15,060
stick the flour into you I tried
全部垂直成一厘米

73
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:17,900
stick the flour into you I tried
following the earlier design which has
再折一次，真的很好

74
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:17,910
following the earlier design which has
切掉的角落也要折叠

75
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:21,950
following the earlier design which has
these holes cut in it that give it more
分开，所以我真的可以

76
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:21,960
these holes cut in it that give it more
加强那些

77
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:25,250
these holes cut in it that give it more
delicacy but with the design that I've
所以这些要贴在页面上

78
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:25,260
delicacy but with the design that I've
这样，现在我们想要额外的

79
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:28,010
delicacy but with the design that I've
made it doesn't look quite right so I
折痕增加了沟壑，所以我会做

80
00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:28,020
made it doesn't look quite right so I
这样的东西，大胆的

81
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:29,630
made it doesn't look quite right so I
might do it slightly differently this
好，这是一个计数器

82
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:29,640
might do it slightly differently this
折叠，所以我们将其推到现在

83
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:32,510
might do it slightly differently this
time but let's just scope for you to
当这卡住了，这将是

84
00:02:32,510 --> 00:02:32,520
time but let's just scope for you to
像那样

85
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:34,910
time but let's just scope for you to
play with it and work out you know what
这种机制的另一条路径

86
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:34,920
play with it and work out you know what
设计而不是机制是

87
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:37,490
play with it and work out you know what
you'd like to make really so this is the
后面的这点给你

88
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:37,500
you'd like to make really so this is the
多余的叶子粘在上面

89
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:46,490
you'd like to make really so this is the
basic flour fold it in half and then we
花，这是钝角v形，所以

90
00:02:46,490 --> 00:02:46,500
basic flour fold it in half and then we
当它折叠下来，这折叠下来

91
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:49,520
basic flour fold it in half and then we
need these two diagonals so I'll just
这样，当我们坚持

92
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:49,530
need these two diagonals so I'll just
这到页面上这将

93
00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:56,570
need these two diagonals so I'll just
use the set square to measure those that
像花一样粘在页面上

94
00:02:56,570 --> 00:02:56,580
use the set square to measure those that
那，这将以这种方式折叠

95
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:59,620
use the set square to measure those that
would line up the central crease on the
但同时我们将拥有

96
00:02:59,620 --> 00:02:59,630
would line up the central crease on the
他们后面的这两片叶子

97
00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:01,820
would line up the central crease on the
projector with the central crease on
用另一种方式折叠下来，所以我们需要

98
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:01,830
projector with the central crease on
将其定位在中间

99
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:06,080
projector with the central crease on
that and that pop-up now I'm going to
在那里，现在我们可以放花了

100
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:06,090
that and that pop-up now I'm going to
会陷入那个沟壑

101
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:09,850
that and that pop-up now I'm going to
score these they're both at 45 degrees
所以当我测试这个并尝试把

102
00:03:09,850 --> 00:03:09,860
score these they're both at 45 degrees
花开，你可以看到它的发展

103
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:16,910
score these they're both at 45 degrees
and on this side as well and I'm going
对基地来说太大了，所以我要

104
00:03:16,910 --> 00:03:16,920
and on this side as well and I'm going
把它拉下来，因为它没有被卡住

105
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:23,830
and on this side as well and I'm going
to extend them right across the flower
真的很坚定，我要做

106


它比较短，所以我在那里剪了一块

107
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:32,630
and this one so this will give us the
并添加折痕并切掉该角

108
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:32,640
and this one so this will give us the
然后把那些折起来

109
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:38,030
and this one so this will give us the
basic flower shape these two bits will
这样会进入

110
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:38,040
basic flower shape these two bits will
它仍然不能正常工作，我必须

111
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:40,040
basic flower shape these two bits will
come forward and these two bits go back
让花变小现在我们坚持

112
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:40,050
come forward and these two bits go back
花在那，但在我们坚持之前

113
00:03:40,050 --> 00:03:42,170
come forward and these two bits go back
there we are and then I'll just press it
进入那个沟渠，让我们检查一下

114
00:03:42,170 --> 00:03:42,180
there we are and then I'll just press it
它会坐在页面上我还不错

115
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:44,750
there we are and then I'll just press it
down just to make sure it's working and
可能会减少更多

116
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:44,760
down just to make sure it's working and
所以我要花一点

117
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:48,050
down just to make sure it's working and
then that's the basic flower
较小的我也可以做一点

118
00:03:48,050 --> 00:03:48,060
then that's the basic flower
切割出更精致的裁片

119
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:50,600
then that's the basic flower
so I've got a base sheet and then I'm
这些角落只是为了给它一点

120
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:50,610
so I've got a base sheet and then I'm
更多的花瓣缺陷，所以我现在就坚持

121
00:03:50,610 --> 00:03:53,930
so I've got a base sheet and then I'm
going to want some green to make the the
进入我在那里创造的沟壑

122
00:03:53,930 --> 00:03:53,940
going to want some green to make the the
完全实现了开放性

123
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:58,100
going to want some green to make the the
stand for the flowers so did have some
Jareau的花型设计引人注目

124
00:03:58,100 --> 00:03:58,110
stand for the flowers so did have some
花掉了，我对这些不满意

125
00:03:58,110 --> 00:04:06,320
stand for the flowers so did have some
green here I'll make the base there's
他们只是保持的角度

126
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:06,330
green here I'll make the base there's
花比我想要的要近

127
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:09,050
green here I'll make the base there's
the base now we need one of these
看看这朵花

128
00:04:09,050 --> 00:04:09,060
the base now we need one of these
打开，如果你看这个花是

129
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:11,210
the base now we need one of these
species because he's going to stick on
更开放我要起飞

130
00:04:11,210 --> 00:04:11,220
species because he's going to stick on
这个绿色的部分，我要用

131
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:14,300
species because he's going to stick on
like this it'll fold forward and the
我正在尝试的这件作品

132
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:14,310
like this it'll fold forward and the
昨天，如果您比较两个角度

133
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:16,670
like this it'll fold forward and the
flowers stick on the top so we'll just
折痕在这块上的角度和

134
00:04:16,670 --> 00:04:16,680
flowers stick on the top so we'll just
比折角好得多

135
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:27,100
flowers stick on the top so we'll just
take a small piece of card like this
在这件作品上，我想也许这件作品

136


仍然有点高考虑

137
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:34,510
fold it in half crease it really well
你将不得不钝

138


角度V落在它后面，所以我要

139
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:37,280
this is a right angle V fold so we're
使这块小一点我

140
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:37,290
this is a right angle V fold so we're
要去那里一块

141
00:04:37,290 --> 00:04:39,260
this is a right angle V fold so we're
going to make a crease along the bottom
复述那些将是这样的

142
