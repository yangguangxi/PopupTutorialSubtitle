本教程是关于移动手臂的

2
00:00:36,299 --> 00:00:36,309
this tutorial is about moving arms which
这是一个非常微妙的机制

3
00:00:36,309 --> 00:00:38,700
this tutorial is about moving arms which
is a very subtle mechanism which has
最多的变化和使用最多

basic is based on the parallelogram
黄色的位是基本的动臂

8
00:00:44,009 --> 00:00:44,019
basic is based on the parallelogram
粉红色的位在手臂上加了一个肘

9
00:00:44,019 --> 00:00:47,700
basic is based on the parallelogram
which we cover in tutorial 5 here it is
这使得运动看起来更加如此

10
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:47,710
which we cover in tutorial 5 here it is
这是基本的变化

11
00:00:47,710 --> 00:00:50,279
which we cover in tutorial 5 here it is
the green bit is the parallelogram the
这个例子是基本的平行四边形

12
00:00:50,279 --> 00:00:50,289
the green bit is the parallelogram the
您可以看到四个动臂

13
00:00:50,289 --> 00:00:52,649
the green bit is the parallelogram the
yellow bit is a basic moving arm the
四肢或略微向内移动

14
00:00:52,649 --> 00:00:52,659
yellow bit is a basic moving arm the
不同的方向，如果我们看

15
00:00:52,659 --> 00:00:55,229
yellow bit is a basic moving arm the
pink bit is adding an elbow to the arm
兰普和科夫斯基的鬼屋

16
00:00:55,229 --> 00:00:55,239
pink bit is adding an elbow to the arm
这有一个很好的例子，所以

17
00:00:55,239 --> 00:00:58,739
pink bit is adding an elbow to the arm
which makes appear to move even more so
这是平行四边形这是两个

18
00:00:58,739 --> 00:00:58,749
which makes appear to move even more so
移动手臂，使其中一个移动

19
00:00:58,749 --> 00:01:02,250
which makes appear to move even more so
this is the basic variation here's an
在页面上，您会看到相同的内容

20
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:02,260
this is the basic variation here's an
卡的一面一直

21
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:06,149
this is the basic variation here's an
example this is the basic parallelogram
通过另一片翻转

22
00:01:06,149 --> 00:01:06,159
example this is the basic parallelogram
平行四边形有两个小

23
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:09,209
example this is the basic parallelogram
you can see that with four moving arms
三角形，这取决于哪个三角形

24
00:01:09,209 --> 00:01:09,219
you can see that with four moving arms
你坚持下去如果你坚持下去

25
00:01:09,219 --> 00:01:12,209
you can see that with four moving arms
on it four limbs or moving in slightly
一个在另一边

26
00:01:12,209 --> 00:01:12,219
on it four limbs or moving in slightly
平行四边形就是

27
00:01:12,219 --> 00:01:15,620
on it four limbs or moving in slightly
different directions if we look at the
相对页面旋转，因此

28
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:15,630
different directions if we look at the
真的最有用的其他小

29
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:20,209
different directions if we look at the
the haunted house by Lampe and Kowski
三角形就是那个

30
00:01:20,209 --> 00:01:20,219
the haunted house by Lampe and Kowski
那辆车翻过来

31
00:01:20,219 --> 00:01:24,149
the haunted house by Lampe and Kowski
this has got a really good example so
平行四边形也在此处形成沟壑

32
00:01:24,149 --> 00:01:24,159
this has got a really good example so
它连接页面的位置，因此您可以粘贴

33
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:27,149
this has got a really good example so
here's the parallelogram here are two
为此而动臂

34
00:01:27,149 --> 00:01:27,159
here's the parallelogram here are two
这是一个例子，这是基本的

35
00:01:27,159 --> 00:01:30,959
here's the parallelogram here are two
moving arms so one of them moves rotates
平行四边形这是动臂

36
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:30,969
moving arms so one of them moves rotates
我们已经看了另外两个

37
00:01:30,969 --> 00:01:33,359
moving arms so one of them moves rotates
against the page and you see the same
小三角形卡在这个沟中

38
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:33,369
against the page and you see the same
由平行四边形加入

39
00:01:33,369 --> 00:01:35,010
against the page and you see the same
side of the piece of card all the way
页面，所以这两个有两个移动

40
00:01:35,010 --> 00:01:35,020
side of the piece of card all the way
手臂被卡住，如您所见

41
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:37,590
side of the piece of card all the way
through the other piece flips over on
打开和关闭它有一个不同的

42
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:37,600
through the other piece flips over on
动作，这是另一个例子

43
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:40,050
through the other piece flips over on
the parallelogram there are two small
这是使用这种类型的机制吗

44
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:40,060
the parallelogram there are two small
所以平行折叠到

45
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:41,669
the parallelogram there are two small
triangles and it depends which triangle
页面，我们被卡住了小三角形

46
00:01:41,669 --> 00:01:41,679
triangles and it depends which triangle
在，所以这些都让我们感动

47
00:01:41,679 --> 00:01:43,440
triangles and it depends which triangle
you stick it to if you stick it to this
手臂朝着不同的方向运动

48
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:43,450
you stick it to if you stick it to this
有很多方法可以做到这一点

49
00:01:43,450 --> 00:01:45,179
you stick it to if you stick it to this
one which is on the small side of the
用过，所以这是一个非常复杂的

50
00:01:45,179 --> 00:01:45,189
one which is on the small side of the
所以这是基本的跳跃

51
00:01:45,189 --> 00:01:47,099
one which is on the small side of the
parallelogram that is the one that
我刚刚告诉你的数字

52
00:01:47,099 --> 00:01:47,109
parallelogram that is the one that
其中两个有两个平行四边形

53
00:01:47,109 --> 00:01:49,169
parallelogram that is the one that
rotates against the page so that's
与这些跳跃彼此建立

54
00:01:49,169 --> 00:01:49,179
rotates against the page so that's
算出其他变化，这是

55
00:01:49,179 --> 00:01:51,719
rotates against the page so that's
really the most useful the other small
类型，所以这实际上是移动

56
00:01:51,719 --> 00:01:51,729
really the most useful the other small
手臂从面具后面出现，所以

57
00:01:51,729 --> 00:01:53,190
really the most useful the other small
triangle that's the one that will make
绿色位是一个大的平行四边形，

58
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:53,200
triangle that's the one that will make
手臂实际上粘在页面上

59
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:56,340
triangle that's the one that will make
the the piece of car flip over the
角度使它运动

60
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:56,350
the the piece of car flip over the
当它打开和关闭时，这是

61
00:01:56,350 --> 00:01:58,800
the the piece of car flip over the
parallelogram also creates a gully here
如果你看看它的另一种变化

62
00:01:58,800 --> 00:01:58,810
parallelogram also creates a gully here
这样一来，您会看到那些

63
00:01:58,810 --> 00:02:01,800
parallelogram also creates a gully here
where it joins the page so you can stick
绿色里面有一个平行四边形

64
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:01,810
where it joins the page so you can stick
一个只是一个面具，然后有一个

65
00:02:01,810 --> 00:02:07,469
where it joins the page so you can stick
moving arms in for that
平行四边形与移动

66


手臂粘在上面，而不是看到

67
00:02:07,479 --> 00:02:11,740
here's an example here's the basic
整个机制及其运作方式

68
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:11,750
here's an example here's the basic
只是看到图像从后面出现

69
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:14,680
here's an example here's the basic
parallelogram this is the moving arm
绿色面具后面

70
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:14,690
parallelogram this is the moving arm
所以我只做其中之一

71
00:02:14,690 --> 00:02:16,990
parallelogram this is the moving arm
we've already looked at here's two more
你可以看到如何制作它，你需要一个

72
00:02:16,990 --> 00:02:17,000
we've already looked at here's two more
卡片的底页将其对折

73
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,330
we've already looked at here's two more
small triangles stuck into this gully
彻底弄皱，需要一块

74
00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:19,340
small triangles stuck into this gully
使平行四边形与

75
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:21,670
small triangles stuck into this gully
created by the parallelogram joining the
一张像这样折的卡

76
00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:21,680
created by the parallelogram joining the
两端各有一个折痕

77
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:24,369
created by the parallelogram joining the
page and so these two have two moving
好吧，我们在这里制作平行四边形

78
00:02:24,369 --> 00:02:24,379
page and so these two have two moving
如教程5中所述，所以您只需

79
00:02:24,379 --> 00:02:26,320
page and so these two have two moving
arms stuck on and so as you see as you
折叠一个额外的平行折痕，这样

80
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:26,330
arms stuck on and so as you see as you
现在你得到的是

81
00:02:26,330 --> 00:02:28,780
arms stuck on and so as you see as you
open and close it they have a different
三个平行的折痕

82
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:28,790
open and close it they have a different
一面和短面，以便找出

83
00:02:28,790 --> 00:02:33,039
open and close it they have a different
action and here's another example this
你把这个贴在哪里

84
00:02:33,039 --> 00:02:33,049
action and here's another example this
您只需要在页面上标记一个

85
00:02:33,049 --> 00:02:36,160
action and here's another example this
is this is using that type of mechanism
的褶皱所在，所以我只标记

86
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:36,170
is this is using that type of mechanism
短边的能力，然后

87
00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:38,979
is this is using that type of mechanism
so is the parallel fold through to the
你要把它翻转过来

88
00:02:38,979 --> 00:02:38,989
so is the parallel fold through to the
遮住并留长边

89
00:02:38,989 --> 00:02:41,350
so is the parallel fold through to the
page and we've got small triangles stuck
这将为您提供基本的

90
00:02:41,350 --> 00:02:41,360
page and we've got small triangles stuck
平行四边形，但在我们这样做之前

91
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:44,170
page and we've got small triangles stuck
in and so those are giving us moving
您还有另外一组折痕

92
00:02:44,170 --> 00:02:44,180
in and so those are giving us moving
做两个小三角形，这是

93
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:48,150
in and so those are giving us moving
arms are moving in different directions
您的卡这​​就是您的折痕

94


顶部边缘向下，所以它是齐平的

95
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:51,819
there are numerous ways that this can be
有那个折痕所以很红

96
00:02:51,819 --> 00:02:51,829
there are numerous ways that this can be
折痕在那里然后折回去

97
00:02:51,829 --> 00:02:54,250
there are numerous ways that this can be
used so here's a really complicated one
本身，是的，只是将其推入

98
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:54,260
used so here's a really complicated one
确保一切正常

99
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:57,250
used so here's a really complicated one
so this is this is the basic jumping
再折回去，所以现在

100
00:02:57,250 --> 00:02:57,260
so this is this is the basic jumping
确保两个小

101
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:58,660
so this is this is the basic jumping
figure that I just showed you got those
三角形在顶部被卡住了

102
00:02:58,660 --> 00:02:58,670
figure that I just showed you got those
在页面底部附近粘贴

103
00:02:58,670 --> 00:03:00,220
figure that I just showed you got those
two of them there's two parallelograms
您为标记所做的长边

104
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:00,230
two of them there's two parallelograms
较短的一面，以便页面平整时

105
00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:03,520
two of them there's two parallelograms
built onto each other with these jumping
平行四边形平放，所以您可以

106
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:03,530
built onto each other with these jumping
同时粘贴两个标签

107
00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:09,759
built onto each other with these jumping
figures other variations there's this
有胶水

108
00:03:09,759 --> 00:03:09,769
figures other variations there's this
对，所以用折痕压住它

109
00:03:09,769 --> 00:03:13,090
figures other variations there's this
type so this is actually the the moving
做到这一点，以便

110
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:13,100
type so this is actually the the moving
整个东西都是平整的

111
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:16,750
type so this is actually the the moving
arm appears from behind a mask so the
应与脊柱折叠平行

112
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:16,760
arm appears from behind a mask so the
它关闭确保前进

113
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:19,629
arm appears from behind a mask so the
green bit is a big parallelogram and the
确保现在一切正常

114
00:03:19,629 --> 00:03:19,639
green bit is a big parallelogram and the
您可以将它们弹出来，这就是

115
00:03:19,639 --> 00:03:21,970
green bit is a big parallelogram and the
arm is actually stuck to the page at an
基本的潜在机制

116
00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:21,980
arm is actually stuck to the page at an
平行四边形有两个小小的

117
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:24,339
arm is actually stuck to the page at an
angle that's what gives it the movement
添加三角形，然后您将

118
00:03:24,339 --> 00:03:24,349
angle that's what gives it the movement
移动手臂，这样就适合

119
00:03:24,349 --> 00:03:27,309
angle that's what gives it the movement
as it opens and closes and here's
短边，所以很适合

120
00:03:27,309 --> 00:03:27,319
as it opens and closes and here's
在那个三角形上，你可以修剪

121
00:03:27,319 --> 00:03:30,490
as it opens and closes and here's
another variation of it if you look at
那里放了一点胶水

122
00:03:30,490 --> 00:03:30,500
another variation of it if you look at
正确地粘在那里

123
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:32,080
another variation of it if you look at
it this way around you'll see those
我到这儿来的东西太久了

124
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:32,090
it this way around you'll see those
关闭将紧缩

125
00:03:32,090 --> 00:03:35,289
it this way around you'll see those
there's a parallelogram inside the green
脊椎，所以我只剪一块

126
00:03:35,289 --> 00:03:35,299
there's a parallelogram inside the green
如果合适的话，现在很合适

127
00:03:35,299 --> 00:03:37,509
there's a parallelogram inside the green
one is just a mask and then there's a
如果需要的话，可以在参数中很好地

128
00:03:37,509 --> 00:03:37,519
one is just a mask and then there's a
让它给你额外的肘部

129
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:40,089
one is just a mask and then there's a
parallelogram inside with the moving
可以从车上切下来

130
00:03:40,089 --> 00:03:40,099
parallelogram inside with the moving
粘上

131
00:03:40,099 --> 00:03:42,069
parallelogram inside with the moving
arms stuck to it rather than seeing the
所以这里有基本的动臂

132
00:03:42,069 --> 00:03:42,079
arms stuck to it rather than seeing the
这就是它的工作原理

133
00:03:42,079 --> 00:03:43,930
arms stuck to it rather than seeing the
whole mechanism and how it works you
所以现在我将向您展示整个系列

134
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:43,940
whole mechanism and how it works you
书中其他例子的例子

135
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:45,970
whole mechanism and how it works you
just see the image appearing from behind
所有的变化都非常有用

136
00:03:45,970 --> 00:03:45,980
just see the image appearing from behind
机制，所以首先我们要知道的是

137
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:51,830
just see the image appearing from behind
behind the green mask

óbuda，所以在这里，我们有一个

139
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,119
so I'll just make one of those just so
动臂这是一个小的V型折

140
00:03:54,119 --> 00:03:54,129
so I'll just make one of those just so
尾巴移动

141
00:03:54,129 --> 00:03:56,399
so I'll just make one of those just so
you can see how to make it you'll need a
这样身体就成为一个

142
00:03:56,399 --> 00:03:56,409
you can see how to make it you'll need a
平行四边形运动臂

143
00:03:56,409 --> 00:03:59,599
you can see how to make it you'll need a
base sheet sheet of card fold it in half
面具下面的头在

144
00:03:59,599 --> 00:03:59,609
