okay but it tends to make the card
buckle and it goes off more slowly so

38
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:29,390
buckle and it goes off more slowly so

39
00:01:29,390 --> 00:01:31,990

117
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:21,500
card by eyes fold it in half folds are
really important in pop-ups so the more

118
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:21,510
really important in pop-ups so the more

119
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:23,660
really important in pop-ups so the more
you the more you fold it the most sweet

120
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:23,670
you the more you fold it the most sweet

121
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:26,270

little moves its I always think of folds

122
00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:26,280
little moves its I always think of folds

123
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:30,740

as like they're like hinges and creasing

124
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:30,750
as like they're like hinges and creasing

125
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:32,330
as like they're like hinges and creasing
the fold thoroughly is like greasing the

126
00:03:32,330 --> 00:03:32,340
the fold thoroughly is like greasing the

127
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:36,170
the fold thoroughly is like greasing the
hinge so you take this piece of cards we

128
00:03:36,170 --> 00:03:36,180
hinge so you take this piece of cards we

129
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:40,880
hinge so you take this piece of cards we
cut into it just one cut from the folded

130
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:40,890
cut into it just one cut from the folded

131
00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:43,670
cut into it just one cut from the folded
edge and then just bend that over so

132
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:43,680
edge and then just bend that over so

133
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:47,330
edge and then just bend that over so
we're bending that over like this so it

134
00:03:47,330 --> 00:03:47,340
we're bending that over like this so it

135
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:52,420
we're bending that over like this so it
looks like that fold it back on itself

136

either all the creases meet at the same

182
00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:05,540
either all the creases meet at the same

183
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:08,280
either all the creases meet at the same
points they're converging creases

184
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:08,290
points they're converging creases

185
00:05:08,290 --> 00:05:10,660
points they're converging creases
meeting at the same point on the spine

186
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:10,670
meeting at the same point on the spine

187
00:05:10,670 --> 00:05:13,570
meeting at the same point on the spine
the other type of parallel creases so

188
00:05:13,570 --> 00:05:13,580
the other type of parallel creases so

189
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:15,970
the other type of parallel creases so
all the creases are parallel to the

190
00:05:15,970 --> 00:05:15,980
all the creases are parallel to the

191
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:17,890
all the creases are parallel to the
spine and these are the two underlying

192
00:05:17,890 --> 00:05:17,900
spine and these are the two underlying

193
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:21,820
spine and these are the two underlying
principles in all pop ups so this type

194
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:21,830
principles in all pop ups so this type

195
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:23,770
principles in all pop ups so this type
of proper mechanism is called counter

196
00:05:23,770 --> 00:05:23,780
of proper mechanism is called counter

197
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:26,590
of proper mechanism is called counter
folds and here's an example that I did

198
00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:26,600
folds and here's an example that I did

199
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:29,110
folds and here's an example that I did
with some school kids and so this is

200
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:29,120
with some school kids and so this is

201
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:32,920
with some school kids and so this is
counter folds it's it's this type with

202
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:32,930
counter folds it's it's this type with

203
00:05:32,930 --> 00:05:36,070
counter folds it's it's this type with
converging creases and it's made made

204
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:36,080
converging creases and it's made made

205
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:38,560
converging creases and it's made made
into a face and it's just glued on to a

206
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:38,570
into a face and it's just glued on to a

207
00:05:38,570 --> 00:05:41,500
into a face and it's just glued on to a
background so this is really basic

208
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:41,510
background so this is really basic

209
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:44,710
background so this is really basic
simple stuff there is a book with some

210
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:44,720
simple stuff there is a book with some

211
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:49,140
simple stuff there is a book with some

champion Kowski look at the first spread

214
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:52,790
champion Kowski look at the first spread

215
00:05:52,790 --> 00:05:57,220
champion Kowski look at the first spread
and it's one of these v-folds converging

216
00:05:57,220 --> 00:05:57,230
and it's one of these v-folds converging

217
00:05:57,230 --> 00:06:01,960
and it's one of these v-folds converging
crease converging creases pop-ups we can

218
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:01,970
crease converging creases pop-ups we can

219
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:03,670
crease converging creases pop-ups we can
also look at the last spread in this

220
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:03,680
also look at the last spread in this

221
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:08,020
also look at the last spread in this
book and here it is this bottom jaw of

222
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:08,030
book and here it is this bottom jaw of

223
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:10,240
book and here it is this bottom jaw of
this shark is converging creases this is

224
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:10,250
this shark is converging creases this is

225
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:12,340
this shark is converging creases this is
the V fold and the top drawer of the

226
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:12,350
the V fold and the top drawer of the

227
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:15,700
the V fold and the top drawer of the
shark is a parallel fold you can always

228
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:15,710
shark is a parallel fold you can always

229
00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:17,590
shark is a parallel fold you can always
tell parallel folds if you look at the

230
00:06:17,590 --> 00:06:17,600
tell parallel folds if you look at the

231
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:20,770
tell parallel folds if you look at the
book end on you can look down the spine

232
00:06:20,770 --> 00:06:20,780
book end on you can look down the spine

233
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:23,050
book end on you can look down the spine
and you can see that although all the

234
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:23,060
and you can see that although all the

235
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:27,550
and you can see that although all the
creases are parallel this type of

236
00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:27,560
creases are parallel this type of

237
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:30,610
creases are parallel this type of
mechanism can be applied to any folds in

238
00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:30,620
mechanism can be applied to any folds in

239
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:33,220
mechanism can be applied to any folds in
any pop-up and so you can use this type

240
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:33,230
any pop-up and so you can use this type

241
00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:35,950
any pop-up and so you can use this type
of mechanism as actual part of the

242
00:06:35,950 --> 00:06:35,960
of mechanism as actual part of the

243
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:37,240
of mechanism as actual part of the
sculpting of the

244
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:37,250
sculpting of the

245
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:39,610
sculpting of the
the sculpture or it can be used as just

246
00:06:39,610 --> 00:06:39,620
the sculpture or it can be used as just

247
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:41,890
the sculpture or it can be used as just
the muscle to raise a larger piece of

248
00:06:41,890 --> 00:06:41,900
the muscle to raise a larger piece of

249
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:44,890
the muscle to raise a larger piece of
card so if we look at this book and this

250
00:06:44,890 --> 00:06:44,900
card so if we look at this book and this

251
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:48,400
card so if we look at this book and this
is jungle days by Helen bomber and this

252
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:48,410
is jungle days by Helen bomber and this

253
00:06:48,410 --> 00:06:52,150
is jungle days by Helen bomber and this
is an example of a counter fold being

254
00:06:52,150 --> 00:06:52,160
is an example of a counter fold being

255
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:55,150
is an example of a counter fold being
used to scalp the actual pop-up so this

256
00:06:55,150 --> 00:06:55,160
used to scalp the actual pop-up so this

257
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:59,230
used to scalp the actual pop-up so this
here this is the counter fold as the

258
00:06:59,230 --> 00:06:59,240
here this is the counter fold as the

259
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:02,620
here this is the counter fold as the
book closes as it opens you can see how

260
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:02,630
book closes as it opens you can see how

261
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:04,180
book closes as it opens you can see how
it moves and yet this is all made from

262
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:04,190
it moves and yet this is all made from

263
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:06,100
it moves and yet this is all made from
one flat piece of card you can actually

264
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:06,110
one flat piece of card you can actually

265
00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:08,680
one flat piece of card you can actually
close the book and just open and close

266
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:08,690
close the book and just open and close

267
00:07:08,690 --> 00:07:10,840
close the book and just open and close
it like that so this is the counter fold

268
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:10,850
it like that so this is the counter fold

269
00:07:10,850 --> 00:07:13,450
it like that so this is the counter fold
being used as part of the sculpture of

270
00:07:13,450 --> 00:07:13,460
being used as part of the sculpture of

271
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:20,800
being used as part of the sculpture of
the design this book this is robot by

champion Kowski in this pop-up spread

275
00:07:24,970 --> 00:07:28,300
champion Kowski in this pop-up spread
these counter folds he's used these type

276
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:28,310
these counter folds he's used these type

277
00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:31,090
these counter folds he's used these type
of converging crease counter folds these

278
00:07:31,090 --> 00:07:31,100
of converging crease counter folds these

279
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:33,930
of converging crease counter folds these
are the muscles to move larger pieces so

280
00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:33,940
are the muscles to move larger pieces so

281
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:39,220
are the muscles to move larger pieces so
this is a parallel fold and then here on

282
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:39,230
this is a parallel fold and then here on

283
00:07:39,230 --> 00:07:41,080
this is a parallel fold and then here on
each side you've got these small counter

284
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:41,090
each side you've got these small counter

285
00:07:41,090 --> 00:07:44,890
each side you've got these small counter
folds that are used to as the muscle to

00:07:44,890 --> 00:07:44,900
folds that are used to as the muscle to

287
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:47,290
folds that are used to as the muscle to
lift these two little robots and so as

288
00:07:47,290 --> 00:07:47,300
lift these two little robots and so as

289
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:50,080
lift these two little robots and so as
the page opens and closes you can see

290
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:50,090
the page opens and closes you can see

291
00:07:50,090 --> 00:07:52,270
the page opens and closes you can see
the counter folds that muscles are

292
00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:52,280
the counter folds that muscles are

293
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:56,620
the counter folds that muscles are
moving those two two small robots but

294
00:07:56,620 --> 00:07:56,630
moving those two two small robots but

295
00:07:56,630 --> 00:07:59,020
moving those two two small robots but
this type of pop-up these elementary

296
00:07:59,020 --> 00:07:59,030
this type of pop-up these elementary

297
00:07:59,030 --> 00:08:01,540
this type of pop-up these elementary
pop-ups when the page is flat the pop-up

pop-ups when the page is flat the pop-up

299
00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:03,460
pop-ups when the page is flat the pop-up
is flat and they're not actually true

300
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:03,470
is flat and they're not actually true

301
00:08:03,470 --> 00:08:05,200
is flat and they're not actually true
pop-ups they're more like something you

00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:05,210
pop-ups they're more like something you

303
00:08:05,210 --> 00:08:07,659
pop-ups they're more like something you
can add to pop-ups so I'm going to show

304
00:08:07,659 --> 00:08:07,669
can add to pop-ups so I'm going to show

305
00:08:07,669 --> 00:08:10,180
can add to pop-ups so I'm going to show
you how to make two pop-ups one

306
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:10,190
you how to make two pop-ups one

307
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:15,900
you how to make two pop-ups one
converging creases one parallel creases

308
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:15,910


309
00:08:15,910 --> 00:08:18,280
there are three principals three

310
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:18,290
there are three principals three

311
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:20,020
there are three principals three
important principles that apply to all

312
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:20,030
important principles that apply to all

313
00:08:20,030 --> 00:08:22,240
important principles that apply to all
pop-ups the first one is that every

314
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:22,250
pop-ups the first one is that every

315
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:25,120
pop-ups the first one is that every
pop-up must span a galley so this is a

316
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:25,130
pop-up must span a galley so this is a

317
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:28,570
pop-up must span a galley so this is a
base sheet we fold it in half do it by

318
00:08:28,570 --> 00:08:28,580
base sheet we fold it in half do it by

319
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:32,649
base sheet we fold it in half do it by
eye crease it really thoroughly fold it

320
00:08:32,649 --> 00:08:32,659
eye crease it really thoroughly fold it

321
00:08:32,659 --> 00:08:37,480
eye crease it really thoroughly fold it
back on itself crease it again this is

322
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:37,490
back on itself crease it again this is

323
00:08:37,490 --> 00:08:41,709
back on itself crease it again this is
your base sheet this is the galley

324
00:08:41,709 --> 00:08:41,719
your base sheet this is the galley

325
00:08:41,719 --> 00:08:43,690
your base sheet this is the galley
it's the galley opening that will power

326
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:43,700
it's the galley opening that will power

327
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:47,260
it's the galley opening that will power
the pop-up I'll take a piece to make the

328
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:47,270
the pop-up I'll take a piece to make the

329
00:08:47,270 --> 00:08:53,319
the pop-up I'll take a piece to make the
pop-ups with

330
00:08:53,319 --> 00:08:53,329


331
00:08:53,329 --> 00:08:55,819
so do it again everything everything is

332
00:08:55,819 --> 00:08:55,829
so do it again everything everything is

333
00:08:55,829 --> 00:08:57,980
so do it again everything everything is
done by eye you just cut the piece of

334
00:08:57,980 --> 00:08:57,990
done by eye you just cut the piece of

335
00:08:57,990 --> 00:09:07,189
done by eye you just cut the piece of
card in half fold it in half crease it

336
00:09:07,189 --> 00:09:07,199
card in half fold it in half crease it

337
00:09:07,199 --> 00:09:10,249
card in half fold it in half crease it
really thoroughly and the second

338
00:09:10,249 --> 00:09:10,259
really thoroughly and the second

339
00:09:10,259 --> 00:09:13,730
really thoroughly and the second
principle is that pop-ups must must

340
00:09:13,730 --> 00:09:13,740
principle is that pop-ups must must

341
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:15,620
principle is that pop-ups must must
balance on each side of the galleys

342
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:15,630
balance on each side of the galleys

343
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:18,199
balance on each side of the galleys
so pop-ups maths Panigale they must

344
00:09:18,199 --> 00:09:18,209
so pop-ups maths Panigale they must

345
00:09:18,209 --> 00:09:19,730
so pop-ups maths Panigale they must
stick down to both sides of the galley

346
00:09:19,730 --> 00:09:19,740
stick down to both sides of the galley

347
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:21,590
stick down to both sides of the galley
and then they must balance on each side

348
00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:21,600
and then they must balance on each side

349
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:24,259
and then they must balance on each side
of the gully so in this case we're

350
00:09:24,259 --> 00:09:24,269
of the gully so in this case we're

351
00:09:24,269 --> 00:09:27,769
of the gully so in this case we're
making a converging crease of V folds so

352
00:09:27,769 --> 00:09:27,779
making a converging crease of V folds so

353
00:09:27,779 --> 00:09:30,050
making a converging crease of V folds so
with v-folds it's the angles that

354
00:09:30,050 --> 00:09:30,060
with v-folds it's the angles that

355
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:33,379
with v-folds it's the angles that
balance so here's the pop-up piece we're

356
00:09:33,379 --> 00:09:33,389
balance so here's the pop-up piece we're

357
00:09:33,389 --> 00:09:36,379
balance so here's the pop-up piece we're
folding the tabs onto the bottom which

358
00:09:36,379 --> 00:09:36,389
folding the tabs onto the bottom which

359
00:09:36,389 --> 00:09:44,329
folding the tabs onto the bottom which
will glue to the page by doing it this

360
00:09:44,329 --> 00:09:44,339
will glue to the page by doing it this

361
00:09:44,339 --> 00:09:46,699
will glue to the page by doing it this
way we've made the two the two angles on

362
00:09:46,699 --> 00:09:46,709
way we've made the two the two angles on

363
00:09:46,709 --> 00:09:48,559
way we've made the two the two angles on
each side of the pop-up at the same in

364
00:09:48,559 --> 00:09:48,569
each side of the pop-up at the same in

365
00:09:48,569 --> 00:09:53,379
each side of the pop-up at the same in
this case they're both ninety degrees

366
00:09:53,379 --> 00:09:53,389


367
00:09:53,389 --> 00:09:58,449
again reinforce those those folds so

368
00:09:58,449 --> 00:09:58,459
again reinforce those those folds so

369
00:09:58,459 --> 00:10:01,939
again reinforce those those folds so
we've got there the angles on the pop-up

370
00:10:01,939 --> 00:10:01,949
we've got there the angles on the pop-up

371
00:10:01,949 --> 00:10:05,030
we've got there the angles on the pop-up
a balancing now we've got to stick it to

372
00:10:05,030 --> 00:10:05,040
a balancing now we've got to stick it to

373
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:08,780
a balancing now we've got to stick it to
the page and the two angles on the base

374
00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:08,790
the page and the two angles on the base

375
00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:12,999
the page and the two angles on the base
we've got to balance so we get the glue

376
00:10:12,999 --> 00:10:13,009
we've got to balance so we get the glue

377
00:10:13,009 --> 00:10:18,230
we've got to balance so we get the glue
my secret with glue is to put the glue

378
00:10:18,230 --> 00:10:18,240
my secret with glue is to put the glue

379
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:21,379
my secret with glue is to put the glue
on on just on one side and then I always

380
00:10:21,379 --> 00:10:21,389
on on just on one side and then I always

381
00:10:21,389 --> 00:10:24,079
on on just on one side and then I always
use my little finger I use my little

382
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:24,089
use my little finger I use my little

383
00:10:24,089 --> 00:10:26,540
use my little finger I use my little
finger so that I can spread the glue

384
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:26,550
finger so that I can spread the glue

385
00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:29,769
finger so that I can spread the glue
really evenly but my fingers remain

386
00:10:29,769 --> 00:10:29,779
really evenly but my fingers remain

387
00:10:29,779 --> 00:10:32,809
really evenly but my fingers remain
dextra so I can handle other things and

388
00:10:32,809 --> 00:10:32,819
dextra so I can handle other things and

389
00:10:32,819 --> 00:10:34,939
dextra so I can handle other things and
without them getting stuck it's really

390
00:10:34,939 --> 00:10:34,949
without them getting stuck it's really

391
00:10:34,949 --> 00:10:36,530
without them getting stuck it's really
important that the glue goes right up to

392
00:10:36,530 --> 00:10:36,540
important that the glue goes right up to

393
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:38,600
important that the glue goes right up to
the crease the crease in pop up is

394
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:38,610
the crease the crease in pop up is

395
00:10:38,610 --> 00:10:40,429
the crease the crease in pop up is
really important the glue goes to the

396
00:10:40,429 --> 00:10:40,439
really important the glue goes to the

397
00:10:40,439 --> 00:10:42,199
really important the glue goes to the
crease all measuring is done to the

398
00:10:42,199 --> 00:10:42,209
crease all measuring is done to the

399
00:10:42,209 --> 00:10:46,129
crease all measuring is done to the
crease so here we go the central crease

400
00:10:46,129 --> 00:10:46,139
crease so here we go the central crease

401
00:10:46,139 --> 00:10:48,470
crease so here we go the central crease
is lined up with the gully and stick

402
00:10:48,470 --> 00:10:48,480
is lined up with the gully and stick

403
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:51,139
is lined up with the gully and stick
that side down now you fold the whole

404
00:10:51,139 --> 00:10:51,149
that side down now you fold the whole

405
00:10:51,149 --> 00:10:56,590
that side down now you fold the whole
piece shut put glue on the other side

406
00:10:56,590 --> 00:10:56,600


407
00:10:56,600 --> 00:11:01,220
again smear the glue up to the crease

408
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:01,230


409
00:11:01,230 --> 00:11:07,610
shut the base press it well and here's

410
00:11:07,610 --> 00:11:07,620
shut the base press it well and here's

411
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:10,340
shut the base press it well and here's
the first pop-up so in this case every

412
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:10,350
the first pop-up so in this case every

413
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:12,200
the first pop-up so in this case every
pop out spans a gully and then the

414
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:12,210
pop out spans a gully and then the

415
00:11:12,210 --> 00:11:14,000
pop out spans a gully and then the
second principle is every pop-up

416
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:14,010
second principle is every pop-up

417
00:11:14,010 --> 00:11:15,860
second principle is every pop-up
misbalance on each side of the gully

418
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:15,870
misbalance on each side of the gully

419
00:11:15,870 --> 00:11:18,500
misbalance on each side of the gully
with v-folds where the crease is all

420
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:18,510
with v-folds where the crease is all

421
00:11:18,510 --> 00:11:20,000
with v-folds where the crease is all
converge at the same point

422
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:20,010
converge at the same point

423
00:11:20,010 --> 00:11:23,090
converge at the same point
it's the angles at balance so the angles

424
00:11:23,090 --> 00:11:23,100
it's the angles at balance so the angles

425
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:25,040
it's the angles at balance so the angles
on the base here are both the same size

426
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:25,050
on the base here are both the same size

427
00:11:25,050 --> 00:11:27,500
on the base here are both the same size
the angles on the pop up are both the

428
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:27,510
the angles on the pop up are both the

429
00:11:27,510 --> 00:11:31,160
the angles on the pop up are both the
same size so if we call this a and this

430
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:31,170
same size so if we call this a and this

431
00:11:31,170 --> 00:11:34,250
same size so if we call this a and this
B we've got a plus B on one side we've

432
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:34,260
B we've got a plus B on one side we've

433
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:36,230
B we've got a plus B on one side we've
got a plus B on the other side so the

434
00:11:36,230 --> 00:11:36,240
got a plus B on the other side so the

435
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:41,260
got a plus B on the other side so the
angles balanced this is the basic v-fold

436
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:41,270
angles balanced this is the basic v-fold

we've just made this is the right angle
v-folds the angles on the pop-up are

448
00:11:58,370 --> 00:11:58,380
v-folds the angles on the pop-up are

449
00:11:58,380 --> 00:12:05,720
v-folds the angles on the pop-up are
both 90 degrees this is the acute angle

450
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:05,730

v-fold the angles on the pop-up they're

453
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:09,920
v-fold the angles on the pop-up they're
still both the same but the angles are

454
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:09,930
still both the same but the angles are

455
00:12:09,930 --> 00:12:15,830
still both the same but the angles are
both less than 90 degrees this one is

456
00:12:15,830 --> 00:12:15,840
both less than 90 degrees this one is

457
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:18,020
both less than 90 degrees this one is
the pointy v-folds this is a variation

458
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:18,030
the pointy v-folds this is a variation

459
00:12:18,030 --> 00:12:20,510
the pointy v-folds this is a variation
on this acute angle but in this case

460
00:12:20,510 --> 00:12:20,520
on this acute angle but in this case

461
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:24,770
on this acute angle but in this case
even more extreme this is the this is

462
00:12:24,770 --> 00:12:24,780
even more extreme this is the this is

463
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:27,980
even more extreme this is the this is
the obtuse angle default so the angles

464
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:27,990
the obtuse angle default so the angles

465
00:12:27,990 --> 00:12:29,960
the obtuse angle default so the angles
on the pop-up are both more than 90

466
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:29,970
on the pop-up are both more than 90

467
00:12:29,970 --> 00:12:31,460
on the pop-up are both more than 90
degrees they're still the same on each

468
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:31,470
degrees they're still the same on each

469
00:12:31,470 --> 00:12:34,130
degrees they're still the same on each
side and the angles on the on the base

470
00:12:34,130 --> 00:12:34,140
side and the angles on the on the base

471
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:36,110
side and the angles on the on the base
are still the same on each side so

472
00:12:36,110 --> 00:12:36,120
are still the same on each side so

473
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:38,570
are still the same on each side so
you've got balance and then this is the

474
00:12:38,570 --> 00:12:38,580
you've got balance and then this is the

475
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:41,030
you've got balance and then this is the
final most most intriguing of the

00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:41,040
final most most intriguing of the

477
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,830
final most most intriguing of the
v-folds really this is the asymmetric

478
00:12:42,830 --> 00:12:42,840
v-folds really this is the asymmetric

479
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:46,160
v-folds really this is the asymmetric
v-fold so the angles on each side on the

480
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:46,170
v-fold so the angles on each side on the

481
00:12:46,170 --> 00:12:49,160
v-fold so the angles on each side on the
pop-up are different and the angles on

482
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:49,170
pop-up are different and the angles on

483
00:12:49,170 --> 00:12:50,840
pop-up are different and the angles on
the base are different you've got four

484
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:50,850
the base are different you've got four

485
00:12:50,850 --> 00:12:53,630
the base are different you've got four
different angles but the angle on the

486
00:12:53,630 --> 00:12:53,640
different angles but the angle on the

487
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:56,330
different angles but the angle on the
base on one side plus the angle on the

488
00:12:56,330 --> 00:12:56,340
base on one side plus the angle on the

489
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:59,240
base on one side plus the angle on the
pop-up equals the angle on the base on

490
00:12:59,240 --> 00:12:59,250
pop-up equals the angle on the base on

491
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:01,430
pop-up equals the angle on the base on
the other side plus the angle on the

492
00:13:01,430 --> 00:13:01,440
the other side plus the angle on the

493
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,500
the other side plus the angle on the
pop-up so you still have balance even

494
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:03,510
pop-up so you still have balance even

495
00:13:03,510 --> 00:13:07,580
pop-up so you still have balance even
though all four angles are different

496
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:07,590


497
00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:09,830
[Music]

498
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:09,840
[Music]

499
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:12,720
[Music]
now I'll make a pop-up version of the

500
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:12,730
now I'll make a pop-up version of the

501
00:13:12,730 --> 00:13:37,110
now I'll make a pop-up version of the
parallel fold take another base and

502
00:13:37,110 --> 00:13:37,120
parallel fold take another base and

503
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:39,300
parallel fold take another base and
here's a pop up piece so this is

504
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:39,310
here's a pop up piece so this is

505
00:13:39,310 --> 00:13:40,440
here's a pop up piece so this is
parallel fold

506
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:40,450
parallel fold

507
00:13:40,450 --> 00:13:43,770
parallel fold
so in this case we make the the fold at

508
00:13:43,770 --> 00:13:43,780
so in this case we make the the fold at

509
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:47,670
so in this case we make the the fold at
the outer edges when you make when you

510
00:13:47,670 --> 00:13:47,680
the outer edges when you make when you

511
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:49,800
the outer edges when you make when you
make gluing tabs they should never be

512
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:49,810
make gluing tabs they should never be

513
00:13:49,810 --> 00:13:53,940
make gluing tabs they should never be
less than half an inch or one centimeter

514
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:53,950
less than half an inch or one centimeter

515
00:13:53,950 --> 00:13:56,700
less than half an inch or one centimeter
because pop-ups tend to they generate

516
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:56,710
because pop-ups tend to they generate

517
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:59,730
because pop-ups tend to they generate
quite a lot of stress on the tabs so you

518
00:13:59,730 --> 00:13:59,740
quite a lot of stress on the tabs so you

519
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:03,450
quite a lot of stress on the tabs so you
need them to be fairly wide to take the

520
00:14:03,450 --> 00:14:03,460
need them to be fairly wide to take the

521
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:06,120
need them to be fairly wide to take the
stress of opening and closing so this is

522
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:06,130
stress of opening and closing so this is

523
00:14:06,130 --> 00:14:08,220
stress of opening and closing so this is
going to be the parallel fold and you

524
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:08,230
going to be the parallel fold and you

525
00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:10,110
going to be the parallel fold and you
can actually play around with these you

526
00:14:10,110 --> 00:14:10,120
can actually play around with these you

527
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:12,180
can actually play around with these you
can have it really wide on the page or

528
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:12,190
can have it really wide on the page or

529
00:14:12,190 --> 00:14:15,420
can have it really wide on the page or
you can have it pretty close I tend to

530
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:15,430
you can have it pretty close I tend to

531
00:14:15,430 --> 00:14:19,320
you can have it pretty close I tend to
actually cut off the corners of gluing

532
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:19,330
actually cut off the corners of gluing

533
00:14:19,330 --> 00:14:23,820
actually cut off the corners of gluing
tabs I just think the when they're under

534
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:23,830
tabs I just think the when they're under

535
00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:25,920
tabs I just think the when they're under
a bit less sharp they tend to snag less

536
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:25,930
a bit less sharp they tend to snag less

537
00:14:25,930 --> 00:14:28,710
a bit less sharp they tend to snag less
it doesn't matter whether whether

538
00:14:28,710 --> 00:14:28,720
it doesn't matter whether whether

539
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:32,220
it doesn't matter whether whether
they're inside like this or whether

540
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:32,230
they're inside like this or whether

541
00:14:32,230 --> 00:14:36,240
they're inside like this or whether
they're outside like this you can you

542
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:36,250
they're outside like this you can you

543
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:38,160
they're outside like this you can you
know that the position of the tab

544
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:38,170
know that the position of the tab

545
00:14:38,170 --> 00:14:39,750
know that the position of the tab
doesn't matter the only thing that

546
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:39,760
doesn't matter the only thing that

547
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:43,020
doesn't matter the only thing that
matters is the position of the crease so

548
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:43,030
matters is the position of the crease so

549
00:14:43,030 --> 00:14:45,510
matters is the position of the crease so
here is by put by folding it in half and

550
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:45,520
here is by put by folding it in half and

551
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:47,610
here is by put by folding it in half and
then folding the tabs on we've got

552
00:14:47,610 --> 00:14:47,620
then folding the tabs on we've got

553
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:49,680
then folding the tabs on we've got
balance on the pop-up piece the lengths

554
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:49,690
balance on the pop-up piece the lengths

555
00:14:49,690 --> 00:14:53,610
balance on the pop-up piece the lengths
both sides are the same so again we just

556
00:14:53,610 --> 00:14:53,620
both sides are the same so again we just

557
00:14:53,620 --> 00:15:02,720
both sides are the same so again we just
put glue on glue on one side

558
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:02,730


559
00:15:02,730 --> 00:15:08,940
snoo on well right up to the crease I'm

560
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:08,950
snoo on well right up to the crease I'm

561
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:10,980
snoo on well right up to the crease I'm
gonna have these these tabs on the

562
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:10,990
gonna have these these tabs on the

563
00:15:10,990 --> 00:15:14,370
gonna have these these tabs on the
inside so we'll stick it down there the

564
00:15:14,370 --> 00:15:14,380
inside so we'll stick it down there the

565
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:16,550
inside so we'll stick it down there the
crease is parallel to the central gully

566
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:16,560
crease is parallel to the central gully

567
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:20,400
crease is parallel to the central gully
then fold the whole piece shut put glue

568
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:20,410
then fold the whole piece shut put glue

569
00:15:20,410 --> 00:15:31,400
then fold the whole piece shut put glue
on the other tab smear it up to the edge

570
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:31,410


571
00:15:31,410 --> 00:15:34,020
and close the base so it finds its

572
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:34,030
and close the base so it finds its

573
00:15:34,030 --> 00:15:42,320
and close the base so it finds its
natural sticking position so this is a

574
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:42,330
natural sticking position so this is a

575
00:15:42,330 --> 00:15:44,700
natural sticking position so this is a
this is a parallel fold this is a

576
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:44,710
this is a parallel fold this is a

577
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:51,120
this is a parallel fold this is a
symmetric parallel fold there are three

578
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:51,130
symmetric parallel fold there are three

579
00:15:51,130 --> 00:15:54,870
symmetric parallel fold there are three
kinds of parallel fold this is the this

580
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:54,880
kinds of parallel fold this is the this

581
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:58,140
kinds of parallel fold this is the this
is a symmetric equal parallel fold both

582
00:15:58,140 --> 00:15:58,150
is a symmetric equal parallel fold both

583
00:15:58,150 --> 00:16:00,570
is a symmetric equal parallel fold both
both sides are the same both lengths on

584
00:16:00,570 --> 00:16:00,580
both sides are the same both lengths on

585
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:03,300
both sides are the same both lengths on
the on the pop-up at the same and the

586
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:03,310
the on the pop-up at the same and the

587
00:16:03,310 --> 00:16:05,340
the on the pop-up at the same and the
distance from where it glues down to the

588
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:05,350
distance from where it glues down to the

589
00:16:05,350 --> 00:16:07,560
distance from where it glues down to the
spine is the same so on the left you've

590
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:07,570
spine is the same so on the left you've

591
00:16:07,570 --> 00:16:09,480
spine is the same so on the left you've
got a short bit on the base and a long

592
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:09,490
got a short bit on the base and a long

593
00:16:09,490 --> 00:16:11,850
got a short bit on the base and a long
bit on the pop-up on the right you've

594
00:16:11,850 --> 00:16:11,860
bit on the pop-up on the right you've

595
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:13,920
bit on the pop-up on the right you've
got a short bit on the base and along

596
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:13,930
got a short bit on the base and along

597
00:16:13,930 --> 00:16:16,620
got a short bit on the base and along
with it on the pop-up this is the second

598
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:16,630
with it on the pop-up this is the second

599
00:16:16,630 --> 00:16:18,180
with it on the pop-up this is the second
type of parallel fold this is the

600
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:18,190
type of parallel fold this is the

601
00:16:18,190 --> 00:16:20,370
type of parallel fold this is the
parallelogram you look at it this way on

602
00:16:20,370 --> 00:16:20,380
parallelogram you look at it this way on

603
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:23,820
parallelogram you look at it this way on
and you can see on one side on the left

604
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:23,830
and you can see on one side on the left

605
00:16:23,830 --> 00:16:26,490
and you can see on one side on the left
you've got a short length on the pop-up

606
00:16:26,490 --> 00:16:26,500
you've got a short length on the pop-up

607
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:29,040
you've got a short length on the pop-up
and they're long lengths on the base on

608
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:29,050
and they're long lengths on the base on

609
00:16:29,050 --> 00:16:31,020
and they're long lengths on the base on
the right you've got a short length on

610
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:31,030
the right you've got a short length on

611
00:16:31,030 --> 00:16:32,820
the right you've got a short length on
the base and a long length on the pop-up

612
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:32,830
the base and a long length on the pop-up

613
00:16:32,830 --> 00:16:35,220
the base and a long length on the pop-up
so again you've got balance the length

614
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:35,230
so again you've got balance the length

615
00:16:35,230 --> 00:16:40,140
so again you've got balance the length
balance and the last one this is the

616
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:40,150
balance and the last one this is the

617
00:16:40,150 --> 00:16:43,770
balance and the last one this is the
this is the asymmetric parallel fold so

618
00:16:43,770 --> 00:16:43,780
this is the asymmetric parallel fold so

619
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:46,620
this is the asymmetric parallel fold so
all four lengths are different so on the

620
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:46,630
all four lengths are different so on the

621
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:48,840
all four lengths are different so on the
Left you've got quite a long bit on the

622
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:48,850
Left you've got quite a long bit on the

623
00:16:48,850 --> 00:16:50,670
Left you've got quite a long bit on the
base and the short bit on the pop-up on

624
00:16:50,670 --> 00:16:50,680
base and the short bit on the pop-up on

625
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:53,310
base and the short bit on the pop-up on
the right you've got a short bit on the

626
00:16:53,310 --> 00:16:53,320
the right you've got a short bit on the

627
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:55,110
the right you've got a short bit on the
base and a long bit on the pop-up

628
00:16:55,110 --> 00:16:55,120
base and a long bit on the pop-up

629
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:58,200
base and a long bit on the pop-up
so as the whole thing closes you can see

630
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:58,210
so as the whole thing closes you can see

631
00:16:58,210 --> 00:17:00,780
so as the whole thing closes you can see
from the spine fold to the leading

632
00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:00,790
from the spine fold to the leading

633
00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:03,240
from the spine fold to the leading
leading fold the two sides are the same

634
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:03,250
leading fold the two sides are the same

635
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:08,670
leading fold the two sides are the same
the the pop-up is balanced on v-folds is

636
00:17:08,670 --> 00:17:08,680
the the pop-up is balanced on v-folds is

637
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:11,760
the the pop-up is balanced on v-folds is
the angles at balanced on parallel folds

638
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:11,770
the angles at balanced on parallel folds

639
00:17:11,770 --> 00:17:14,160
the angles at balanced on parallel folds
it's the lengths at balance and the

640
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:14,170
it's the lengths at balance and the

641
00:17:14,170 --> 00:17:15,010
it's the lengths at balance and the
third

642
00:17:15,010 --> 00:17:15,020
third

643
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:19,120
third
the third principle is that every pop-up

644
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:19,130
the third principle is that every pop-up

645
00:17:19,130 --> 00:17:27,790
the third principle is that every pop-up
creates gullies so the first principle

646
00:17:27,790 --> 00:17:27,800
creates gullies so the first principle

647
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:30,380
creates gullies so the first principle
every pop-up my spanner gully and the

648
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:30,390
every pop-up my spanner gully and the

649
00:17:30,390 --> 00:17:32,780
every pop-up my spanner gully and the
first gully is the spine fold the second

650
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:32,790
first gully is the spine fold the second

651
00:17:32,790 --> 00:17:34,910
first gully is the spine fold the second
principle every pop-up must balance on

652
00:17:34,910 --> 00:17:34,920
principle every pop-up must balance on

653
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:37,760
principle every pop-up must balance on
each site v-folds it's the angles

654
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:37,770
each site v-folds it's the angles

655
00:17:37,770 --> 00:17:40,310
each site v-folds it's the angles
balanced parallel folds it's the length

656
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:40,320
balanced parallel folds it's the length

657
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:42,230
balanced parallel folds it's the length
of balance and then the third principle

658
00:17:42,230 --> 00:17:42,240
of balance and then the third principle

659
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:44,630
of balance and then the third principle
is that every pop-up creates gullies and

660
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:44,640
is that every pop-up creates gullies and

661
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:47,630
is that every pop-up creates gullies and
you can stick pop-ups into those gullies

662
00:17:47,630 --> 00:17:47,640
you can stick pop-ups into those gullies

663
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:49,910
you can stick pop-ups into those gullies
so here's a gully on a parallel fold you

664
00:17:49,910 --> 00:17:49,920
so here's a gully on a parallel fold you

665
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:52,100
so here's a gully on a parallel fold you
could stick this in like this or you

666
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:52,110
could stick this in like this or you

667
00:17:52,110 --> 00:17:54,380
could stick this in like this or you
could stick this this one in like this

668
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:54,390
could stick this this one in like this

669
00:17:54,390 --> 00:17:58,210
could stick this this one in like this
and on on the V folds again you've got

670
00:17:58,210 --> 00:17:58,220
and on on the V folds again you've got

671
00:17:58,220 --> 00:18:00,800
and on on the V folds again you've got
you've got these gullies you can stick

672
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:00,810
you've got these gullies you can stick

673
00:18:00,810 --> 00:18:03,320
you've got these gullies you can stick
it into on the back as the page closes

674
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:03,330
it into on the back as the page closes

675
00:18:03,330 --> 00:18:06,530
it into on the back as the page closes
the the pop-up will close or you've also

676
00:18:06,530 --> 00:18:06,540
the the pop-up will close or you've also

677
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:09,680
the the pop-up will close or you've also
got a gully here you can stick there you

678
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:09,690
got a gully here you can stick there you

679
00:18:09,690 --> 00:18:11,660
got a gully here you can stick there you
can stick the pop-up into the gully you

680
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:11,670
can stick the pop-up into the gully you

681
00:18:11,670 --> 00:18:14,600
can stick the pop-up into the gully you
can stick it any height you like in some

682
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:14,610
can stick it any height you like in some

683
00:18:14,610 --> 00:18:21,320
can stick it any height you like in some

of pop-up there's three ways you can use

708
00:18:56,990 --> 00:18:57,000
of pop-up there's three ways you can use

709
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,540
of pop-up there's three ways you can use
the base either the base can either be a

710
00:18:59,540 --> 00:18:59,550
the base either the base can either be a

711
00:18:59,550 --> 00:19:02,420
the base either the base can either be a
base that the pop-up rises from it can

712
00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:02,430
base that the pop-up rises from it can

713
00:19:02,430 --> 00:19:04,250
base that the pop-up rises from it can
be a background that the pop-up comes

714
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:04,260
be a background that the pop-up comes

715
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:07,040
be a background that the pop-up comes
forward from or it can be a base and a

716
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:07,050
forward from or it can be a base and a

717
00:19:07,050 --> 00:19:09,440
forward from or it can be a base and a
background and with the pop-up stuck

718
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:09,450
background and with the pop-up stuck

719
00:19:09,450 --> 00:19:12,020
background and with the pop-up stuck
into the gummy so the first one I'd like

720
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:12,030
into the gummy so the first one I'd like

721
00:19:12,030 --> 00:19:14,870
into the gummy so the first one I'd like
to show you is this is Christopher

this is using this is using the base as

728
00:19:22,970 --> 00:19:22,980
this is using this is using the base as

729
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:25,910
this is using this is using the base as
a as a base with the pop-up rising from

730
00:19:25,910 --> 00:19:25,920
a as a base with the pop-up rising from

731
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:26,690
a as a base with the pop-up rising from
it

732
00:19:26,690 --> 00:19:26,700
it

733
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:31,370
it
there is and this is if you actually

734
00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:31,380
there is and this is if you actually

735
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:34,310
there is and this is if you actually
look at it from the top you can see it's

736
00:19:34,310 --> 00:19:34,320
look at it from the top you can see it's

737
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:36,650
look at it from the top you can see it's
based on v-folds although where it's

738
00:19:36,650 --> 00:19:36,660
based on v-folds although where it's

739
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:39,260
based on v-folds although where it's
glued to the page all the creases will

740
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:39,270
glued to the page all the creases will

741
00:19:39,270 --> 00:19:42,590
glued to the page all the creases will
converge at the same point so this is

742
00:19:42,590 --> 00:19:42,600
converge at the same point so this is

743
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:47,030
converge at the same point so this is
this is a pop-up using using the base as

744
00:19:47,030 --> 00:19:47,040
this is a pop-up using using the base as

745
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:51,700
this is a pop-up using using the base as
a base with the pop-up rising from it

746
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:51,710


747
00:19:51,710 --> 00:19:54,710
the second way you can you can use the

748
00:19:54,710 --> 00:19:54,720
the second way you can you can use the

749
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,680
the second way you can you can use the
base is with the base as a background

750
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:56,690
base is with the base as a background

751
00:19:56,690 --> 00:19:59,090
base is with the base as a background
with the pop-up coming forward from it

752
00:19:59,090 --> 00:19:59,100
with the pop-up coming forward from it

753
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:01,490
with the pop-up coming forward from it
this is the little fish who cried shark

754
00:20:01,490 --> 00:20:01,500
this is the little fish who cried shark

755
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:05,870
this is the little fish who cried shark
so if we open this one up this is using

756
00:20:05,870 --> 00:20:05,880
so if we open this one up this is using

757
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:09,680
so if we open this one up this is using
the the base as a background so you've

758
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:09,690
the the base as a background so you've

759
00:20:09,690 --> 00:20:11,480
the the base as a background so you've
got the pop-up coming forward from it

760
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:11,490
got the pop-up coming forward from it

761
00:20:11,490 --> 00:20:14,210
got the pop-up coming forward from it
and in this case again both both halves

762
00:20:14,210 --> 00:20:14,220
and in this case again both both halves

763
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:16,430
and in this case again both both halves
of the design they're based on V folds

764
00:20:16,430 --> 00:20:16,440
of the design they're based on V folds

765
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:18,950
of the design they're based on V folds
and they look to me like a symmetric

766
00:20:18,950 --> 00:20:18,960
and they look to me like a symmetric

767
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:22,040
and they look to me like a symmetric
v-folds so the angles on the two pop up

768
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:22,050
v-folds so the angles on the two pop up

769
00:20:22,050 --> 00:20:25,520
v-folds so the angles on the two pop up
each side of the popups are different so

770
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:25,530
each side of the popups are different so

771
00:20:25,530 --> 00:20:28,430
each side of the popups are different so
this is using the pop-up as a as a

772
00:20:28,430 --> 00:20:28,440
this is using the pop-up as a as a

773
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:33,200
this is using the pop-up as a as a
background and the third kind is a it's

774
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:33,210
background and the third kind is a it's

775
00:20:33,210 --> 00:20:36,110
background and the third kind is a it's
another capacitor again it's from the

776
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:36,120
another capacitor again it's from the

777
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:41,200
another capacitor again it's from the
50s it's the base and the background so

778
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:41,210
50s it's the base and the background so

779
00:20:41,210 --> 00:20:44,750
50s it's the base and the background so
so that that's the last thing I want to

780
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:44,760
so that that's the last thing I want to

781
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:47,900
so that that's the last thing I want to
talk about really techniques and then

782
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:47,910
talk about really techniques and then

783
00:20:47,910 --> 00:20:49,430
talk about really techniques and then
the last thing I'd like to say is almost

784
00:20:49,430 --> 00:20:49,440
the last thing I'd like to say is almost

785
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:52,220
the last thing I'd like to say is almost
all all popups use a combination of

786
00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:52,230
all all popups use a combination of

787
00:20:52,230 --> 00:20:54,890
all all popups use a combination of
mechanisms so I've got a few examples

788
00:20:54,890 --> 00:20:54,900
mechanisms so I've got a few examples

789
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:58,910
mechanisms so I've got a few examples
here this is when I made this is this is

790
00:20:58,910 --> 00:20:58,920
here this is when I made this is this is

791
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:02,120
here this is when I made this is this is
V folds all three folds and then this V

792
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:02,130
V folds all three folds and then this V

793
00:21:02,130 --> 00:21:04,880
V folds all three folds and then this V
fold at the front is raising raising

794
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:04,890
fold at the front is raising raising

795
00:21:04,890 --> 00:21:07,760
fold at the front is raising raising
this the dog and the dog is made of a

796
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:07,770
this the dog and the dog is made of a

797
00:21:07,770 --> 00:21:10,970
this the dog and the dog is made of a
whole series of parallelograms so this

798
00:21:10,970 --> 00:21:10,980
whole series of parallelograms so this

799
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:12,860
whole series of parallelograms so this
is a combination this design is a

800
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:12,870
is a combination this design is a

801
00:21:12,870 --> 00:21:14,720
is a combination this design is a
combination of V folds and

802
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:14,730
combination of V folds and

803
00:21:14,730 --> 00:21:19,730
combination of V folds and
parallelograms and then this is a this

804
00:21:19,730 --> 00:21:19,740
parallelograms and then this is a this

805
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:21,890
parallelograms and then this is a this
is a really early pop-up this pop-up is

00:21:21,890 --> 00:21:21,900
is a really early pop-up this pop-up is

807
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:24,290
is a really early pop-up this pop-up is
from the 30s this is from a series

808
00:21:24,290 --> 00:21:24,300
from the 30s this is from a series

00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:27,200
from the 30s this is from a series
called the Baccano series and this is

810
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:27,210
called the Baccano series and this is

811
00:21:27,210 --> 00:21:30,080
called the Baccano series and this is
number 15 I think they're about 30 and

812
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:30,090
number 15 I think they're about 30 and

813
00:21:30,090 --> 00:21:33,020
number 15 I think they're about 30 and
the designer was a guy called Louisa

814
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:33,030
the designer was a guy called Louisa

815
00:21:33,030 --> 00:21:36,560
the designer was a guy called Louisa
roan and so here is this is a this is a

816
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:36,570
roan and so here is this is a this is a

817
00:21:36,570 --> 00:21:39,380
roan and so here is this is a this is a
pop-up again you can see the the basic

818
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:39,390
pop-up again you can see the the basic

819
00:21:39,390 --> 00:21:39,950
pop-up again you can see the the basic
part

820
00:21:39,950 --> 00:21:39,960
part

821
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:42,770
part
is a v-fold and the v-fold is raising

822
00:21:42,770 --> 00:21:42,780
is a v-fold and the v-fold is raising

823
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:44,930
is a v-fold and the v-fold is raising
parallelograms raising these other

824
00:21:44,930 --> 00:21:44,940
parallelograms raising these other

825
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:47,180
parallelograms raising these other
images so if you look at it this way

826
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:47,190
images so if you look at it this way

827
00:21:47,190 --> 00:21:49,340
images so if you look at it this way
around you'll see that these other

828
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:49,350
around you'll see that these other

829
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:52,070
around you'll see that these other
images of parallelograms raised by the

830
00:21:52,070 --> 00:21:52,080
images of parallelograms raised by the

831
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:54,970
images of parallelograms raised by the
v-fold

832
00:21:54,970 --> 00:21:54,980


833
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:58,550
and then this is a more modern one this

834
00:21:58,550 --> 00:21:58,560
and then this is a more modern one this

835
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:02,420
and then this is a more modern one this
is David Pellom Appleby's shapes and
