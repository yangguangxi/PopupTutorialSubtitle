00:04:46,599 --> 00:04:51,839
showing you so that's the minuet the
next most simple is the conductor so

166
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:51,849
next most simple is the conductor so

167
00:04:51,849 --> 00:04:54,870
next most simple is the conductor so
here's the conductor this is the piece

168
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:54,880
here's the conductor this is the piece

169
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:57,029
here's the conductor this is the piece
that would be his arm so this is a

170
00:04:57,029 --> 00:04:57,039
that would be his arm so this is a

171
00:04:57,039 --> 00:05:00,120
that would be his arm so this is a
Valley fold this is a mountain fold this

172
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:00,130
Valley fold this is a mountain fold this

173
00:05:00,130 --> 00:05:03,000
Valley fold this is a mountain fold this
is also a mountain fold this here is a

174
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:03,010
is also a mountain fold this here is a

175
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:06,330
is also a mountain fold this here is a
Valley fold this is a mountain fold this

176
00:05:06,330 --> 00:05:06,340
Valley fold this is a mountain fold this

177
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:08,459
Valley fold this is a mountain fold this
is a valley fold when it's all put

178
00:05:08,459 --> 00:05:08,469
is a valley fold when it's all put

179
00:05:08,469 --> 00:05:09,470
is a valley fold when it's all put
together this is

180
00:05:09,470 --> 00:05:09,480
together this is

181
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:12,370
together this is
it looks like this is the top of the box

182
00:05:12,370 --> 00:05:12,380
it looks like this is the top of the box

183
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:14,720
it looks like this is the top of the box
this is his arm that's going to swing

184
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:14,730
this is his arm that's going to swing

185
00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:16,850
this is his arm that's going to swing
around so when the whole spread is

186
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:16,860
around so when the whole spread is

187
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:19,190
around so when the whole spread is
closed it's right back like that and

188
00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:19,200
closed it's right back like that and

189
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:21,980
closed it's right back like that and
then as the spread opens the top of the

190
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:21,990
then as the spread opens the top of the

191
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:24,560
then as the spread opens the top of the
box opens and his arm moves right round

192
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:24,570
box opens and his arm moves right round

193
00:05:24,570 --> 00:05:27,260
box opens and his arm moves right round
and again up maybe I didn't say this

194
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:27,270
and again up maybe I didn't say this

195
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:29,030
and again up maybe I didn't say this
where I've scribbled that's where it's

196
00:05:29,030 --> 00:05:29,040
where I've scribbled that's where it's

197
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,920
where I've scribbled that's where it's
glued together see look at this you can

198
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:30,930
glued together see look at this you can

199
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:33,230
glued together see look at this you can
see that's where it's glued together so

200
00:05:33,230 --> 00:05:33,240
see that's where it's glued together so

201
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:35,630
see that's where it's glued together so
you just have another look at this you

202
00:05:35,630 --> 00:05:35,640
you just have another look at this you

203
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:37,970
you just have another look at this you
can see maybe if I hold it round this

204
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:37,980
can see maybe if I hold it round this

205
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:40,580
can see maybe if I hold it round this
way you can see the top of the box is a

206
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:40,590
way you can see the top of the box is a

207
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:43,400
way you can see the top of the box is a
valley then there's a mountain the top

208
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:43,410
valley then there's a mountain the top

209
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:45,500
valley then there's a mountain the top
of this is a mountain but you've got

210
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:45,510
of this is a mountain but you've got

211
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:47,900
of this is a mountain but you've got
this mountain valley in between and that

212
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:47,910
this mountain valley in between and that

213
00:05:47,910 --> 00:05:51,860
this mountain valley in between and that
gives you that magnificent movement

214
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:51,870
gives you that magnificent movement

215
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:55,610
gives you that magnificent movement
so if I just explain with that using the

216
00:05:55,610 --> 00:05:55,620
so if I just explain with that using the

217
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:58,740
so if I just explain with that using the
box mechanism so you get an idea I'll

218
00:05:58,740 --> 00:05:58,750
box mechanism so you get an idea I'll

219
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:00,990
box mechanism so you get an idea I'll
swivel it round so you can see how it is

220
00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:01,000
swivel it round so you can see how it is

221
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,330
swivel it round so you can see how it is
from the side as it closes the top of

222
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:03,340
from the side as it closes the top of

223
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:05,670
from the side as it closes the top of
the box closes and the arm goes back as

224
00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:05,680
the box closes and the arm goes back as

225
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:09,600
the box closes and the arm goes back as
the page opens the top of the box opens

226
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:09,610
the page opens the top of the box opens

227
00:06:09,610 --> 00:06:12,420
the page opens the top of the box opens
the top of this mechanism opens and the

228
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:12,430
the top of this mechanism opens and the

229
00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:17,410
the top of this mechanism opens and the
arm comes down so that's the conductor

230
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:17,420
arm comes down so that's the conductor

231
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:20,680
arm comes down so that's the conductor
and then the last one I want to show you

232
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:20,690
and then the last one I want to show you

233
00:06:20,690 --> 00:06:23,350
and then the last one I want to show you
is the it's actually the earliest one

234
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:23,360
is the it's actually the earliest one

235
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,630
is the it's actually the earliest one

annuals this is the dog dog has two

238
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:28,550
annuals this is the dog dog has two

239
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:30,790
annuals this is the dog dog has two
mechanism says the tail and the head and

240
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:30,800
mechanism says the tail and the head and

241
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:34,240
mechanism says the tail and the head and
they both move as the spread opens you

242
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:34,250
they both move as the spread opens you

243
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:37,240
they both move as the spread opens you
see the dog's head starts off up and as

244
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:37,250
see the dog's head starts off up and as

245
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:39,790
see the dog's head starts off up and as
the spread opens the dog's head drops

246
00:06:39,790 --> 00:06:39,800
the spread opens the dog's head drops

247
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:42,010
the spread opens the dog's head drops
all the way down the tail does the

248
00:06:42,010 --> 00:06:42,020
all the way down the tail does the

249
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:44,590
all the way down the tail does the
opposite when the spread is closed the

250
00:06:44,590 --> 00:06:44,600
opposite when the spread is closed the

251
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:47,920
opposite when the spread is closed the
tail is down and as the spread opens the

252
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:47,930
tail is down and as the spread opens the

253
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:51,310
tail is down and as the spread opens the
tail comes up so now I'll explain that

254
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:51,320
tail comes up so now I'll explain that

255
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:55,090
tail comes up so now I'll explain that
one I've got two examples here this is

256
00:06:55,090 --> 00:06:55,100
one I've got two examples here this is

257
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:57,640
one I've got two examples here this is
the tail section this is the back this

258
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:57,650
the tail section this is the back this

259
00:06:57,650 --> 00:07:00,280
the tail section this is the back this
is the tail when it's closed it's down

260
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:00,290
is the tail when it's closed it's down

261
00:07:00,290 --> 00:07:03,940
is the tail when it's closed it's down
as the spread opens the tail comes up I

262
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:03,950
as the spread opens the tail comes up I

263
00:07:03,950 --> 00:07:08,980
as the spread opens the tail comes up I
can show it to you on here this is it

264
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:08,990
can show it to you on here this is it

265
00:07:08,990 --> 00:07:11,710
can show it to you on here this is it
this is the box this is the tail when

266
00:07:11,710 --> 00:07:11,720
this is the box this is the tail when

267
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:14,920
this is the box this is the tail when
the spread is closed the tail is down as

268
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:14,930
the spread is closed the tail is down as

269
00:07:14,930 --> 00:07:18,700
the spread is closed the tail is down as
it spread opens the tail comes up

270
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:18,710
it spread opens the tail comes up

271
00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:22,659
it spread opens the tail comes up
and the way the tail is made this is a

272
00:07:22,659 --> 00:07:22,669
and the way the tail is made this is a

273
00:07:22,669 --> 00:07:26,200
and the way the tail is made this is a
valley fold and then this is a this is a

274
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:26,210
valley fold and then this is a this is a

275
00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:28,900
valley fold and then this is a this is a
valley fold this is a mountain fold and

276
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:28,910
valley fold this is a mountain fold and

277
00:07:28,910 --> 00:07:30,909
valley fold this is a mountain fold and
then this is a valley fold so these two

278
00:07:30,909 --> 00:07:30,919
then this is a valley fold so these two

279
00:07:30,919 --> 00:07:32,590
then this is a valley fold so these two
pieces will come together and be glued

280
00:07:32,590 --> 00:07:32,600
pieces will come together and be glued

281
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:35,680
pieces will come together and be glued
so here it is you can see it's a valley

282
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:35,690
so here it is you can see it's a valley

283
00:07:35,690 --> 00:07:38,499
so here it is you can see it's a valley
fold two Valley folds two mountain folds

284
00:07:38,499 --> 00:07:38,509
fold two Valley folds two mountain folds

285
00:07:38,509 --> 00:07:40,779
fold two Valley folds two mountain folds
and then the bottom of this is a valley

286
00:07:40,779 --> 00:07:40,789
and then the bottom of this is a valley

287
00:07:40,789 --> 00:07:42,870
and then the bottom of this is a valley
fold with the two pieces stuck together

288
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:42,880
fold with the two pieces stuck together

289
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:47,080
fold with the two pieces stuck together
so that's the tail of the dog and then

290
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:47,090
so that's the tail of the dog and then

291
00:07:47,090 --> 00:07:51,249
so that's the tail of the dog and then
this is the head of the dog the head of

292
00:07:51,249 --> 00:07:51,259
this is the head of the dog the head of

293
00:07:51,259 --> 00:07:53,460
this is the head of the dog the head of
the dog is bit more complicated as you

294
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:53,470
the dog is bit more complicated as you

295
00:07:53,470 --> 00:07:58,180
the dog is bit more complicated as you
open and close it it starts up and as

296
00:07:58,180 --> 00:07:58,190
open and close it it starts up and as

297
00:07:58,190 --> 00:08:02,350
open and close it it starts up and as
you open it the head comes down I can

298
00:08:02,350 --> 00:08:02,360
you open it the head comes down I can

299
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:07,210
you open it the head comes down I can
put it on here as the base is closed the

300
00:08:07,210 --> 00:08:07,220
put it on here as the base is closed the

301
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:10,120
put it on here as the base is closed the
top of the box is closed as the base

302
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:10,130
top of the box is closed as the base

303
00:08:10,130 --> 00:08:13,870
top of the box is closed as the base
opens the top of the box opens and the

304
00:08:13,870 --> 00:08:13,880
opens the top of the box opens and the

305
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:18,580
opens the top of the box opens and the
dog's head drops down I did make one

306
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:18,590
dog's head drops down I did make one

307
00:08:18,590 --> 00:08:25,600
dog's head drops down I did make one
here so here it is I messed up the tail

308
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:25,610
here so here it is I messed up the tail

309
00:08:25,610 --> 00:08:27,580
here so here it is I messed up the tail
so I cut that off but you can see this

310
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:27,590
so I cut that off but you can see this

311
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:30,909
so I cut that off but you can see this
is the box you can see there's a central

312
00:08:30,909 --> 00:08:30,919
is the box you can see there's a central

313
00:08:30,919 --> 00:08:33,760
is the box you can see there's a central
pillar that pushes up their needs when

314
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:33,770
pillar that pushes up their needs when

315
00:08:33,770 --> 00:08:36,730
pillar that pushes up their needs when
it's closed the dog's head is up as it

316
00:08:36,730 --> 00:08:36,740
it's closed the dog's head is up as it

317
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:40,149
it's closed the dog's head is up as it
opens the dog's head drops all the way

318
00:08:40,149 --> 00:08:40,159
opens the dog's head drops all the way

319
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:44,230
opens the dog's head drops all the way
down and in fact to get this shape this

320
00:08:44,230 --> 00:08:44,240
down and in fact to get this shape this

321
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:47,650
down and in fact to get this shape this
is just a straight strip of card this is

322
00:08:47,650 --> 00:08:47,660
is just a straight strip of card this is

323
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:49,990
is just a straight strip of card this is
the straight strip of card but to get

324
00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:50,000
the straight strip of card but to get

325
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,900
the straight strip of card but to get
this particular shape it's made with the

326
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:52,910
this particular shape it's made with the

327
00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:56,230
this particular shape it's made with the
two sides both Bend in different ways so

328
00:08:56,230 --> 00:08:56,240
two sides both Bend in different ways so

329
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,800
two sides both Bend in different ways so
when you look at the actual model

330
00:08:58,800 --> 00:08:58,810
when you look at the actual model

331
00:08:58,810 --> 00:09:01,990
when you look at the actual model
there's a hole in the top the way the

332
00:09:01,990 --> 00:09:02,000
there's a hole in the top the way the

333
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,150
there's a hole in the top the way the
dog's head is shaped the two sides

334
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:04,160
dog's head is shaped the two sides

335
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:06,460
dog's head is shaped the two sides
aren't made from one strip or they are

336
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:06,470
aren't made from one strip or they are

337
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:09,940
aren't made from one strip or they are
but the two sides diverge so they had to

338
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:09,950
but the two sides diverge so they had to

339
00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:11,980
but the two sides diverge so they had to
be cut in a different shape to give you

340
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:11,990
be cut in a different shape to give you

341
00:09:11,990 --> 00:09:14,949
be cut in a different shape to give you
that exact shape so that is what I did

342
00:09:14,949 --> 00:09:14,959
that exact shape so that is what I did

343
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:19,329
that exact shape so that is what I did
here to give you even more and so if I

344
00:09:19,329 --> 00:09:19,339
here to give you even more and so if I

345
00:09:19,339 --> 00:09:22,480
here to give you even more and so if I
just explained that one it's quite

346
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:22,490
just explained that one it's quite

347
00:09:22,490 --> 00:09:25,329
just explained that one it's quite
complex this is the back of the dog this

348
00:09:25,329 --> 00:09:25,339
complex this is the back of the dog this

349
00:09:25,339 --> 00:09:27,610
complex this is the back of the dog this
short bit then you can see there's

350
00:09:27,610 --> 00:09:27,620
short bit then you can see there's

351
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:32,130
short bit then you can see there's
there's two there's two valley folds

352
00:09:32,130 --> 00:09:32,140
there's two there's two valley folds

353
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:34,140
there's two there's two valley folds
and then this short piece is a mountain

354
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:34,150
and then this short piece is a mountain

355
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:36,390
and then this short piece is a mountain
fold and then this long bit that's the

356
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:36,400
fold and then this long bit that's the

357
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:38,700
fold and then this long bit that's the
dog's head that is a valley fold and

358
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:38,710
dog's head that is a valley fold and

359
00:09:38,710 --> 00:09:41,070
dog's head that is a valley fold and
then you've got actually two mountain

360
00:09:41,070 --> 00:09:41,080
then you've got actually two mountain

361
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:46,340
then you've got actually two mountain
folds so you go valley mountain mountain

362
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:46,350
folds so you go valley mountain mountain

363
00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:50,100
folds so you go valley mountain mountain
all the angles are marked so the 105

364
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:50,110
all the angles are marked so the 105

365
00:09:50,110 --> 00:09:52,080
all the angles are marked so the 105
degrees that's what this big angle here

366
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:52,090
degrees that's what this big angle here

367
00:09:52,090 --> 00:09:54,660
degrees that's what this big angle here
the 80 degrees is this little one in

368
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:54,670
the 80 degrees is this little one in

369
00:09:54,670 --> 00:09:57,780
the 80 degrees is this little one in
there the 65 degrees is this one in

370
00:09:57,780 --> 00:09:57,790
there the 65 degrees is this one in

371
00:09:57,790 --> 00:10:00,510
there the 65 degrees is this one in
there and then when you look at this you

372
00:10:00,510 --> 00:10:00,520
there and then when you look at this you

373
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:02,760
there and then when you look at this you
can see here it starts with the valley

374
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:02,770
can see here it starts with the valley

375
00:10:02,770 --> 00:10:04,830
can see here it starts with the valley
fold so this first one is a valley fold

376
00:10:04,830 --> 00:10:04,840
fold so this first one is a valley fold

377
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:07,590
fold so this first one is a valley fold
then there's actually two mountain folds

378
00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:07,600
then there's actually two mountain folds

379
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,810
then there's actually two mountain folds
this one and this one are two mountain

380
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:09,820
this one and this one are two mountain

381
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:12,840
this one and this one are two mountain
folds and then you've got the dog's head

382
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:12,850
folds and then you've got the dog's head

383
00:10:12,850 --> 00:10:14,820
folds and then you've got the dog's head
and this piece here will it be another

384
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:14,830
and this piece here will it be another

385
00:10:14,830 --> 00:10:17,630
and this piece here will it be another
Valley fold and that will glue together

386
00:10:17,630 --> 00:10:17,640
Valley fold and that will glue together

387
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:21,660
Valley fold and that will glue together
like this is glued together so this one

388
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:21,670
like this is glued together so this one

389
00:10:21,670 --> 00:10:24,360
like this is glued together so this one
of the earliest pop-up mechanisms from

390
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:24,370
of the earliest pop-up mechanisms from

391
00:10:24,370 --> 00:10:27,300
of the earliest pop-up mechanisms from
the very early thirties and I think it's

392
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:27,310
the very early thirties and I think it's

393
00:10:27,310 --> 00:10:29,400
the very early thirties and I think it's
really one of the one of the most fun

394
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:29,410
really one of the one of the most fun

395
00:10:29,410 --> 00:10:31,980
really one of the one of the most fun
and the the one other thing I'd like to

396
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:31,990
and the the one other thing I'd like to

397
00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:33,990
and the the one other thing I'd like to
add actually is when you look at this

398
00:10:33,990 --> 00:10:34,000
add actually is when you look at this

399
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,540
add actually is when you look at this
you see these big ears

400
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:36,550
you see these big ears

401
00:10:36,550 --> 00:10:40,110
you see these big ears
well the ears are coming off these

402
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:40,120
well the ears are coming off these

403
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:43,650

has three different examples of a very

410
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:52,510
has three different examples of a very

411
00:10:52,510 --> 00:10:55,560
has three different examples of a very
early mechanism from the 1930s I don't

412
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:55,570
early mechanism from the 1930s I don't

413
00:10:55,570 --> 00:10:57,180
early mechanism from the 1930s I don't
think you see it in any books these days

414
00:10:57,180 --> 00:10:57,190
think you see it in any books these days

415
00:10:57,190 --> 00:10:59,640
think you see it in any books these days
but it is really good fun and so

00:11:05,050 --> 00:11:08,730
moving the other two are armed so I've
called this tutorial moving arms part
