00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:41,750
so here's an example you use two pieces
他们用来垂直举起一块

5
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:44,830
so here's an example you use two pieces
that are each two 45-degree folds and
蔓延中央脊柱上方

6
00:00:44,830 --> 00:00:44,840
that are each two 45-degree folds and

and in the final spread the pillar that
这个可以粘在脊椎上

34
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:26,930
and in the final spread the pillar that
与脊椎齐平这会来

35
00:01:26,930 --> 00:01:29,289
and in the final spread the pillar that
holds up the throne if you look at it
放在它上面并与它互锁

36
00:01:29,289 --> 00:01:29,299
holds up the throne if you look at it
但是在我们这样做之前，我们需要添加

00:01:31,870 --> 00:01:31,880
underneath here there are two 45-degree
直角的地方非常容易

39
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:34,480
underneath here there are two 45-degree
folds so that's the main use of this
您只需将两个边缘对折即可

40
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:34,490
folds so that's the main use of this
彼此然后一侧折痕

41
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:41,770
folds so that's the main use of this
this mechanism so this is another way of
真的很好，所以这里是折叠一个

42
00:01:41,770 --> 00:01:41,780
this mechanism so this is another way of
45度折叠，然后将

43
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:44,350
this mechanism so this is another way of
making a 45-degree fold this is using
向上压线，那是

44
00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:44,360
making a 45-degree fold this is using

53
00:01:58,460 --> 00:02:01,090
reverse them around this is classic
slots the way you make slot so they're
平衡，所以您可以每种方式放一个

54
00:02:01,090 --> 00:02:01,100
slots the way you make slot so they're
再次确保这些折痕是

55
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:03,160
slots the way you make slot so they're
put together like this and then you cut
真的很好剪掉角落

00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:03,170
put together like this and then you cut
没有任何要塞的要点

57
00:02:03,170 --> 00:02:08,139
put together like this and then you cut
up to the middle two cups about two
您可以将它们都放在

58
00:02:08,139 --> 00:02:08,149
up to the middle two cups about two
同时我把胶水放在两边

59
00:02:08,149 --> 00:02:09,969
up to the middle two cups about two
millimeters apart three millimeters

63
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:20,490
apart
so the two pieces will easily interlock
加冕以确保一切

64


工作舒适，所以有

65
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:23,230
this one can stick down to the spine
这是另一种方式，然后

66
00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:23,240
this one can stick down to the spine
建立了这个，你实际上可以采取

67
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:26,470
this one can stick down to the spine
flush with the spine this one will come
其他的东西，然后坚持下去

70
00:02:30,070 --> 00:02:30,080
down on top of it and interlock with it
想真正做到你可以坚持

71
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,680
down on top of it and interlock with it
but before we do that we need to add the
在这些上，您还得到了两个冲沟

72
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:32,690
but before we do that we need to add the
你可以建立，所以我会

73
00:02:32,690 --> 00:02:36,130
but before we do that we need to add the
45-degree folds so 45-degree fold is
贴上它们，直到关闭

74
00:02:36,130 --> 00:02:36,140
45-degree folds so 45-degree fold is
这是一个封闭的沟壑

75
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:38,050
45-degree folds so 45-degree fold is
very easy where you've got a right angle
是一个即将关闭的沟渠

76
00:02:38,050 --> 00:02:38,060
very easy where you've got a right angle
那些你可以添加反折条

77
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:41,350
very easy where you've got a right angle
you just fold the two edges up against

78
00:02:41,350 --> 00:02:41,360
you just fold the two edges up against
折好一双折痕

79
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:46,300
you just fold the two edges up against
each other then one side crease it
进入它，因此在教程8中我们研究了

80
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:46,310
each other then one side crease it

83
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:53,080
really well so here are folding one
45-degree fold and then you fold the the
由主要机制创建，所以我将

84
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:53,090
45-degree fold and then you fold the the
只是坚持其中之一，然后任何

85
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:55,300
45-degree fold and then you fold the the
crease up against the line so that's
这些已经创建的飞机

86
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:55,310
crease up against the line so that's
你可以继续做那些

87
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:57,400
crease up against the line so that's
dividing the right angle into two
我将确保关闭

88
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:57,410
dividing the right angle into two
好吧，让我们稍微修剪一下

89
00:02:57,410 --> 00:03:03,220
dividing the right angle into two
45-degree folds there it is crease it
在那里，你可以保持
