00:00:33,979 --> 00:00:33,989


3
00:00:33,989 --> 00:00:36,059
I'm going to show you how to make a

4
00:00:36,059 --> 00:00:36,069
I'm going to show you how to make a

5
00:00:36,069 --> 00:00:38,450
I'm going to show you how to make a
Valentine card which in this case is a

6
00:00:38,450 --> 00:00:38,460
Valentine card which in this case is a

7
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:41,639
Valentine card which in this case is a
figure leaping up and the the figure is

8
00:00:41,639 --> 00:00:41,649
figure leaping up and the the figure is

9
00:00:41,649 --> 00:00:43,319
figure leaping up and the the figure is
going to be holding a couple of hearts

10
00:00:43,319 --> 00:00:43,329
going to be holding a couple of hearts

11
00:00:43,329 --> 00:00:45,750
going to be holding a couple of hearts
so this is based on the parallelogram

12
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:45,760
so this is based on the parallelogram

13
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:49,410
so this is based on the parallelogram
which is tutorial five there's a couple

14
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:49,420
which is tutorial five there's a couple

15
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:50,819
which is tutorial five there's a couple
of other examples I've got here I'll

16
00:00:50,819 --> 00:00:50,829
of other examples I've got here I'll

17
00:00:50,829 --> 00:00:53,369
of other examples I've got here I'll
just show you before I start here's

18
00:00:53,369 --> 00:00:53,379
just show you before I start here's

19
00:00:53,379 --> 00:00:55,709
just show you before I start here's
another one holding a ball or something

20
00:00:55,709 --> 00:00:55,719
another one holding a ball or something

21
00:00:55,719 --> 00:00:57,829
another one holding a ball or something
but we're going to make it a heart and

22
00:00:57,829 --> 00:00:57,839
but we're going to make it a heart and

23
00:00:57,839 --> 00:01:00,419
but we're going to make it a heart and
actually you can play with this you can

24
00:01:00,419 --> 00:01:00,429
actually you can play with this you can

25
00:01:00,429 --> 00:01:02,610
actually you can play with this you can
have more than one figure so here's

26
00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:02,620
have more than one figure so here's

27
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:06,480
have more than one figure so here's
another example of two figures it's the

28
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:06,490
another example of two figures it's the

29
00:01:06,490 --> 00:01:08,850
another example of two figures it's the
same basic principle it's still based on

30
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:08,860
same basic principle it's still based on

31
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:11,130
same basic principle it's still based on
the parallelogram I find this quite

32
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:11,140
the parallelogram I find this quite

33
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:14,370
the parallelogram I find this quite
pleasing really start with a base card

34
00:01:14,370 --> 00:01:14,380
pleasing really start with a base card

35
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:18,029
pleasing really start with a base card
here's the base thoroughly creased and

36
00:01:18,029 --> 00:01:18,039
here's the base thoroughly creased and

37
00:01:18,039 --> 00:01:20,760
here's the base thoroughly creased and
then here's another piece we want it to

38
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:20,770
then here's another piece we want it to

39
00:01:20,770 --> 00:01:22,770
then here's another piece we want it to
fit in to blend in with the background

40
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:22,780
fit in to blend in with the background

41
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:25,830
fit in to blend in with the background
I'm just going to make quite a small

42
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:25,840
I'm just going to make quite a small

43
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:28,859
I'm just going to make quite a small
parallelogram like this piece here so

44
00:01:28,859 --> 00:01:28,869
parallelogram like this piece here so

45
00:01:28,869 --> 00:01:33,779
parallelogram like this piece here so
fold in a tab on one end and then we

46
00:01:33,779 --> 00:01:33,789
fold in a tab on one end and then we

47
00:01:33,789 --> 00:01:37,020
fold in a tab on one end and then we
come along something like that put a

48
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:37,030
come along something like that put a

49
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:43,289
come along something like that put a
crease in it and then a short distance

50
00:01:43,289 --> 00:01:43,299
crease in it and then a short distance

51
00:01:43,299 --> 00:01:48,029
crease in it and then a short distance
like that and then we're going to have a

52
00:01:48,029 --> 00:01:48,039
like that and then we're going to have a

53
00:01:48,039 --> 00:01:50,899
like that and then we're going to have a
tab on the other end so this is standard

54
00:01:50,899 --> 00:01:50,909
tab on the other end so this is standard

55
00:01:50,909 --> 00:02:02,670
tab on the other end so this is standard
parallelogram

56
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:02,680


57
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:05,620
right and then just reinforce these

58
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:05,630
right and then just reinforce these

59
00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:10,380
right and then just reinforce these
creases so it all works really well so

60
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:10,390


61
00:02:10,390 --> 00:02:13,150
the key to this one is this is the

62
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:13,160
the key to this one is this is the

63
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:16,030
the key to this one is this is the
parallelogram long side short side when

64
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:16,040
parallelogram long side short side when

65
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:18,040
parallelogram long side short side when
the base is flat the parallelogram is

66
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:18,050
the base is flat the parallelogram is

67
00:02:18,050 --> 00:02:19,600
the base is flat the parallelogram is
flat and there's there are going to have

68
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:19,610
flat and there's there are going to have

69
00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:21,370
flat and there's there are going to have
two little triangles here and here and

70
00:02:21,370 --> 00:02:21,380
two little triangles here and here and

71
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:23,080
two little triangles here and here and
here and here which is what the limbs

72
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:23,090
here and here which is what the limbs

73
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:26,080
here and here which is what the limbs
fit onto so here's the piece with the

74
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:26,090
fit onto so here's the piece with the

75
00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:29,440
fit onto so here's the piece with the
three creases and then it's here we

76
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:29,450
three creases and then it's here we

77
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:35,770
three creases and then it's here we
won't fold it in like that and we'll do

78
00:02:35,770 --> 00:02:35,780
won't fold it in like that and we'll do

79
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:40,479
won't fold it in like that and we'll do
the same on this side as well when we

80
00:02:40,479 --> 00:02:40,489
the same on this side as well when we

81
00:02:40,489 --> 00:02:43,330
the same on this side as well when we
open that up we've got these four little

82
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:43,340
open that up we've got these four little

83
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:46,300
open that up we've got these four little
triangles and so we just make sure

84
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:46,310
triangles and so we just make sure

85
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:49,210
triangles and so we just make sure
that's all really thoroughly priest so

86
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:49,220
that's all really thoroughly priest so

87
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:50,560
that's all really thoroughly priest so
that all moves really

88
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:50,570
that all moves really

89
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:53,110
that all moves really
sweetly when it comes to being stuck

90
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:53,120
sweetly when it comes to being stuck

91
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,960
sweetly when it comes to being stuck
together

92
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:54,970
together

93
00:02:54,970 --> 00:02:58,449
together
now with all parallelograms you have a

94
00:02:58,449 --> 00:02:58,459
now with all parallelograms you have a

95
00:02:58,459 --> 00:03:01,510
now with all parallelograms you have a
long side stuck over a short distance to

96
00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:01,520
long side stuck over a short distance to

97
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:03,310
long side stuck over a short distance to
the spine and you've got a short side

98
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:03,320
the spine and you've got a short side

99
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:05,320
the spine and you've got a short side
which is stuck down a long distance from

100
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:05,330
which is stuck down a long distance from

101
00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:08,650
which is stuck down a long distance from
the spine so I get the pencil and I'll

102
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:08,660
the spine so I get the pencil and I'll

103
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:12,610
the spine so I get the pencil and I'll
just mark the short side here where the

104
00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:12,620
just mark the short side here where the

105
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:16,509
just mark the short side here where the
crease lies so that's there and because

106
00:03:16,509 --> 00:03:16,519
crease lies so that's there and because

107
00:03:16,519 --> 00:03:18,940
crease lies so that's there and because
the whole thing goes flat when the base

108
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:18,950
the whole thing goes flat when the base

109
00:03:18,950 --> 00:03:20,770
the whole thing goes flat when the base
is flat we don't need to measure the

110
00:03:20,770 --> 00:03:20,780
is flat we don't need to measure the

111
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:34,470
is flat we don't need to measure the
other end so I put glue on there

112
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:34,480


113
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,580
that's the long side of the

114
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:36,590
that's the long side of the

115
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:39,580
that's the long side of the
parallelogram stuck down parallel to the

116
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:39,590
parallelogram stuck down parallel to the

117
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:41,589
parallelogram stuck down parallel to the
spine and just a short distance from it

118
00:03:41,589 --> 00:03:41,599
spine and just a short distance from it

119
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:45,880
spine and just a short distance from it
stick this side down so that should go

120
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:45,890
stick this side down so that should go

121
00:03:45,890 --> 00:03:48,940
stick this side down so that should go
flat down just actually do it this way

122
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:48,950
flat down just actually do it this way

123
00:03:48,950 --> 00:03:52,390
flat down just actually do it this way
round so folding it into its closed

124
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:52,400
round so folding it into its closed

125
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:56,530
round so folding it into its closed
position close the base it finds where

126
00:03:56,530 --> 00:03:56,540
position close the base it finds where

127
00:03:56,540 --> 00:04:00,790
position close the base it finds where
it wants to stick and then we open that

128
00:04:00,790 --> 00:04:00,800
it wants to stick and then we open that

129
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:03,309
it wants to stick and then we open that
up and it goes flat when the base is

130
00:04:03,309 --> 00:04:03,319
up and it goes flat when the base is

131
00:04:03,319 --> 00:04:06,090
up and it goes flat when the base is
flat here we have these four little

132
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:06,100
flat here we have these four little

133
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:08,949
flat here we have these four little
triangles and that's where we can stick

134
00:04:08,949 --> 00:04:08,959
triangles and that's where we can stick

135
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:11,440
triangles and that's where we can stick
the limbs on so I'll just make a series

136
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:11,450
the limbs on so I'll just make a series

137
00:04:11,450 --> 00:04:17,409
the limbs on so I'll just make a series
of limbs from this piece these can be

138
00:04:17,409 --> 00:04:17,419
of limbs from this piece these can be

139
00:04:17,419 --> 00:04:20,860
of limbs from this piece these can be
tricky because as it closes they all

140
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:20,870
tricky because as it closes they all

141
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:23,170
tricky because as it closes they all
move in in different directions you

142
00:04:23,170 --> 00:04:23,180
move in in different directions you

143
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:24,700
move in in different directions you
might need to play around and tailor

144
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:24,710
might need to play around and tailor

145
00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:27,310
might need to play around and tailor
these so that as it closes they don't

146
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:27,320
these so that as it closes they don't

147
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:29,350
these so that as it closes they don't
like this hand you can see there's a bit

148
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:29,360
like this hand you can see there's a bit

149
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,640
like this hand you can see there's a bit
of a bend there it looks as though at

150
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:30,650
of a bend there it looks as though at

151
00:04:30,650 --> 00:04:32,469
of a bend there it looks as though at
some points it's snagged against the

152
00:04:32,469 --> 00:04:32,479
some points it's snagged against the

153
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:35,469
some points it's snagged against the
page or the spine as the page is closed

154
00:04:35,469 --> 00:04:35,479
page or the spine as the page is closed

155
00:04:35,479 --> 00:04:37,360
page or the spine as the page is closed
so you might need to play around with

156
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:37,370
so you might need to play around with

157
00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:39,880
so you might need to play around with
these to find the ones that work for you

158
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:39,890
these to find the ones that work for you

159
00:04:39,890 --> 00:04:42,550
these to find the ones that work for you
in this example the limbs are in a

160
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:42,560
in this example the limbs are in a

161
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:45,100
in this example the limbs are in a
different formation so this one as you

162
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:45,110
different formation so this one as you

163
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:47,200
different formation so this one as you
close it you can see the way this leg is

164
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:47,210
close it you can see the way this leg is

165
00:04:47,210 --> 00:04:49,690
close it you can see the way this leg is
going it is in danger of snagging

166
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:49,700
going it is in danger of snagging

167
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:52,779
going it is in danger of snagging
against that page but it's okay and it

168
00:04:52,779 --> 00:04:52,789
against that page but it's okay and it

169
00:04:52,789 --> 00:04:55,990
against that page but it's okay and it
has been worked out nicely so I'll just

170
00:04:55,990 --> 00:04:56,000
has been worked out nicely so I'll just

171
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,830
has been worked out nicely so I'll just
make four four limbs from this so we go

172
00:04:59,830 --> 00:04:59,840
make four four limbs from this so we go

173
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:02,500
make four four limbs from this so we go
with a bent leg I'm just going to make

174
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:02,510
with a bent leg I'm just going to make

175
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:14,549
with a bent leg I'm just going to make
these quite crudely in this case

176
00:05:14,549 --> 00:05:14,559


177
00:05:14,559 --> 00:05:17,170
so here's a leg let's make it a bit

178
00:05:17,170 --> 00:05:17,180
so here's a leg let's make it a bit

179
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:20,409
so here's a leg let's make it a bit
shorter and we can stick that on like

180
00:05:20,409 --> 00:05:20,419
shorter and we can stick that on like

181
00:05:20,419 --> 00:05:22,600
shorter and we can stick that on like
this now I just put some glue on this

182
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:22,610
this now I just put some glue on this

183
00:05:22,610 --> 00:05:27,760
this now I just put some glue on this
triangle stick the leg in and I would

184
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:27,770
triangle stick the leg in and I would

185
00:05:27,770 --> 00:05:29,950
triangle stick the leg in and I would
just check that that does actually work

186
00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:29,960
just check that that does actually work

187
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:32,799
just check that that does actually work
as the page closes that one's swinging

188
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:32,809
as the page closes that one's swinging

189
00:05:32,809 --> 00:05:36,610
as the page closes that one's swinging
around against the page so that one

190
00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:36,620
around against the page so that one

191
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:41,049
around against the page so that one
seems okay but try another one if this

192
00:05:41,049 --> 00:05:41,059
seems okay but try another one if this

193
00:05:41,059 --> 00:05:45,010
seems okay but try another one if this
was just stuck on straight on to here I

194
00:05:45,010 --> 00:05:45,020
was just stuck on straight on to here I

195
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:47,050
was just stuck on straight on to here I
think we might have some trouble so I'm

196
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:47,060
think we might have some trouble so I'm

197
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:49,540
think we might have some trouble so I'm
going to change the shape at the top of

198
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:49,550
going to change the shape at the top of

199
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:51,610
going to change the shape at the top of
the leg so that you can bring this down

200
00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:51,620
the leg so that you can bring this down

201
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:57,059
the leg so that you can bring this down
so I'll tape that that corner off there

202
00:05:57,059 --> 00:05:57,069


203
00:05:57,069 --> 00:06:00,129
and now I'll put some glue on there and

204
00:06:00,129 --> 00:06:00,139
and now I'll put some glue on there and

205
00:06:00,139 --> 00:06:10,510
and now I'll put some glue on there and
try this one out so as you can see this

206
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:10,520
try this one out so as you can see this

207
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:13,689
try this one out so as you can see this
it's not actually doing what I want so

208
00:06:13,689 --> 00:06:13,699
it's not actually doing what I want so

209
00:06:13,699 --> 00:06:15,519
it's not actually doing what I want so
we're gonna have to change this take it

210
00:06:15,519 --> 00:06:15,529
we're gonna have to change this take it

211
00:06:15,529 --> 00:06:23,290
we're gonna have to change this take it
off and start so this was the leg that

212
00:06:23,290 --> 00:06:23,300
off and start so this was the leg that

213
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:27,129
off and start so this was the leg that
didn't work that was like that like that

214
00:06:27,129 --> 00:06:27,139
didn't work that was like that like that

215
00:06:27,139 --> 00:06:29,230
didn't work that was like that like that
and that one didn't work so let's just

216
00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:29,240
and that one didn't work so let's just

217
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:31,360
and that one didn't work so let's just
have a look at these I've adjusted this

218
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:31,370
have a look at these I've adjusted this

219
00:06:31,370 --> 00:06:33,550
have a look at these I've adjusted this
a little bit more put a bit more glue

220
00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:33,560
a little bit more put a bit more glue

221
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:37,889
a little bit more put a bit more glue
back on there try it again

222
00:06:37,889 --> 00:06:37,899
back on there try it again

223
00:06:37,899 --> 00:06:40,029
back on there try it again
that's right coming out at this angle

224
00:06:40,029 --> 00:06:40,039
that's right coming out at this angle

225
00:06:40,039 --> 00:06:49,600
that's right coming out at this angle
this time close to page yeah okay so

226
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:49,610
this time close to page yeah okay so

227
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:52,689
this time close to page yeah okay so
that's four legs working now we want a

228
00:06:52,689 --> 00:06:52,699
that's four legs working now we want a

229
00:06:52,699 --> 00:06:55,809
that's four legs working now we want a
couple of arms let's come up to

230
00:06:55,809 --> 00:06:55,819
couple of arms let's come up to

231
00:06:55,819 --> 00:07:00,610
couple of arms let's come up to
something like this we don't really need

232
00:07:00,610 --> 00:07:00,620
something like this we don't really need

233
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:02,110
something like this we don't really need
to worry about the hands too much

234
00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:02,120
to worry about the hands too much

235
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:04,029
to worry about the hands too much
because it's gonna be holding some

236
00:07:04,029 --> 00:07:04,039
because it's gonna be holding some

237
00:07:04,039 --> 00:07:32,159
because it's gonna be holding some
hearts so that's just

238
00:07:32,159 --> 00:07:32,169


239
00:07:32,169 --> 00:07:34,570
if you look at these and they're stuck

240
00:07:34,570 --> 00:07:34,580
if you look at these and they're stuck

241
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:36,219
if you look at these and they're stuck
on the small side the piece is actually

242
00:07:36,219 --> 00:07:36,229
on the small side the piece is actually

243
00:07:36,229 --> 00:07:38,860
on the small side the piece is actually
rotate against the page so there's very

244
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:38,870
rotate against the page so there's very

245
00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:40,330
rotate against the page so there's very
little chance of there actually being a

246
00:07:40,330 --> 00:07:40,340
little chance of there actually being a

247
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:41,140
little chance of there actually being a
problem there

248
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:41,150
problem there

249
00:07:41,150 --> 00:07:43,420
problem there
it's these ones stuck on to these two

250
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:43,430
it's these ones stuck on to these two

251
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:45,459
it's these ones stuck on to these two
triangles that are on the long side as

252
00:07:45,459 --> 00:07:45,469
triangles that are on the long side as

253
00:07:45,469 --> 00:07:48,519
triangles that are on the long side as
the page closes they actually flip over

254
00:07:48,519 --> 00:07:48,529
the page closes they actually flip over

255
00:07:48,529 --> 00:07:51,040
the page closes they actually flip over
that's where the problems start arising

256
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:51,050
that's where the problems start arising

257
00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:54,249
that's where the problems start arising
we've got that limb okay and now we'll

258
00:07:54,249 --> 00:07:54,259
we've got that limb okay and now we'll

259
00:07:54,259 --> 00:07:57,670
we've got that limb okay and now we'll
just do one more I'll try making it come

260
00:07:57,670 --> 00:07:57,680
just do one more I'll try making it come

261
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:00,279
just do one more I'll try making it come
up it's a bit of an angle like this I

262
00:08:00,279 --> 00:08:00,289
up it's a bit of an angle like this I

263
00:08:00,289 --> 00:08:03,879
up it's a bit of an angle like this I
think judging by that that seems to be

264
00:08:03,879 --> 00:08:03,889
think judging by that that seems to be

265
00:08:03,889 --> 00:08:27,970
think judging by that that seems to be
okay and this one

266
00:08:27,970 --> 00:08:27,980


267
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:29,690
something like that

268
00:08:29,690 --> 00:08:29,700
something like that

269
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:44,440
something like that
maybe I'll just just give it a try

270
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:44,450


271
00:08:44,450 --> 00:09:01,340
close it down that's looking good just

272
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:01,350
close it down that's looking good just

273
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:05,180
close it down that's looking good just
about it's slightly not quite happy but

274
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:05,190
about it's slightly not quite happy but

275
00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:09,080
about it's slightly not quite happy but
not too bad and then we need a head so

276
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:09,090
not too bad and then we need a head so

277
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:12,590
not too bad and then we need a head so
I'll just do something really basic for

278
00:09:12,590 --> 00:09:12,600
I'll just do something really basic for

279
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:53,329
I'll just do something really basic for
that this time no I'm gonna change it

280
00:09:53,329 --> 00:09:53,339
that this time no I'm gonna change it

281
00:09:53,339 --> 00:09:55,550
that this time no I'm gonna change it
and put it on this side because we know

282
00:09:55,550 --> 00:09:55,560
and put it on this side because we know

283
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:58,700
and put it on this side because we know
this this side is safe it rotates that

284
00:09:58,700 --> 00:09:58,710
this this side is safe it rotates that

285
00:09:58,710 --> 00:10:02,090
this this side is safe it rotates that
way rather than flipping over so we know

286
00:10:02,090 --> 00:10:02,100
way rather than flipping over so we know

287
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:04,970
way rather than flipping over so we know
that stuck on that side the head will be

288
00:10:04,970 --> 00:10:04,980
that stuck on that side the head will be

289
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:08,420
that stuck on that side the head will be
okay in fact when you come to making

290
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:08,430
okay in fact when you come to making

291
00:10:08,430 --> 00:10:10,040
okay in fact when you come to making
your own design you'd probably make all

292
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:10,050
your own design you'd probably make all

293
00:10:10,050 --> 00:10:12,200
your own design you'd probably make all
these out of one piece so the two arms

294
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:12,210
these out of one piece so the two arms

295
00:10:12,210 --> 00:10:14,150
these out of one piece so the two arms
would be one piece of just a crease down

296
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:14,160
would be one piece of just a crease down

297
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,010
would be one piece of just a crease down
the middle yeah you can see that's what

298
00:10:16,010 --> 00:10:16,020
the middle yeah you can see that's what

299
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:18,260
the middle yeah you can see that's what
I've done in this case the arms are one

300
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:18,270
I've done in this case the arms are one

301
00:10:18,270 --> 00:10:20,450
I've done in this case the arms are one
piece of the crease and the legs are one

302
00:10:20,450 --> 00:10:20,460
piece of the crease and the legs are one

303
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:22,820
piece of the crease and the legs are one
piece of the crease but to do this I had

304
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:22,830
piece of the crease but to do this I had

305
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:25,840
piece of the crease but to do this I had
to go through a number of dummy ruts

306
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:25,850
to go through a number of dummy ruts

307
00:10:25,850 --> 00:10:28,400
to go through a number of dummy ruts
attempt till I got the angles all right

308
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:28,410
attempt till I got the angles all right

309
00:10:28,410 --> 00:10:32,960
attempt till I got the angles all right
and then now this is working okay so now

310
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:32,970
and then now this is working okay so now

311
00:10:32,970 --> 00:10:35,829
and then now this is working okay so now
we can just add the hearts so this one

312
00:10:35,829 --> 00:10:35,839
we can just add the hearts so this one

313
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:39,260
we can just add the hearts so this one
doesn't really matter where the heart is

314
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:39,270
doesn't really matter where the heart is

315
00:10:39,270 --> 00:10:41,420
doesn't really matter where the heart is
because we know it'll move safely

316
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:41,430
because we know it'll move safely

317
00:10:41,430 --> 00:10:46,000
because we know it'll move safely
there's one on there that's working okay

318
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:46,010
there's one on there that's working okay

319
00:10:46,010 --> 00:10:47,930
there's one on there that's working okay
you've got to be careful here because

320
00:10:47,930 --> 00:10:47,940
you've got to be careful here because

321
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:49,760
you've got to be careful here because
we've got to look at where is it tending

322
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:49,770
we've got to look at where is it tending

323
00:10:49,770 --> 00:10:51,710
we've got to look at where is it tending
to snag and you can see it's tending to

324
00:10:51,710 --> 00:10:51,720
to snag and you can see it's tending to

325
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:54,020
to snag and you can see it's tending to
snag at this bottom bit whereas the top

326
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:54,030
snag at this bottom bit whereas the top

327
