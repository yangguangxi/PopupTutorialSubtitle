00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:37,900
this tutorial is back flaps so here we

2
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:37,910
this tutorial is back flaps so here we

3
00:00:37,910 --> 00:00:40,390
this tutorial is back flaps so here we
are there's two kinds this kind as you

4
00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:40,400
are there's two kinds this kind as you

5
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:43,090
are there's two kinds this kind as you
pull the tab tip pulls in the direction

6
00:00:43,090 --> 00:00:43,100
pull the tab tip pulls in the direction

7
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:45,720
pull the tab tip pulls in the direction
of the pole it's a very very easy

8
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:45,730
of the pole it's a very very easy

9
00:00:45,730 --> 00:00:48,400
of the pole it's a very very easy
structure and this type is more

10
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:48,410
structure and this type is more

11
00:00:48,410 --> 00:00:50,229
structure and this type is more
interesting as you pull the tab it moves

12
00:00:50,229 --> 00:00:50,239
interesting as you pull the tab it moves

13
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:56,850
interesting as you pull the tab it moves
in the opposite direction to the pole

14
00:00:56,850 --> 00:00:56,860


15
00:00:56,860 --> 00:00:59,709
I'll just start by making a couple the

16
00:00:59,709 --> 00:00:59,719
I'll just start by making a couple the

17
00:00:59,719 --> 00:01:03,430
I'll just start by making a couple the
first one here it is the pull strip the

18
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:03,440
first one here it is the pull strip the

19
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:05,590
first one here it is the pull strip the
basic pull strip is explained in

20
00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:05,600
basic pull strip is explained in

21
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:09,520
basic pull strip is explained in
tutorial 25 and so all pull strips must

22
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:09,530
tutorial 25 and so all pull strips must

23
00:01:09,530 --> 00:01:11,469
tutorial 25 and so all pull strips must
be double thickness they also need

24
00:01:11,469 --> 00:01:11,479
be double thickness they also need

25
00:01:11,479 --> 00:01:13,360
be double thickness they also need
measuring so I've done all the measuring

26
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:13,370
measuring so I've done all the measuring

27
00:01:13,370 --> 00:01:15,190
measuring so I've done all the measuring
and prepared these pieces beforehand

28
00:01:15,190 --> 00:01:15,200
and prepared these pieces beforehand

29
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,590
and prepared these pieces beforehand
just to make it quicker so this is the

30
00:01:17,590 --> 00:01:17,600
just to make it quicker so this is the

31
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,359
just to make it quicker so this is the
pool strip it's been scored down the

32
00:01:19,359 --> 00:01:19,369
pool strip it's been scored down the

33
00:01:19,369 --> 00:01:22,260
pool strip it's been scored down the
middle folded and then always glue it

34
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:22,270
middle folded and then always glue it

35
00:01:22,270 --> 00:01:24,370
middle folded and then always glue it
when it's going to fold in it and it's

36
00:01:24,370 --> 00:01:24,380
when it's going to fold in it and it's

37
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:25,420
when it's going to fold in it and it's
glued it just makes the whole thing

38
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:25,430
glued it just makes the whole thing

39
00:01:25,430 --> 00:01:28,390
glued it just makes the whole thing
stronger so you can push it pull it no

40
00:01:28,390 --> 00:01:28,400
stronger so you can push it pull it no

41
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:34,929
stronger so you can push it pull it no
buckling and this one the pull strip is

42
00:01:34,929 --> 00:01:34,939
buckling and this one the pull strip is

43
00:01:34,939 --> 00:01:37,179
buckling and this one the pull strip is
double thickness and then at the end one

44
00:01:37,179 --> 00:01:37,189
double thickness and then at the end one

45
00:01:37,189 --> 00:01:39,160
double thickness and then at the end one
thickness you just have this little tab

46
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:39,170
thickness you just have this little tab

47
00:01:39,170 --> 00:01:40,780
thickness you just have this little tab
which is what's going to stick onto the

48
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:40,790
which is what's going to stick onto the

49
00:01:40,790 --> 00:01:45,340
which is what's going to stick onto the
flap and lift it up this is the flap I

50
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:45,350
flap and lift it up this is the flap I

51
00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:48,310
flap and lift it up this is the flap I
prepared the flap has a tab on the

52
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:48,320
prepared the flap has a tab on the

53
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:50,380
prepared the flap has a tab on the
bottom that that will stick to the page

54
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:50,390
bottom that that will stick to the page

55
00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:52,749
bottom that that will stick to the page
and the place I've measured it to be put

56
00:01:52,749 --> 00:01:52,759
and the place I've measured it to be put

57
00:01:52,759 --> 00:01:56,530
and the place I've measured it to be put
the glue on the tab and glue it to the

58
00:01:56,530 --> 00:01:56,540
the glue on the tab and glue it to the

59
00:01:56,540 --> 00:02:01,859
the glue on the tab and glue it to the
page the pull strip is going to stick on

60
00:02:01,859 --> 00:02:01,869
page the pull strip is going to stick on

61
00:02:01,869 --> 00:02:06,609
page the pull strip is going to stick on
here and go through these two slits in

62
00:02:06,609 --> 00:02:06,619
here and go through these two slits in

63
00:02:06,619 --> 00:02:09,609
here and go through these two slits in
the page the slits need to be cut so

64
00:02:09,609 --> 00:02:09,619
the page the slits need to be cut so

65
00:02:09,619 --> 00:02:12,160
the page the slits need to be cut so
they go back a bit this end they only

66
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:12,170
they go back a bit this end they only

67
00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:12,980
they go back a bit this end they only
need to go back

68
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:12,990
need to go back

69
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:14,900
need to go back
couple of meals that the car just lifts

70
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:14,910
couple of meals that the car just lifts

71
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:17,150
couple of meals that the car just lifts
up and very little bit but this but it

72
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:17,160
up and very little bit but this but it

73
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:19,130
up and very little bit but this but it
needs to be cut back about a centimeter

74
00:02:19,130 --> 00:02:19,140
needs to be cut back about a centimeter

75
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:21,860
needs to be cut back about a centimeter
so it can lift up more so you just feed

76
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:21,870
so it can lift up more so you just feed

77
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:25,760
so it can lift up more so you just feed
it through feed it through this side as

78
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:25,770
it through feed it through this side as

79
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:32,690
it through feed it through this side as
well and then we can stick the tab on

80
00:02:32,690 --> 00:02:32,700
well and then we can stick the tab on

81
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:34,490
well and then we can stick the tab on
top but I think it's just nature it goes

82
00:02:34,490 --> 00:02:34,500
top but I think it's just nature it goes

83
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:37,610
top but I think it's just nature it goes
underneath so it's hidden from you put

84
00:02:37,610 --> 00:02:37,620
underneath so it's hidden from you put

85
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:47,680
underneath so it's hidden from you put
some glue on that one and stick it down

86
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:47,690


87
00:02:47,690 --> 00:02:53,030
let it go off and yep there you go see

88
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:53,040
let it go off and yep there you go see

89
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:56,060
let it go off and yep there you go see
it's lifting the flow there is another

90
00:02:56,060 --> 00:02:56,070
it's lifting the flow there is another

91
00:02:56,070 --> 00:02:58,400
it's lifting the flow there is another
way of doing this where the strip goes

92
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:58,410
way of doing this where the strip goes

93
00:02:58,410 --> 00:03:00,890
way of doing this where the strip goes
through the flap and there's a good

94
00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:00,900
through the flap and there's a good

95
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:03,470
through the flap and there's a good
example in this Robert crafters book the

96
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:03,480
example in this Robert crafters book the

97
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:05,900
example in this Robert crafters book the
most amazing hide-and-seek counting book

98
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:05,910
most amazing hide-and-seek counting book

99
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:09,050
most amazing hide-and-seek counting book
and if we open it up this is one we're

100
00:03:09,050 --> 00:03:09,060
and if we open it up this is one we're

101
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:12,140
and if we open it up this is one we're
looking at as you pull it it lifts up

102
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:12,150
looking at as you pull it it lifts up

103
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:13,850
looking at as you pull it it lifts up
the flap and it's actually got another

104
00:03:13,850 --> 00:03:13,860
the flap and it's actually got another

105
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:16,100
the flap and it's actually got another
flap underneath so you can see this has

106
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:16,110
flap underneath so you can see this has

107
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:17,900
flap underneath so you can see this has
been pushed through there's a slot in

108
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:17,910
been pushed through there's a slot in

109
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:19,790
been pushed through there's a slot in
the flap here again the slope will be

110
00:03:19,790 --> 00:03:19,800
the flap here again the slope will be

111
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:22,790
the flap here again the slope will be
about two millimeters wide and to

112
00:03:22,790 --> 00:03:22,800
about two millimeters wide and to

113
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,190
about two millimeters wide and to
construct this there are creases here

114
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:25,200
construct this there are creases here

115
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,870
construct this there are creases here
and here so these two bits have been

116
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:26,880
and here so these two bits have been

117
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:30,260
and here so these two bits have been
folded up and pushed through the slot in

118
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:30,270
folded up and pushed through the slot in

119
00:03:30,270 --> 00:03:32,870
folded up and pushed through the slot in
the main flap and then unfolded again

120
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:32,880
the main flap and then unfolded again

121
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:35,120
the main flap and then unfolded again
and then this end is pushed through that

122
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:35,130
and then this end is pushed through that

123
00:03:35,130 --> 00:03:38,330
and then this end is pushed through that
page so that's just another variation of

124
00:03:38,330 --> 00:03:38,340
page so that's just another variation of

125
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:43,630
page so that's just another variation of
this type

126
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:43,640


127
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:46,460
the other kind which is more interesting

128
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:46,470
the other kind which is more interesting

129
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:49,399
the other kind which is more interesting
really is this type which lifts up away

130
00:03:49,399 --> 00:03:49,409
really is this type which lifts up away

131
00:03:49,409 --> 00:03:51,110
really is this type which lifts up away
from the direction of the pool and it's

132
00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:51,120
from the direction of the pool and it's

133
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,539
from the direction of the pool and it's
based on earth I guess the slotting the

134
00:03:53,539 --> 00:03:53,549
based on earth I guess the slotting the

135
00:03:53,549 --> 00:03:55,580
based on earth I guess the slotting the
pages of fulcrum I've got a bigger one

136
00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:55,590
pages of fulcrum I've got a bigger one

137
00:03:55,590 --> 00:03:59,800
pages of fulcrum I've got a bigger one
here so you can see it much more clearly

138
00:03:59,800 --> 00:03:59,810
here so you can see it much more clearly

139
00:03:59,810 --> 00:04:03,500
here so you can see it much more clearly
the strip has these two little tabs on

140
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:03,510
the strip has these two little tabs on

141
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:05,960
the strip has these two little tabs on
each side and they fold up while you

142
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:05,970
each side and they fold up while you

143
00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:07,819
each side and they fold up while you
push the whole thing through this slot

144
00:04:07,819 --> 00:04:07,829
push the whole thing through this slot

145
00:04:07,829 --> 00:04:10,039
push the whole thing through this slot
then you unfold them and they keep the

146
00:04:10,039 --> 00:04:10,049
then you unfold them and they keep the

147
00:04:10,049 --> 00:04:11,449
then you unfold them and they keep the
whole thing in position

148
00:04:11,449 --> 00:04:11,459
whole thing in position

149
00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:14,360
whole thing in position
here's the one I prepared this is the

150
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:14,370
here's the one I prepared this is the

151
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:15,920
here's the one I prepared this is the
pull strip double-thickness

152
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:15,930
pull strip double-thickness

153
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:26,360
pull strip double-thickness
so I'll just glue that so that's the

154
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:26,370
so I'll just glue that so that's the

155
00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:28,310
so I'll just glue that so that's the
double thickness pull strip and now here

156
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:28,320
double thickness pull strip and now here

157
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,800
double thickness pull strip and now here
these are the two little tabs which will

158
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:30,810
these are the two little tabs which will

159
00:04:30,810 --> 00:04:33,260
these are the two little tabs which will
fold down as you can strut the whole

160
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:33,270
fold down as you can strut the whole

161
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:38,000
fold down as you can strut the whole
piece this is a another fold here which

162
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:38,010
piece this is a another fold here which

163
00:04:38,010 --> 00:04:41,659
piece this is a another fold here which
is what makes the whole thing work the

164
00:04:41,659 --> 00:04:41,669
is what makes the whole thing work the

165
00:04:41,669 --> 00:04:45,140
is what makes the whole thing work the
important thing is to between this point

166
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:45,150
important thing is to between this point

167
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:47,180
important thing is to between this point
between the little tabs and the main

168
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:47,190
between the little tabs and the main

169
00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:50,210
between the little tabs and the main
flap this point and this point where the

170
00:04:50,210 --> 00:04:50,220
flap this point and this point where the

171
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:52,310
flap this point and this point where the
crease is that's about seven mil that's

172
00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:52,320
crease is that's about seven mil that's

173
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:55,159
crease is that's about seven mil that's
fairly crucial you have the main flap

174
00:04:55,159 --> 00:04:55,169
fairly crucial you have the main flap

175
00:04:55,169 --> 00:04:57,260
fairly crucial you have the main flap
and then you have these two little tabs

176
00:04:57,260 --> 00:04:57,270
and then you have these two little tabs

177
00:04:57,270 --> 00:04:59,740
and then you have these two little tabs
which fold up and go through the

178
00:04:59,740 --> 00:04:59,750
which fold up and go through the

and the rest of the strip goes through

183
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:08,990
and the rest of the strip goes through
this slit here you fold them down this

just a really simple example of how you

297
00:07:47,330 --> 00:07:49,960
just a really simple example of how you
can get the two flaps working together

298
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:49,970
can get the two flaps working together

299
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:52,960

00:07:55,090 --> 00:07:55,100
strip is double you can see it all

303
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:59,650
strip is double you can see it all
pretty clearly though this is where

304
00:07:59,650 --> 00:07:59,660
pretty clearly though this is where

305
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:01,750
pretty clearly though this is where
you've got the flap moving away from the

306
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:01,760
you've got the flap moving away from the

307
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:03,490
you've got the flap moving away from the
direction of the pool but in this case

308
00:08:03,490 --> 00:08:03,500
direction of the pool but in this case

00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:31,860
moving that makes it stop when it's in
the vertical position this is delayed

328
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:31,870
the vertical position this is delayed

329
00:08:31,870 --> 00:08:33,510
the vertical position this is delayed
double action so it's a bit more

330
00:08:33,510 --> 00:08:33,520
double action so it's a bit more

331
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:35,580
double action so it's a bit more
complicated as you pull the strip first

332
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:35,590
complicated as you pull the strip first

333
00:08:35,590 --> 00:08:39,150
complicated as you pull the strip first
one flap lifts and then the other one so

334
00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:39,160
one flap lifts and then the other one so

335
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:42,180
one flap lifts and then the other one so
the way this works this flap is actually

336
00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:42,190
the way this works this flap is actually

337
00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:44,520
the way this works this flap is actually
a pocket it's not just one piece of card

338
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:44,530
a pocket it's not just one piece of card

339
00:08:44,530 --> 00:08:47,250
a pocket it's not just one piece of card
it's actually hollow inside and so when

340
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:47,260
it's actually hollow inside and so when

341
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:49,680
it's actually hollow inside and so when
you look at it this way around you can

342
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:49,690
you look at it this way around you can

343
00:08:49,690 --> 00:08:52,440
you look at it this way around you can
see the end of the pull strip actually

344
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:52,450
see the end of the pull strip actually

345
00:08:52,450 --> 00:08:54,480
see the end of the pull strip actually
goes up inside the pocket so as you pull

346
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:54,490
goes up inside the pocket so as you pull

347
00:08:54,490 --> 00:08:58,350
goes up inside the pocket so as you pull
it it comes that it lifts it up and then

348
00:08:58,350 --> 00:08:58,360
it it comes that it lifts it up and then

349
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:01,440
it it comes that it lifts it up and then
slides back the second flap is moved by

350
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:01,450
slides back the second flap is moved by

351
00:09:01,450 --> 00:09:03,570
slides back the second flap is moved by
this piece and these come through this

352
00:09:03,570 --> 00:09:03,580
this piece and these come through this

353
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:06,030
this piece and these come through this
window in the page so as you pull it it

354
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:06,040
window in the page so as you pull it it

355
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:07,950
window in the page so as you pull it it
doesn't engage initially it has to go

356
00:09:07,950 --> 00:09:07,960
doesn't engage initially it has to go

357
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:08,820
doesn't engage initially it has to go
that far

358
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:08,830
that far

359
00:09:08,830 --> 00:09:11,190
that far
then it engages and can lift the second

360
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:11,200
then it engages and can lift the second

361
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:14,580
then it engages and can lift the second
flap and so the key thing here is the

362
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:14,590
flap and so the key thing here is the

363
00:09:14,590 --> 00:09:18,450
flap and so the key thing here is the
distance between you look both the flaps

364
00:09:18,450 --> 00:09:18,460
distance between you look both the flaps

365
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:20,900
distance between you look both the flaps
are working through a slot in the page

366
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:20,910
are working through a slot in the page

367
00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:24,120
are working through a slot in the page
so here you see the two slots in the

368
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:24,130
so here you see the two slots in the

369
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:27,210
so here you see the two slots in the
page the distance between them is the

370
00:09:27,210 --> 00:09:27,220
page the distance between them is the

371
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:29,130
page the distance between them is the
same as the distance between this crease

372
00:09:29,130 --> 00:09:29,140
same as the distance between this crease

373
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:31,800
same as the distance between this crease
and this point in the window in the

374
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:31,810
and this point in the window in the

375
00:09:31,810 --> 00:09:35,040
and this point in the window in the
slide where it engages so that's the

376
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:35,050
slide where it engages so that's the

377
00:09:35,050 --> 00:09:38,160
slide where it engages so that's the
crucial thing with this one and I can

378
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:38,170
crucial thing with this one and I can

379
00:09:38,170 --> 00:09:39,870
crucial thing with this one and I can
show you a really nice example of that

380
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:39,880
show you a really nice example of that

381
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:43,890
show you a really nice example of that
