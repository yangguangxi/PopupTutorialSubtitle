this card is a birthday card containing

4
00:00:37,390 --> 00:00:37,400
this card is a birthday card containing

5
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:39,460
this card is a birthday card containing
a boat and in this case I've done the

6
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:39,470
a boat and in this case I've done the

7
00:00:39,470 --> 00:00:41,860
a boat and in this case I've done the
Owl and the Pussycat it's quite a simple

8
00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:41,870
Owl and the Pussycat it's quite a simple

9
00:00:41,870 --> 00:00:44,530
Owl and the Pussycat it's quite a simple
mechanism it's based on tutorial 14

10
00:00:44,530 --> 00:00:44,540
mechanism it's based on tutorial 14

11
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:47,889
mechanism it's based on tutorial 14
which is the box is an example of the

12
00:00:47,889 --> 00:00:47,899
which is the box is an example of the

13
00:00:47,899 --> 00:00:50,550
which is the box is an example of the
box as you can see it's two

14
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:50,560
box as you can see it's two

15
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:53,770
box as you can see it's two
parallelograms back-to-back and it's the

16
00:00:53,770 --> 00:00:53,780
parallelograms back-to-back and it's the

17
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:55,810
parallelograms back-to-back and it's the
piece on the end that makes it into a

18
00:00:55,810 --> 00:00:55,820
piece on the end that makes it into a

19
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:58,990
piece on the end that makes it into a
rigid shape and in this case rather than

20
00:00:58,990 --> 00:00:59,000
rigid shape and in this case rather than

21
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,580
rigid shape and in this case rather than
it being just a flat piece that goes

22
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:00,590
it being just a flat piece that goes

23
00:01:00,590 --> 00:01:03,370
it being just a flat piece that goes
across the end of the box we've got the

24
00:01:03,370 --> 00:01:03,380
across the end of the box we've got the

25
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:06,190
across the end of the box we've got the
boat shape this goes across the end of

26
00:01:06,190 --> 00:01:06,200
boat shape this goes across the end of

27
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:08,100
boat shape this goes across the end of
the box and holds the whole thing rigid

28
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:08,110
the box and holds the whole thing rigid

29
00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:12,219
the box and holds the whole thing rigid
the parts you need to make this these

30
00:01:12,219 --> 00:01:12,229
the parts you need to make this these

31
00:01:12,229 --> 00:01:13,899
the parts you need to make this these
are the parts I've already cut them out

32
00:01:13,899 --> 00:01:13,909
are the parts I've already cut them out

33
00:01:13,909 --> 00:01:17,109
are the parts I've already cut them out
and measured them these are the two bits

34
00:01:17,109 --> 00:01:17,119
and measured them these are the two bits

35
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:19,230
and measured them these are the two bits
which will turn into the parallelograms

36
00:01:19,230 --> 00:01:19,240
which will turn into the parallelograms

37
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:23,980
which will turn into the parallelograms
it's three sections 2,5 centimeters 2,5

38
00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:23,990
it's three sections 2,5 centimeters 2,5

39
00:01:23,990 --> 00:01:28,030
it's three sections 2,5 centimeters 2,5
2,5 with a tab at each end and both of

40
00:01:28,030 --> 00:01:28,040
2,5 with a tab at each end and both of

41
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:31,390
2,5 with a tab at each end and both of
them they're just 5 centimetres wide and

42
00:01:31,390 --> 00:01:31,400
them they're just 5 centimetres wide and

43
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:32,789
them they're just 5 centimetres wide and
then these are the sides of the boat

44
00:01:32,789 --> 00:01:32,799
then these are the sides of the boat

45
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:36,160
then these are the sides of the boat
from crease to crease it's 16

46
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:36,170
from crease to crease it's 16

47
00:01:36,170 --> 00:01:39,219
from crease to crease it's 16
centimetres you've got two tabs on the

48
00:01:39,219 --> 00:01:39,229
centimetres you've got two tabs on the

49
00:01:39,229 --> 00:01:41,170
centimetres you've got two tabs on the
end of one of the pieces and the other

50
00:01:41,170 --> 00:01:41,180
end of one of the pieces and the other

51
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:43,149
end of one of the pieces and the other
piece doesn't need tabs so from the

52
00:01:43,149 --> 00:01:43,159
piece doesn't need tabs so from the

53
00:01:43,159 --> 00:01:45,219
piece doesn't need tabs so from the
cottage to the cottage that 16

54
00:01:45,219 --> 00:01:45,229
cottage to the cottage that 16

55
00:01:45,229 --> 00:01:47,499
cottage to the cottage that 16
centimetres and the final piece this is

56
00:01:47,499 --> 00:01:47,509
centimetres and the final piece this is

57
00:01:47,509 --> 00:01:49,810
centimetres and the final piece this is
the mast so now I'll just show you how

58
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:49,820
the mast so now I'll just show you how

59
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:52,390
the mast so now I'll just show you how
to stick them all together first of all

60
00:01:52,390 --> 00:01:52,400
to stick them all together first of all

61
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:55,480
to stick them all together first of all
make sure all the creases are really

62
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:55,490
make sure all the creases are really

63
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:59,560
make sure all the creases are really
well enforced so I'll just crease all

64
00:01:59,560 --> 00:01:59,570
well enforced so I'll just crease all

65
00:01:59,570 --> 00:02:03,860
well enforced so I'll just crease all
those

66
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:03,870


67
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:06,450
when you're making these you don't need

68
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:06,460
when you're making these you don't need

69
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:08,580
when you're making these you don't need
to measure where the pieces go on the

70
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:08,590
to measure where the pieces go on the

71
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:11,810
to measure where the pieces go on the
base so I'll just start with one you

72
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:11,820
base so I'll just start with one you

73
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:16,020
base so I'll just start with one you
glue one of the tabs flush with the

74
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:16,030
glue one of the tabs flush with the

75
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:19,080
glue one of the tabs flush with the
spine make sure the glue goes right up

76
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:19,090
spine make sure the glue goes right up

77
00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:22,470
spine make sure the glue goes right up
to the crease and you stick that in the

78
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:22,480
to the crease and you stick that in the

79
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:29,100
to the crease and you stick that in the
middle flush with the spine and then to

80
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:29,110
middle flush with the spine and then to

81
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:32,550
middle flush with the spine and then to
find its natural sticking place you fold

82
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:32,560
find its natural sticking place you fold

83
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,380
find its natural sticking place you fold
the whole thing into its what's going to

84
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:34,390
the whole thing into its what's going to

85
00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:37,040
the whole thing into its what's going to
be its closed position

86
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:37,050
be its closed position

87
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:50,010
be its closed position
put glue on that other tab and then fold

88
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:50,020
put glue on that other tab and then fold

89
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:55,800
put glue on that other tab and then fold
the base closed so that gives you your

90
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:55,810
the base closed so that gives you your

91
00:02:55,810 --> 00:02:59,490
the base closed so that gives you your
first parallelogram the next one again

92
00:02:59,490 --> 00:02:59,500
first parallelogram the next one again

93
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:05,010
first parallelogram the next one again
you stick it one side flush with the

94
00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:05,020
you stick it one side flush with the

95
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:12,600
you stick it one side flush with the
spine

96
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:12,610


97
00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:15,600
fold it into its closed position and put

98
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:15,610
fold it into its closed position and put

99
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:24,270
fold it into its closed position and put
glue on the other tab and then you fold

100
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:24,280
glue on the other tab and then you fold

101
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:30,870
glue on the other tab and then you fold
the base closed so these are your two

102
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:30,880
the base closed so these are your two

103
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:33,330
the base closed so these are your two
parallelograms now is your chance to

104
00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:33,340
parallelograms now is your chance to

105
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:35,040
parallelograms now is your chance to
stick in the mast in a minute we're

106
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:35,050
stick in the mast in a minute we're

107
00:03:35,050 --> 00:03:36,810
stick in the mast in a minute we're
going to stick them back to back to make

108
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:36,820
going to stick them back to back to make

109
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:39,870
going to stick them back to back to make
the solid shape but before you do that

110
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:39,880
the solid shape but before you do that

111
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:42,210
the solid shape but before you do that
you can put in the mast or sail or

112
00:03:42,210 --> 00:03:42,220
you can put in the mast or sail or

113
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:43,800
you can put in the mast or sail or
anything else so you just put a bit of

114
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:43,810
anything else so you just put a bit of

115
00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:51,720
anything else so you just put a bit of
glue on that stick that in place and now

116
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:51,730
glue on that stick that in place and now

117
00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:54,660
glue on that stick that in place and now
you put glue all over one of these

118
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:54,670
you put glue all over one of these

119
00:03:54,670 --> 00:04:14,640
you put glue all over one of these
surfaces close it so there it is it's

120
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:14,650
surfaces close it so there it is it's

121
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:16,410
surfaces close it so there it is it's
the two parallelograms it's still not a

122
00:04:16,410 --> 00:04:16,420
the two parallelograms it's still not a

123
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:18,150
the two parallelograms it's still not a
stable shape because there's nothing

124
00:04:18,150 --> 00:04:18,160
stable shape because there's nothing

125
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:21,750
stable shape because there's nothing
joining these two outer sides so I'll

126
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:21,760
joining these two outer sides so I'll

127
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:26,240
joining these two outer sides so I'll
just glue the two boat pieces together

128
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:26,250


129
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:29,970
so these can be glued both at the same

130
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:29,980
so these can be glued both at the same

131
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:40,900
so these can be glued both at the same
time

132
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:40,910


133
00:04:40,910 --> 00:04:43,840
so you keep any measuring marks on the

134
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:43,850
so you keep any measuring marks on the

135
00:04:43,850 --> 00:05:05,710
so you keep any measuring marks on the
inside hidden from you now this will

136
00:05:05,710 --> 00:05:05,720
inside hidden from you now this will

137
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:08,440
inside hidden from you now this will
come down over here and stick to those

138
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:08,450
come down over here and stick to those

139
00:05:08,450 --> 00:05:11,170
come down over here and stick to those
two sides making the whole thing rigid

140
00:05:11,170 --> 00:05:11,180
two sides making the whole thing rigid

141
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:13,750
two sides making the whole thing rigid
so again we just put the glue on these

142
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:13,760
so again we just put the glue on these

143
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:32,740
so again we just put the glue on these
outer edges drop it into place and you

144
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:32,750
outer edges drop it into place and you

145
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:35,620
outer edges drop it into place and you
can just really Center this up by eye it

146
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:35,630
can just really Center this up by eye it

147
00:05:35,630 --> 00:05:39,130
can just really Center this up by eye it
doesn't really matter whether the box

148
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:39,140
doesn't really matter whether the box

149
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:43,840
doesn't really matter whether the box
shape is actually writing or not now we

150
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:43,850
shape is actually writing or not now we

151
00:05:43,850 --> 00:05:46,540
shape is actually writing or not now we
stuck the outside edges on you can see

152
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:46,550
stuck the outside edges on you can see

153
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:48,550
stuck the outside edges on you can see
as it closes the end of the boat

154
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:48,560
as it closes the end of the boat

155
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:52,270
as it closes the end of the boat
actually lifts up but so this is a

156
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:52,280
actually lifts up but so this is a

157
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:58,270
actually lifts up but so this is a
variation on the box mechanism 14 and at

158
00:05:58,270 --> 00:05:58,280
variation on the box mechanism 14 and at

159
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:00,730
variation on the box mechanism 14 and at
this point this is where you can start

160
00:06:00,730 --> 00:06:00,740
this point this is where you can start

161
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:03,480
this point this is where you can start
adding your decorations so in this case

162
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:03,490
adding your decorations so in this case

163
00:06:03,490 --> 00:06:06,070
adding your decorations so in this case
the owl is stuck to the side of the

164
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:06,080
the owl is stuck to the side of the

165
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,080
the owl is stuck to the side of the
