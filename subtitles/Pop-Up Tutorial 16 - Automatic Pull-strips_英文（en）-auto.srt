00:00:33,989 --> 00:00:36,779
this tutorial is about automatic bull

2
00:00:36,779 --> 00:00:36,789
this tutorial is about automatic bull

3
00:00:36,789 --> 00:00:39,389
this tutorial is about automatic bull
strips the principle is that you have a

4
00:00:39,389 --> 00:00:39,399
strips the principle is that you have a

5
00:00:39,399 --> 00:00:41,819
strips the principle is that you have a
strip of card and it's stuck to one side

6
00:00:41,819 --> 00:00:41,829
strip of card and it's stuck to one side

7
00:00:41,829 --> 00:00:45,029
strip of card and it's stuck to one side
as the page opens this strip goes across

8
00:00:45,029 --> 00:00:45,039
as the page opens this strip goes across

9
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:48,899
as the page opens this strip goes across
the other page under and out again and

10
00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:48,909
the other page under and out again and

11
00:00:48,909 --> 00:00:51,809
the other page under and out again and
as the page opens it pulls that strip

12
00:00:51,809 --> 00:00:51,819
as the page opens it pulls that strip

13
00:00:51,819 --> 00:00:54,899
as the page opens it pulls that strip
and so this end that's moving can be

14
00:00:54,899 --> 00:00:54,909
and so this end that's moving can be

15
00:00:54,909 --> 00:00:56,910
and so this end that's moving can be
used to make it raise up a bowing shape

16
00:00:56,910 --> 00:00:56,920
used to make it raise up a bowing shape

17
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:59,879
used to make it raise up a bowing shape
raise up a flap raise up a parallelogram

18
00:00:59,879 --> 00:00:59,889
raise up a flap raise up a parallelogram

19
00:00:59,889 --> 00:01:03,930
raise up a flap raise up a parallelogram
you know it has all these uses so I'll

20
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:03,940
you know it has all these uses so I'll

21
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:06,660
you know it has all these uses so I'll
show you examples of these other ones so

22
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:06,670
show you examples of these other ones so

23
00:01:06,670 --> 00:01:09,630
show you examples of these other ones so
here's one this is raising up a bow in

24
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:09,640
here's one this is raising up a bow in

25
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:13,170
here's one this is raising up a bow in
shape and in this case that the strip

26
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:13,180
shape and in this case that the strip

27
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:15,090
shape and in this case that the strip
that's pulling it just goes underneath

28
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:15,100
that's pulling it just goes underneath

29
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:17,969
that's pulling it just goes underneath
this edge you step down and it goes

30
00:01:17,969 --> 00:01:17,979
this edge you step down and it goes

31
00:01:17,979 --> 00:01:20,130
this edge you step down and it goes
through a slot underneath there but it

32
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:20,140
through a slot underneath there but it

33
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:22,499
through a slot underneath there but it
doesn't actually go under the page which

34
00:01:22,499 --> 00:01:22,509
doesn't actually go under the page which

35
00:01:22,509 --> 00:01:25,080
doesn't actually go under the page which
means this end this side here can tend

36
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:25,090
means this end this side here can tend

37
00:01:25,090 --> 00:01:27,810
means this end this side here can tend
to lift up a bit but in this example

38
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:27,820
to lift up a bit but in this example

39
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:31,139
to lift up a bit but in this example
it's actually behaving pretty well this

40
00:01:31,139 --> 00:01:31,149
it's actually behaving pretty well this

41
00:01:31,149 --> 00:01:33,569
it's actually behaving pretty well this
is another example here's the strip if

42
00:01:33,569 --> 00:01:33,579
is another example here's the strip if

43
00:01:33,579 --> 00:01:35,249
is another example here's the strip if
you look at it this way you can see it

44
00:01:35,249 --> 00:01:35,259
you look at it this way you can see it

45
00:01:35,259 --> 00:01:36,840
you look at it this way you can see it
does go under the page and come out

46
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:36,850
does go under the page and come out

47
00:01:36,850 --> 00:01:39,090
does go under the page and come out
again and that lifts this flap which

48
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:39,100
again and that lifts this flap which

49
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:42,330
again and that lifts this flap which
then lifts this parallelogram and then

50
00:01:42,330 --> 00:01:42,340
then lifts this parallelogram and then

51
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:48,120
then lifts this parallelogram and then
in this example here is this is the pull

52
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:48,130
in this example here is this is the pull

53
00:01:48,130 --> 00:01:50,099
in this example here is this is the pull
strip pulling up this bowing shape and

54
00:01:50,099 --> 00:01:50,109
strip pulling up this bowing shape and

55
00:01:50,109 --> 00:01:51,630
strip pulling up this bowing shape and
because it's a curved shape you can

56
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:51,640
because it's a curved shape you can

57
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:54,690
because it's a curved shape you can
stick straight pieces of card onto it at

58
00:01:54,690 --> 00:01:54,700
stick straight pieces of card onto it at

59
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:56,849
stick straight pieces of card onto it at
different points on the curve and they

60
00:01:56,849 --> 00:01:56,859
different points on the curve and they

61
00:01:56,859 --> 00:02:01,010
different points on the curve and they
will all lift up at different angles so

62
00:02:01,010 --> 00:02:01,020
will all lift up at different angles so

63
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:03,539
will all lift up at different angles so
I'll just show you one more example of

64
00:02:03,539 --> 00:02:03,549
I'll just show you one more example of

65
00:02:03,549 --> 00:02:05,940
I'll just show you one more example of
the mechanism this is the most simple

66
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:05,950
the mechanism this is the most simple

67
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:11,090
the mechanism this is the most simple
this is worms wiggle by David Pellom and

68
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:11,100
this is worms wiggle by David Pellom and

69
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:13,410
this is worms wiggle by David Pellom and
as you open this

70
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:13,420
as you open this

71
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:23,580
as you open this
it pulls the fake price across so now we

72
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:23,590
it pulls the fake price across so now we

73
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:25,949
it pulls the fake price across so now we
just make the simplest kind so you'll

74
00:02:25,949 --> 00:02:25,959
just make the simplest kind so you'll

75
00:02:25,959 --> 00:02:30,330
just make the simplest kind so you'll
need a base sheet something like this

76
00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:30,340
need a base sheet something like this

77
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:33,570
need a base sheet something like this
fold it in half crease it really

78
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:33,580
fold it in half crease it really

79
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:43,710
fold it in half crease it really
thoroughly right no take another sheet

80
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:43,720
thoroughly right no take another sheet

81
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:46,130
thoroughly right no take another sheet
of card and just cut it in half

82
00:02:46,130 --> 00:02:46,140
of card and just cut it in half

83
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:53,670
of card and just cut it in half
lengthways so draw a couple of

84
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:53,680
lengthways so draw a couple of

85
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,470
lengthways so draw a couple of
guidelines use your ruler to draw a

86
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:55,480
guidelines use your ruler to draw a

87
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:57,540
guidelines use your ruler to draw a
couple of parallel guide lines down the

88
00:02:57,540 --> 00:02:57,550
couple of parallel guide lines down the

89
00:02:57,550 --> 00:03:02,840
couple of parallel guide lines down the
length of it put the ruler in the middle

90
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:02,850


91
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:15,360
for the two guidelines

92
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:15,370


93
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:19,030
now folder a tab on to one end this is a

94
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:19,040
now folder a tab on to one end this is a

95
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:21,100
now folder a tab on to one end this is a
gluing tab so it's about half an inch

96
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:21,110
gluing tab so it's about half an inch

97
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:26,380
gluing tab so it's about half an inch
wide or one centimeter fold that really

98
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:26,390
wide or one centimeter fold that really

99
00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:32,340
wide or one centimeter fold that really
well the other end cut off about an inch

100
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:32,350
well the other end cut off about an inch

101
00:03:32,350 --> 00:03:35,020
well the other end cut off about an inch
two and a half centimeters something

102
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:35,030
two and a half centimeters something

103
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:37,480
two and a half centimeters something
like that just make it slightly shorter

104
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:37,490
like that just make it slightly shorter

105
00:03:37,490 --> 00:03:49,320
like that just make it slightly shorter
and fold a gluing tab on to that as well

106
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:49,330


107
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:54,550
like now take your base sheet put one

108
00:03:54,550 --> 00:03:54,560
like now take your base sheet put one

109
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:57,280
like now take your base sheet put one
name against the crease so it's like

110
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:57,290
name against the crease so it's like

111
00:03:57,290 --> 00:03:59,020
name against the crease so it's like
this here's the central gully of the

112
00:03:59,020 --> 00:03:59,030
this here's the central gully of the

113
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:03,699
this here's the central gully of the
base sheet and now fold it over so it's

114
00:04:03,699 --> 00:04:03,709
base sheet and now fold it over so it's

115
00:04:03,709 --> 00:04:09,180
base sheet and now fold it over so it's
just within the outer edge of the card

116
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:09,190


117
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:12,250
so that when the when the thing is flat

118
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:12,260
so that when the when the thing is flat

119
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:17,500
so that when the when the thing is flat
it doesn't doesn't just out now on the

120
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:17,510
it doesn't doesn't just out now on the

121
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:19,120
it doesn't doesn't just out now on the
long side this is where the strips going

122
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:19,130
long side this is where the strips going

123
00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:21,039
long side this is where the strips going
to be on this long side just draw a

124
00:04:21,039 --> 00:04:21,049
to be on this long side just draw a

125
00:04:21,049 --> 00:04:22,690
to be on this long side just draw a
little guideline here again it's about

126
00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:22,700
little guideline here again it's about

127
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:25,930
little guideline here again it's about
one centimeter in this helps the whole

128
00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:25,940
one centimeter in this helps the whole

129
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:27,640
one centimeter in this helps the whole
thing move more smoothly when you stick

130
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:27,650
thing move more smoothly when you stick

131
00:04:27,650 --> 00:04:28,500
thing move more smoothly when you stick
it together

132
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:28,510
it together

133
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:31,659
it together
now take a craft knife or scissors and

134
00:04:31,659 --> 00:04:31,669
now take a craft knife or scissors and

135
00:04:31,669 --> 00:04:34,600
now take a craft knife or scissors and
cut out the strip just a couple of

136
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:34,610
cut out the strip just a couple of

137
00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:36,610
cut out the strip just a couple of
millimeters on the inside of these guide

138
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:36,620
millimeters on the inside of these guide

139
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:39,159
millimeters on the inside of these guide
lines so that the strip you're making is

140
00:04:39,159 --> 00:04:39,169
lines so that the strip you're making is

141
00:04:39,169 --> 00:04:42,159
lines so that the strip you're making is
just going to be slightly narrower than

142
00:04:42,159 --> 00:04:42,169
just going to be slightly narrower than

143
00:04:42,169 --> 00:04:48,100
just going to be slightly narrower than
the guide lines you've drawn and then

144
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:48,110
the guide lines you've drawn and then

145
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:59,340
the guide lines you've drawn and then
cut along that second second guide

146
00:04:59,340 --> 00:04:59,350


147
00:04:59,350 --> 00:05:05,230
right now the other ends take out a

148
00:05:05,230 --> 00:05:05,240
right now the other ends take out a

149
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:08,170
right now the other ends take out a
piece in between the two guidelines and

150
00:05:08,170 --> 00:05:08,180
piece in between the two guidelines and

151
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:10,510
piece in between the two guidelines and
this one you start just a couple of meal

152
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:10,520
this one you start just a couple of meal

153
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:13,090
this one you start just a couple of meal
or a millimeter above the fold line and

154
00:05:13,090 --> 00:05:13,100
or a millimeter above the fold line and

155
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:16,540
or a millimeter above the fold line and
take it to a millimeter or two outside

156
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:16,550
take it to a millimeter or two outside

157
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:18,700
take it to a millimeter or two outside
the guidelines so you're getting a wider

158
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:18,710
the guidelines so you're getting a wider

159
00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:25,000
the guidelines so you're getting a wider
gap here and now you can can just trim

160
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:25,010
gap here and now you can can just trim

161
00:05:25,010 --> 00:05:27,220
gap here and now you can can just trim
all these gluing tabs just take those

162
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:27,230
all these gluing tabs just take those

163
00:05:27,230 --> 00:05:40,180
all these gluing tabs just take those
corners off okay now just fold it over

164
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:40,190
corners off okay now just fold it over

165
00:05:40,190 --> 00:05:42,460
corners off okay now just fold it over
this is your piece with a crease there

166
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:42,470
this is your piece with a crease there

167
00:05:42,470 --> 00:05:45,190
this is your piece with a crease there
just this fold is over and make sure

168

there's some clearance between the strip

176
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:57,290
there's some clearance between the strip

177
00:05:57,290 --> 00:06:02,770
there's some clearance between the strip
and these two tabs activation lay it in

178
00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:02,780
and these two tabs activation lay it in

179
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:05,260
and these two tabs activation lay it in
place so you've got the very tip of the

gully now these two tabs fold underneath

184
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:10,670
gully now these two tabs fold underneath

185
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:12,760
gully now these two tabs fold underneath
you put glue on them both glue them at

186
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:12,770
you put glue on them both glue them at

187
00:06:12,770 --> 00:06:14,380
you put glue on them both glue them at
the same time so they're going to be

188
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:14,390
the same time so they're going to be

189
00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:18,220
the same time so they're going to be
folded underneath like that put glue on

190
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:18,230
folded underneath like that put glue on

191
00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:21,220

them both all the tabs on this mechanism

193
00:06:21,230 --> 00:06:24,880
them both all the tabs on this mechanism
take quite a lot of stress so make sure

194
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:24,890
take quite a lot of stress so make sure

195
00:06:24,890 --> 00:06:27,790
take quite a lot of stress so make sure
the glue goes right up to the creases

196
00:06:27,790 --> 00:06:27,800
the glue goes right up to the creases

197
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:30,940
the glue goes right up to the creases
and you know that there they are well

198
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:30,950
and you know that there they are well

199
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:34,810
and you know that there they are well
glued put it underneath put the tip of

200
00:06:34,810 --> 00:06:34,820
glued put it underneath put the tip of

201
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:40,140

the pull strip up against the spine

202
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:40,150


203
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:44,860
press it down okay and you can just test

204
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:44,870
press it down okay and you can just test

205
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:46,900
press it down okay and you can just test
that it's working you can now you can

206
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:46,910
that it's working you can now you can

207
00:06:46,910 --> 00:06:48,460
that it's working you can now you can
just pull this and make sure that it is

208
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:48,470
just pull this and make sure that it is

209
00:06:48,470 --> 00:06:50,860
just pull this and make sure that it is
lifting up okay so that's lifting up all

210
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:50,870
lifting up okay so that's lifting up all

211
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:53,710
lifting up okay so that's lifting up all
right now you put glue with the tab flat

212
00:06:53,710 --> 00:06:53,720
right now you put glue with the tab flat

213
00:06:53,720 --> 00:07:00,100
right now you put glue with the tab flat
you put glue on the top of the tab this

214
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:00,110
you put glue on the top of the tab this

215
00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:02,350
you put glue on the top of the tab this
tab really takes a lot of stress so make

216
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:02,360
tab really takes a lot of stress so make

217
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:07,230
tab really takes a lot of stress so make
sure this is very very well glued

218
00:07:07,230 --> 00:07:07,240
sure this is very very well glued

219
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:09,870
sure this is very very well glued
and now you can close the base so it's

220
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:09,880
and now you can close the base so it's

221
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:11,279
and now you can close the base so it's
going to find its natural sticking

222
00:07:11,279 --> 00:07:11,289
going to find its natural sticking

223
00:07:11,289 --> 00:07:13,950
going to find its natural sticking
position give it a moment for the glue

224
00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:13,960
position give it a moment for the glue

225
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:18,659
position give it a moment for the glue
to go off and then open it up so there's

226
00:07:18,659 --> 00:07:18,669
to go off and then open it up so there's

227
00:07:18,669 --> 00:07:21,210
to go off and then open it up so there's
your bowing thing and then yeah if you

228
00:07:21,210 --> 00:07:21,220
your bowing thing and then yeah if you

229
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:24,659
your bowing thing and then yeah if you
want you can stick pieces onto onto this

230
00:07:24,659 --> 00:07:24,669
want you can stick pieces onto onto this

231
00:07:24,669 --> 00:07:27,540
want you can stick pieces onto onto this
so you can see the different angles that

232
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:27,550
so you can see the different angles that

233
00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:30,990
so you can see the different angles that
lift up according to where you stick

234
00:07:30,990 --> 00:07:31,000
lift up according to where you stick

235
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:35,339
lift up according to where you stick
them and you can stick them on either

236
00:07:35,339 --> 00:07:35,349
them and you can stick them on either

237
00:07:35,349 --> 00:07:37,740
them and you can stick them on either
side of this but if you stick them on

238
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:37,750
side of this but if you stick them on

239
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:39,719
side of this but if you stick them on
this side coming up this way they're

240
00:07:39,719 --> 00:07:39,729
this side coming up this way they're

241
00:07:39,729 --> 00:07:42,600
this side coming up this way they're
more likely to bashing to the base as it

242
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:42,610
more likely to bashing to the base as it

243
00:07:42,610 --> 00:07:44,670
more likely to bashing to the base as it
as it closes so the easiest one is to

244
00:07:44,670 --> 00:07:44,680
as it closes so the easiest one is to

245
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:47,820
as it closes so the easiest one is to
have them coming up this way and you

246
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:47,830
have them coming up this way and you

247
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:49,320
have them coming up this way and you
just need a little bit of glue these

248
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:49,330
just need a little bit of glue these

249
00:07:49,330 --> 00:07:52,860
just need a little bit of glue these
don't take any stress at all so there's

250
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:52,870
don't take any stress at all so there's

251
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:59,159
don't take any stress at all so there's
one stick one on the on the top I'll

252
00:07:59,159 --> 00:07:59,169
one stick one on the on the top I'll

253
00:07:59,169 --> 00:08:02,210
one stick one on the on the top I'll
stick it a completely different angle

254
00:08:02,210 --> 00:08:02,220
stick it a completely different angle

255
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:11,460
stick it a completely different angle
you can stick one halfway up so you can

256
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:11,470
you can stick one halfway up so you can

257
00:08:11,470 --> 00:08:13,560
you can stick one halfway up so you can
see that's something you can really see

258
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:13,570
see that's something you can really see

259
00:08:13,570 --> 00:08:16,200
see that's something you can really see
the plane then as you see I've done a

260
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:16,210
the plane then as you see I've done a

261
00:08:16,210 --> 00:08:18,480
the plane then as you see I've done a
bit low on this rough so they do get out

262
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:18,490
bit low on this rough so they do get out

263
00:08:18,490 --> 00:08:20,999
bit low on this rough so they do get out
you've also got a gully here so you can

264
00:08:20,999 --> 00:08:21,009
you've also got a gully here so you can

265
00:08:21,009 --> 00:08:27,810
you've also got a gully here so you can
you can stick other pop-ups in today so

266
00:08:27,810 --> 00:08:27,820
you can stick other pop-ups in today so

267
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:30,540
you can stick other pop-ups in today so
here we have um help the animals of

is built onto a parallelogram so on this
one the strip is attached here on this

330
00:10:04,699 --> 00:10:04,709
one the strip is attached here on this

331
00:10:04,709 --> 00:10:07,460
one the strip is attached here on this
side of the page then it goes across the

332
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:07,470
side of the page then it goes across the

333
00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:09,859
side of the page then it goes across the
spine and goes underneath and then here

334
00:10:09,859 --> 00:10:09,869
spine and goes underneath and then here

335
00:10:09,869 --> 00:10:12,319
spine and goes underneath and then here
you can see it comes up and it's lifting

336
00:10:12,319 --> 00:10:12,329
you can see it comes up and it's lifting

337
00:10:12,329 --> 00:10:13,939
you can see it comes up and it's lifting
a flap which is then lifting

338
00:10:13,939 --> 00:10:13,949
a flap which is then lifting

339
00:10:13,949 --> 00:10:16,519
a flap which is then lifting
parallelogram if I hold it up like that

340
00:10:16,519 --> 00:10:16,529
parallelogram if I hold it up like that

341
00:10:16,529 --> 00:10:18,970
parallelogram if I hold it up like that
you can see see the parallelogram

342
00:10:18,970 --> 00:10:18,980
you can see see the parallelogram

343
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:21,919
you can see see the parallelogram
lifting that and the helicopter east up

344
00:10:21,919 --> 00:10:21,929
lifting that and the helicopter east up

345
00:10:21,929 --> 00:10:24,439
lifting that and the helicopter east up
on top of the parallelogram so that's

346
00:10:24,439 --> 00:10:24,449
on top of the parallelogram so that's

347
00:10:24,449 --> 00:10:28,280
on top of the parallelogram so that's
that one next one is some Wizard of Oz

348
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:28,290
that one next one is some Wizard of Oz

349
00:10:28,290 --> 00:10:31,539
that one next one is some Wizard of Oz
there's a couple of examples in here so
