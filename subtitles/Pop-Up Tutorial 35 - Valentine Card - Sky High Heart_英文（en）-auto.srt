3
00:00:34,679 --> 00:00:37,319
this Valentine card is about how to

4
00:00:37,319 --> 00:00:37,329
this Valentine card is about how to

5
00:00:37,329 --> 00:00:39,989
this Valentine card is about how to
raise a heart really high mother page so

6
00:00:39,989 --> 00:00:39,999
raise a heart really high mother page so

7
00:00:39,999 --> 00:00:42,360
raise a heart really high mother page so
here's an example without the heart just

8
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:42,370
here's an example without the heart just

9
00:00:42,370 --> 00:00:45,149
here's an example without the heart just
showing how the whole thing folds down

10
00:00:45,149 --> 00:00:45,159
showing how the whole thing folds down

11
00:00:45,159 --> 00:00:48,389
showing how the whole thing folds down
and lifts up high there's another little

12
00:00:48,389 --> 00:00:48,399
and lifts up high there's another little

13
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:52,169
and lifts up high there's another little
example here it's the same idea that you

14
00:00:52,169 --> 00:00:52,179
example here it's the same idea that you

15
00:00:52,179 --> 00:00:54,919
example here it's the same idea that you
open the page and it just lifts that

16
00:00:54,919 --> 00:00:54,929
open the page and it just lifts that

17
00:00:54,929 --> 00:00:58,919
open the page and it just lifts that
it's all based on a really mechanism

18
00:00:58,919 --> 00:00:58,929
it's all based on a really mechanism

19
00:00:58,929 --> 00:01:00,449
it's all based on a really mechanism
that's expressed really well in this

20
00:01:00,449 --> 00:01:00,459
that's expressed really well in this

21
00:01:00,459 --> 00:01:03,419
that's expressed really well in this
book by Philippe look big bang pop and

22
00:01:03,419 --> 00:01:03,429
book by Philippe look big bang pop and

23
00:01:03,429 --> 00:01:05,940
book by Philippe look big bang pop and
the colors are really fantastic in this

24
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:05,950
the colors are really fantastic in this

25
00:01:05,950 --> 00:01:08,450
the colors are really fantastic in this
book the pop-up is actually fairly easy

26
00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:08,460
book the pop-up is actually fairly easy

27
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:11,459
book the pop-up is actually fairly easy
most of the time but the book I just

28
00:01:11,459 --> 00:01:11,469
most of the time but the book I just

29
00:01:11,469 --> 00:01:13,770
most of the time but the book I just
think the book is really beautiful this

30
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:13,780
think the book is really beautiful this

31
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:15,959
think the book is really beautiful this
is the one we're going for when you open

32
00:01:15,959 --> 00:01:15,969
is the one we're going for when you open

33
00:01:15,969 --> 00:01:18,899
is the one we're going for when you open
the page and it rises really high above

34
00:01:18,899 --> 00:01:18,909
the page and it rises really high above

35
00:01:18,909 --> 00:01:21,749
the page and it rises really high above
the page so you do need to measure in

36
00:01:21,749 --> 00:01:21,759
the page so you do need to measure in

37
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:24,480
the page so you do need to measure in
this it's based on the acute angle V

38
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:24,490
this it's based on the acute angle V

39
00:01:24,490 --> 00:01:27,420
this it's based on the acute angle V
I'll just look at this one this is the

40
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:27,430
I'll just look at this one this is the

41
00:01:27,430 --> 00:01:31,169
I'll just look at this one this is the
acute angle V fold the that's doing the

42
00:01:31,169 --> 00:01:31,179
acute angle V fold the that's doing the

43
00:01:31,179 --> 00:01:35,160
acute angle V fold the that's doing the
main lifting and then this bit here this

44
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:35,170
main lifting and then this bit here this

45
00:01:35,170 --> 00:01:38,310
main lifting and then this bit here this
is the asymmetric parallel fold which is

46
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:38,320
is the asymmetric parallel fold which is

47
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:42,469
is the asymmetric parallel fold which is
tutorial 6 I've measured up some an

48
00:01:42,469 --> 00:01:42,479
tutorial 6 I've measured up some an

49
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:45,480
tutorial 6 I've measured up some an
example here this is the base the V is

50
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:45,490
example here this is the base the V is

51
00:01:45,490 --> 00:01:48,719
example here this is the base the V is
going to stick down here the angle is 67

52
00:01:48,719 --> 00:01:48,729
going to stick down here the angle is 67

53
00:01:48,729 --> 00:01:50,700
going to stick down here the angle is 67
degrees and I measured both sides so

54
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:50,710
degrees and I measured both sides so

55
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:51,989
degrees and I measured both sides so
I'll be able to just stick it straight

56
00:01:51,989 --> 00:01:51,999
I'll be able to just stick it straight

57
00:01:51,999 --> 00:01:54,779
I'll be able to just stick it straight
down and then if you look at these they

58
00:01:54,779 --> 00:01:54,789
down and then if you look at these they

59
00:01:54,789 --> 00:01:57,959
down and then if you look at these they
have a piece here that's pushing up the

60
00:01:57,959 --> 00:01:57,969
have a piece here that's pushing up the

61
00:01:57,969 --> 00:02:00,419
have a piece here that's pushing up the
the arm that lifts right up this is

62
00:02:00,419 --> 00:02:00,429
the arm that lifts right up this is

63
00:02:00,429 --> 00:02:02,849
the arm that lifts right up this is
going to stick to this line 2,8

64
00:02:02,849 --> 00:02:02,859
going to stick to this line 2,8

65
00:02:02,859 --> 00:02:04,929
going to stick to this line 2,8
centimeters behind the

66
00:02:04,929 --> 00:02:04,939
centimeters behind the

67
00:02:04,939 --> 00:02:09,040
centimeters behind the
and then this is the actual piece itself

68
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:09,050
and then this is the actual piece itself

69
00:02:09,050 --> 00:02:12,880
and then this is the actual piece itself
this is the v-fold 77 degrees on each

70
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:12,890
this is the v-fold 77 degrees on each

71
00:02:12,890 --> 00:02:15,690
this is the v-fold 77 degrees on each
side this height is ten point five

72
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:15,700
side this height is ten point five

73
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:19,120
side this height is ten point five
centimeters and then where the arm this

74
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:19,130
centimeters and then where the arm this

75
00:02:19,130 --> 00:02:21,790
centimeters and then where the arm this
will be the arm that will stick behind

76
00:02:21,790 --> 00:02:21,800
will be the arm that will stick behind

77
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:25,110
will be the arm that will stick behind
it the arm sticks onto this upper limb

78
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:25,120
it the arm sticks onto this upper limb

79
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:28,780
it the arm sticks onto this upper limb
1,5 centimeters above the crease and the

80
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:28,790
1,5 centimeters above the crease and the

81
00:02:28,790 --> 00:02:31,540
1,5 centimeters above the crease and the
arm itself this takes some pressure so

82
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:31,550
arm itself this takes some pressure so

83
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:33,400
arm itself this takes some pressure so
it has to be double thickness I scored

84
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:33,410
it has to be double thickness I scored

85
00:02:33,410 --> 00:02:34,900
it has to be double thickness I scored
it down the middle it's got a tab on

86
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:34,910
it down the middle it's got a tab on

87
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:37,210
it down the middle it's got a tab on
each end the distance between the two

88
00:02:37,210 --> 00:02:37,220
each end the distance between the two

89
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:40,360
each end the distance between the two
tabs is eleven point eight centimeters

90
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:40,370
tabs is eleven point eight centimeters

91
00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:42,280
tabs is eleven point eight centimeters
so I'm going to glue that shut in a

92
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:42,290
so I'm going to glue that shut in a

93
00:02:42,290 --> 00:02:44,380
so I'm going to glue that shut in a
minute and just so you understand the

94
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:44,390
minute and just so you understand the

95
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:47,770
minute and just so you understand the
maps in this as you look at it here's

96
00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:47,780
maps in this as you look at it here's

97
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:51,190
maps in this as you look at it here's
the dimensions the lengths this is if

98
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:51,200
the dimensions the lengths this is if

99
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,789
the dimensions the lengths this is if
you look at it as it folds down it's

100
00:02:53,789 --> 00:02:53,799
you look at it as it folds down it's

101
00:02:53,799 --> 00:02:56,440
you look at it as it folds down it's
asymmetric you're actually working from

102
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:56,450
asymmetric you're actually working from

103
00:02:56,450 --> 00:02:58,690
asymmetric you're actually working from
here you've got the length of the

104
00:02:58,690 --> 00:02:58,700
here you've got the length of the

105
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:01,539
here you've got the length of the
pushing up strip plus the little piece

106
00:03:01,539 --> 00:03:01,549
pushing up strip plus the little piece

107
00:03:01,549 --> 00:03:05,559
pushing up strip plus the little piece
on the top that is this eleven point

108
00:03:05,559 --> 00:03:05,569
on the top that is this eleven point

109
00:03:05,569 --> 00:03:08,199
on the top that is this eleven point
eight plus one point five that gives you

110
00:03:08,199 --> 00:03:08,209
eight plus one point five that gives you

111
00:03:08,209 --> 00:03:10,630
eight plus one point five that gives you
thirteen point three and the other bit

112
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:10,640
thirteen point three and the other bit

113
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,789
thirteen point three and the other bit
on the base you've got two point eight

114
00:03:12,789 --> 00:03:12,799
on the base you've got two point eight

115
00:03:12,799 --> 00:03:16,630
on the base you've got two point eight
and on the upright you've got ten point

116
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:16,640
and on the upright you've got ten point

117
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,069
and on the upright you've got ten point
five so you add those together you've

118
00:03:18,069 --> 00:03:18,079
five so you add those together you've

119
00:03:18,079 --> 00:03:19,780
five so you add those together you've
got thirteen point three so that's

120
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:19,790
got thirteen point three so that's

121
00:03:19,790 --> 00:03:22,080
got thirteen point three so that's
giving you balance this is a balanced

122
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:22,090
giving you balance this is a balanced

123
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:25,210
giving you balance this is a balanced
asymmetric parallel fold I just think it

124
00:03:25,210 --> 00:03:25,220
asymmetric parallel fold I just think it

125
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:27,309
asymmetric parallel fold I just think it
all together make sure that it does

126
00:03:27,309 --> 00:03:27,319
all together make sure that it does

127
00:03:27,319 --> 00:03:31,690
all together make sure that it does
actually work this is going to go I'm

128
00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:31,700
actually work this is going to go I'm

129
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:34,690
actually work this is going to go I'm
going to stick it on this way round so

130
00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:34,700
going to stick it on this way round so

131
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:40,449
going to stick it on this way round so
all these dimensions as I've measured it

132
00:03:40,449 --> 00:03:40,459
all these dimensions as I've measured it

133
00:03:40,459 --> 00:03:43,090
all these dimensions as I've measured it
I can put glue on both sides at the same

134
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:43,100
I can put glue on both sides at the same

135
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:58,030
I can put glue on both sides at the same
time

136
00:03:58,030 --> 00:03:58,040


137
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:01,130
as usual glue all the way to the crease

138
00:04:01,130 --> 00:04:01,140
as usual glue all the way to the crease

139
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:03,740
as usual glue all the way to the crease
rather than the edge of the piece of

140
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:03,750
rather than the edge of the piece of

141
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:13,160
rather than the edge of the piece of
card glue this down and then we'll just

142
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:13,170
card glue this down and then we'll just

143
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:19,810
card glue this down and then we'll just
close that to make sure it works okay

144
00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:19,820


145
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:22,670
when you have a double thickness strip

146
00:04:22,670 --> 00:04:22,680
when you have a double thickness strip

147
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:24,380
when you have a double thickness strip
this is double thickness because it does

148
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:24,390
this is double thickness because it does

149
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:26,840
this is double thickness because it does
take some some pressure so I stuck this

150
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:26,850
take some some pressure so I stuck this

151
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:28,430
take some some pressure so I stuck this
down with all the measurements there

152
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:28,440
down with all the measurements there

153
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:30,830
down with all the measurements there
hidden behind the v-fold and the same

154
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:30,840
hidden behind the v-fold and the same

155
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:32,300
hidden behind the v-fold and the same
with this it's eleven point eight

156
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:32,310
with this it's eleven point eight

157
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:35,420
with this it's eleven point eight
centimeters between the two creases but

158
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:35,430
centimeters between the two creases but

159
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:37,370
centimeters between the two creases but
I'm going to fold that in glue it shut

160
00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:37,380
I'm going to fold that in glue it shut

161
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:41,120
I'm going to fold that in glue it shut
so you won't see that again all pull

162
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:41,130
so you won't see that again all pull

163
00:04:41,130 --> 00:04:43,670
so you won't see that again all pull
strips or push strips strips a double

164
00:04:43,670 --> 00:04:43,680
strips or push strips strips a double

165
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,020
strips or push strips strips a double

card a bit more rigid I would have made

this a bit stronger that's the basic

this a bit stronger that's the basic

this a bit stronger that's the basic
idea and as you close it it folds away

so no we have the sky high Valentine's

238

cards this is a smaller example and

240
00:07:04,069 --> 00:07:04,079
cards this is a smaller example and

241
00:07:04,079 --> 00:07:06,299
cards this is a smaller example and
because it's all smaller it doesn't

242
00:07:06,299 --> 00:07:06,309
because it's all smaller it doesn't

243
00:07:06,309 --> 00:07:07,679
because it's all smaller it doesn't
matter that the cards are not so rigid

244
00:07:07,679 --> 00:07:07,689
matter that the cards are not so rigid

245
00:07:07,689 --> 00:07:13,499
matter that the cards are not so rigid
and it does stands up it does seem to

just pull this heart off here and stick

252
00:07:20,759 --> 00:07:20,769
just pull this heart off here and stick

253
00:07:20,769 --> 00:07:24,389
just pull this heart off here and stick
it onto this one there is the sky high

254
00:07:24,389 --> 00:07:24,399
