00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:38,240
I'm going to show you how to make a

4
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:38,250
I'm going to show you how to make a

5
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:41,750
I'm going to show you how to make a
sitting dog pop up which is just a fun

6
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:41,760
sitting dog pop up which is just a fun

7
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:43,790
sitting dog pop up which is just a fun
way of using the acute angle v-folds

8
00:00:43,790 --> 00:00:43,800
way of using the acute angle v-folds

9
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:46,490
way of using the acute angle v-folds
this cute angle v-fold is quite an

10
00:00:46,490 --> 00:00:46,500
this cute angle v-fold is quite an

11
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:48,680
this cute angle v-fold is quite an
unusual mechanism not used very often

12
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:48,690
unusual mechanism not used very often

13
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:51,230
unusual mechanism not used very often
but this is quite a nice way of using it

14
00:00:51,230 --> 00:00:51,240
but this is quite a nice way of using it

15
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:53,300
but this is quite a nice way of using it
so here's the base sheet I've already

16
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:53,310
so here's the base sheet I've already

17
00:00:53,310 --> 00:00:55,550
so here's the base sheet I've already
folded it I'll just give it a bit more

18
00:00:55,550 --> 00:00:55,560
folded it I'll just give it a bit more

19
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:58,520
folded it I'll just give it a bit more
folding we're gonna use a sheet like

20
00:00:58,520 --> 00:00:58,530
folding we're gonna use a sheet like

21
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:03,950
folding we're gonna use a sheet like
this fold it in half and creased really

22
00:01:03,950 --> 00:01:03,960
this fold it in half and creased really

23
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:07,310
this fold it in half and creased really
well and I already started making one so

24
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:07,320
well and I already started making one so

25
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:11,030
well and I already started making one so
the stage I'd got to is this is the

26
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:11,040
the stage I'd got to is this is the

27
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,550
the stage I'd got to is this is the
original sheet here's how it fits onto

28
00:01:13,550 --> 00:01:13,560
original sheet here's how it fits onto

29
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:15,380
original sheet here's how it fits onto
the original sheet here's the first

30
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:15,390
the original sheet here's the first

31
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:17,690
the original sheet here's the first
crease and we put a crease coming up

32
00:01:17,690 --> 00:01:17,700
crease and we put a crease coming up

33
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:21,250
crease and we put a crease coming up
from that corner at roughly 45 degrees

34
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:21,260
from that corner at roughly 45 degrees

35
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:23,870
from that corner at roughly 45 degrees
depending really on what angle you want

36
00:01:23,870 --> 00:01:23,880
depending really on what angle you want

37
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:28,880
depending really on what angle you want
your dog's sitting at like that folded

38
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:28,890
your dog's sitting at like that folded

39
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:32,570
your dog's sitting at like that folded
back as you can see this is the crease

40
00:01:32,570 --> 00:01:32,580
back as you can see this is the crease

41
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:34,640
back as you can see this is the crease
so there's tabs along the bottom we've

42
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:34,650
so there's tabs along the bottom we've

43
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:40,640
so there's tabs along the bottom we've
cut tabs off cut the tabs off here we'll

44
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:40,650
cut tabs off cut the tabs off here we'll

45
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:44,060
cut tabs off cut the tabs off here we'll
sort that out some more in a minute we

46
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:44,070
sort that out some more in a minute we

47
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:46,130
sort that out some more in a minute we
also want the front of the dog to be

00:02:24,839 --> 00:02:24,849
in underneath or outside let's have a

75
00:02:24,849 --> 00:02:27,000
in underneath or outside let's have a
look how it's it's going to sit on the

76
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:27,010
look how it's it's going to sit on the

77
00:02:27,010 --> 00:02:32,250
look how it's it's going to sit on the
page like this like that probably have

78
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:32,260
page like this like that probably have

bend those over you open it up there's

91
00:02:55,299 --> 00:02:57,600
bend those over you open it up there's
the two tabs at the top then we're going

92
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:57,610
the two tabs at the top then we're going

93
00:02:57,610 --> 00:02:59,699
the two tabs at the top then we're going
to stick the head on with now we'll

94
00:02:59,699 --> 00:02:59,709
to stick the head on with now we'll

95
00:02:59,709 --> 00:03:04,080
to stick the head on with now we'll
stick the dog down on the page just see

you know what sort of angle you want him

99
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,789
you know what sort of angle you want him
at you want them really wide I think

100
00:03:08,789 --> 00:03:08,799
at you want them really wide I think

101
00:03:08,799 --> 00:03:10,380
at you want them really wide I think
pretty narrow is best

102
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:10,390
pretty narrow is best

103
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:13,289
pretty narrow is best
I might actually put the tail in before

104
00:03:13,289 --> 00:03:13,299
I might actually put the tail in before

105
00:03:13,299 --> 00:03:16,410
I might actually put the tail in before
we go any further so I'll just cut a

106
00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:16,420
we go any further so I'll just cut a

107
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:27,569

111
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:40,320
put a bit of glue on one side and put it

112
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:40,330
put a bit of glue on one side and put it

113
00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:45,869
put a bit of glue on one side and put it
in there so it shuts up

114
00:03:45,869 --> 00:03:45,879


115
00:03:45,879 --> 00:03:48,729
now we glue the two back legs maybe on

116
00:03:48,729 --> 00:03:48,739
now we glue the two back legs maybe on

117
00:03:48,739 --> 00:03:52,000
now we glue the two back legs maybe on
this version I made them slightly small

118
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:52,010
this version I made them slightly small

119
00:03:52,010 --> 00:03:57,790
this version I made them slightly small
for such a big dog so we'll just do one

120
00:03:57,790 --> 00:03:57,800
for such a big dog so we'll just do one

121
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,949
for such a big dog so we'll just do one
side and then we'll fold it down before

122
00:03:59,949 --> 00:03:59,959
side and then we'll fold it down before

123
00:03:59,959 --> 00:04:02,140
side and then we'll fold it down before
we do the other though he's going to be

124
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:02,150
we do the other though he's going to be

125
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:05,650
we do the other though he's going to be
something like this so there's one leg

126
00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:05,660
something like this so there's one leg

127
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:10,390
something like this so there's one leg
now close it down put a bit of glue on

128
00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:10,400
now close it down put a bit of glue on

129
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:17,710
now close it down put a bit of glue on
the other side should have done the

130
00:04:17,710 --> 00:04:17,720
the other side should have done the

131
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:27,040
the other side should have done the
front feet while I was at it but here we

132
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:27,050
front feet while I was at it but here we

133
00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:35,440
front feet while I was at it but here we
go shut this down sorry I've made a

134
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:35,450
go shut this down sorry I've made a

135
00:04:35,450 --> 00:04:37,600

00:04:58,270 --> 00:05:00,640
on that I did certainly be better
pointing in I've got that one pointing

148
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:00,650
pointing in I've got that one pointing

149
00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:05,620
pointing in I've got that one pointing
out I'll make this other one pointing in

150
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:05,630


151
00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:10,920

153
00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:14,020
I've glued it in place it's the glue is

154
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:14,030
I've glued it in place it's the glue is

155
00:05:14,030 --> 00:05:16,300
I've glued it in place it's the glue is
still soft so I'll just shut it down so

156
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:16,310
still soft so I'll just shut it down so

157
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:18,360
still soft so I'll just shut it down so
if it needs to move it can still move

158
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:18,370
if it needs to move it can still move

159
00:05:18,370 --> 00:05:21,550
if it needs to move it can still move
there we are that's the basic dog and

160
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:21,560
there we are that's the basic dog and

161
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:24,490
there we are that's the basic dog and
now we need a head so something like one

162
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:24,500
now we need a head so something like one

163
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:27,190
