00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:37,470
this u-turns about pyramids so here it

2
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:37,480
this u-turns about pyramids so here it

3
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:40,290
this u-turns about pyramids so here it
is a basic pyramids you can vary the

4
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:40,300
is a basic pyramids you can vary the

5
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:42,209
is a basic pyramids you can vary the
proportions and change the type of

6
00:00:42,209 --> 00:00:42,219
proportions and change the type of

7
00:00:42,219 --> 00:00:44,279
proportions and change the type of
pyramid that you're producing so this is

8
00:00:44,279 --> 00:00:44,289
pyramid that you're producing so this is

9
00:00:44,289 --> 00:00:47,729
pyramid that you're producing so this is
the most simple here's an example of one

10
00:00:47,729 --> 00:00:47,739
the most simple here's an example of one

11
00:00:47,739 --> 00:00:53,009
the most simple here's an example of one
that's tolerance deeper this one is

12
00:00:53,009 --> 00:00:53,019
that's tolerance deeper this one is

13
00:00:53,019 --> 00:00:55,250
that's tolerance deeper this one is
stuck down parallel to the spine whereas

14
00:00:55,250 --> 00:00:55,260
stuck down parallel to the spine whereas

15
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:59,250
stuck down parallel to the spine whereas
these ones are based on default so these

16
00:00:59,250 --> 00:00:59,260
these ones are based on default so these

17
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:02,549
these ones are based on default so these
the creases converge on the spine as it

18
00:01:02,549 --> 00:01:02,559
the creases converge on the spine as it

19
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:06,990
the creases converge on the spine as it
closes down the corner lift up this time

20
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:07,000
closes down the corner lift up this time

21
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,240
closes down the corner lift up this time
is stuck down parallel to the spine so

22
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:09,250
is stuck down parallel to the spine so

23
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:11,880
is stuck down parallel to the spine so
it closes up in a different way also

24
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:11,890
it closes up in a different way also

25
00:01:11,890 --> 00:01:14,429
it closes up in a different way also
this has six creases whereas the other

26
00:01:14,429 --> 00:01:14,439
this has six creases whereas the other

27
00:01:14,439 --> 00:01:16,319
this has six creases whereas the other
just has creases on the corners of the

28
00:01:16,319 --> 00:01:16,329
just has creases on the corners of the

29
00:01:16,329 --> 00:01:18,300
just has creases on the corners of the
pyramid this one has to have creases

30
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:18,310
pyramid this one has to have creases

31
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:20,760
pyramid this one has to have creases
above the spine there are other

32
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:20,770
above the spine there are other

33
00:01:20,770 --> 00:01:25,020
above the spine there are other
variations so there's and this is an

34
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:25,030
variations so there's and this is an

35
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:27,510
variations so there's and this is an
asymmetric pyramids quite complicated to

36
00:01:27,510 --> 00:01:27,520
asymmetric pyramids quite complicated to

37
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:32,480
asymmetric pyramids quite complicated to
calculate but they're quite quite fun

38
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:32,490
calculate but they're quite quite fun

39
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:35,999
calculate but they're quite quite fun
this is a another variation this is

40
00:01:35,999 --> 00:01:36,009
this is a another variation this is

41
00:01:36,009 --> 00:01:38,310
this is a another variation this is
actually a cone but it's the same

42
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:38,320
actually a cone but it's the same

43
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,440
actually a cone but it's the same
principle as the pyramid again it's

44
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:40,450
principle as the pyramid again it's

45
00:01:40,450 --> 00:01:42,660
principle as the pyramid again it's
stuck down parallel to the spine just

46
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:42,670
stuck down parallel to the spine just

47
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:45,270
stuck down parallel to the spine just
hasn't got any angle creases making

48
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:45,280
hasn't got any angle creases making

49
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:50,219
hasn't got any angle creases making
corners but it's the same basic shape so

50
00:01:50,219 --> 00:01:50,229
corners but it's the same basic shape so

51
00:01:50,229 --> 00:01:52,889
corners but it's the same basic shape so
this is a stretch pyramid it's a

52
00:01:52,889 --> 00:01:52,899
this is a stretch pyramid it's a

53
00:01:52,899 --> 00:01:55,649
this is a stretch pyramid it's a

to give the camel there is a very rigid

68
00:02:15,130 --> 00:02:15,140
to give the camel there is a very rigid

69
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:18,730
to give the camel there is a very rigid
shape so you can cut pieces away so I'll

70
00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:18,740
shape so you can cut pieces away so I'll

71
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:21,910
shape so you can cut pieces away so I'll
just show you how to make make a regular

00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:34,940
in half crease it really thoroughly and

77
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:37,180
in half crease it really thoroughly and
then you can take half a piece of card

78
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:37,190
then you can take half a piece of card

79
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:40,990
then you can take half a piece of card
you need a compass you need a scoring

80
00:02:40,990 --> 00:02:41,000
you need a compass you need a scoring

81
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,970
you need a compass you need a scoring
tool a ruler and the usual scissors and

82
00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:45,980
tool a ruler and the usual scissors and

83
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:49,060
tool a ruler and the usual scissors and
glue so take the compass mark where

84
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:49,070
glue so take the compass mark where

85
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:53,770
glue so take the compass mark where
you're going to put the point draw a

86
00:02:53,770 --> 00:02:53,780
you're going to put the point draw a

87
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:58,150
you're going to put the point draw a
semicircle the bigger the circle that

88
00:02:58,150 --> 00:02:58,160
semicircle the bigger the circle that

89
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:02,410

the flatter thee the pyramid can be you

90
00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:02,420
the flatter thee the pyramid can be you

91
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:05,410
the flatter thee the pyramid can be you
then adjust the the gap between the

92
00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:05,420
then adjust the the gap between the

93
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:07,809
then adjust the the gap between the
point and the pencil on your compass the

94
00:03:07,809 --> 00:03:07,819
point and the pencil on your compass the

95
00:03:07,819 --> 00:03:10,180
point and the pencil on your compass the
bigger the gap the flatter the pyramid

96
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:10,190
bigger the gap the flatter the pyramid

97
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:12,309
bigger the gap the flatter the pyramid
will be the smaller the gap the more

98
00:03:12,309 --> 00:03:12,319
will be the smaller the gap the more

99
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:15,699
will be the smaller the gap the more
steep and pointy it will be so it all

100
00:03:15,699 --> 00:03:15,709
steep and pointy it will be so it all

101
00:03:15,709 --> 00:03:17,710
steep and pointy it will be so it all
depends what type of pyramid you wanting

102
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:17,720
depends what type of pyramid you wanting

103
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:22,300
depends what type of pyramid you wanting
so make the first mark and measure off a

104
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:22,310
so make the first mark and measure off a

105
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:25,720
so make the first mark and measure off a
let's round the art do it again so these

106
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:25,730
let's round the art do it again so these

107
00:03:25,730 --> 00:03:30,870
let's round the art do it again so these
are the four base sides of the pyramid

108
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:30,880


109
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:35,710
so there's the four bases now you need

110
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:35,720
so there's the four bases now you need

111
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:38,560
so there's the four bases now you need
to score between those those marks and

112
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:38,570
to score between those those marks and

113
00:03:38,570 --> 00:03:41,050
to score between those those marks and
the and the points where the point of

114
00:03:41,050 --> 00:03:41,060
the and the points where the point of

115
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:47,590
the and the points where the point of
the compass was one I'll just note this

116
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:47,600
the compass was one I'll just note this

117
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:55,420
the compass was one I'll just note this
off store onto that

118
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:55,430


119
00:03:55,430 --> 00:04:13,070
two three four and the last one you'll

120
00:04:13,070 --> 00:04:13,080
two three four and the last one you'll

121
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:15,410
two three four and the last one you'll
also need two straight scored lines

122
00:04:15,410 --> 00:04:15,420
also need two straight scored lines

123
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:17,240
also need two straight scored lines
where the tabs that glue it to the page

124
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:17,250
where the tabs that glue it to the page

125
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:18,949
where the tabs that glue it to the page
you're going to be so we just put them

126
00:04:18,949 --> 00:04:18,959
you're going to be so we just put them

127
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:24,280
you're going to be so we just put them
adjacent to each other so there's one

128
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:24,290
adjacent to each other so there's one

129
00:04:24,290 --> 00:04:30,469
adjacent to each other so there's one
there's the other these other edges will

130
00:04:30,469 --> 00:04:30,479
there's the other these other edges will

131
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:32,240
there's the other these other edges will
just need to be cut off straight so

132
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:32,250
just need to be cut off straight so

133
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:35,060
just need to be cut off straight so
might as well just cut them off with the

134
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:35,070
might as well just cut them off with the

135
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:47,200
might as well just cut them off with the
ruler so you get a nice straight cut one

136
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:47,210


137
00:04:47,210 --> 00:04:51,500
and then this last side you're going to

138
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:51,510
and then this last side you're going to

139
00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:53,690
and then this last side you're going to
need a gluing tab to to pull the whole

140
00:04:53,690 --> 00:04:53,700
need a gluing tab to to pull the whole

141
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:57,520
need a gluing tab to to pull the whole
thing into shape so we'll just cut that

142
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:57,530
thing into shape so we'll just cut that

143
00:04:57,530 --> 00:05:03,110
thing into shape so we'll just cut that
ruling tab down you need to be aware of

144
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:03,120
ruling tab down you need to be aware of

145
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,879
ruling tab down you need to be aware of
the angle at the top of the pyramid and

146
00:05:04,879 --> 00:05:04,889
the angle at the top of the pyramid and

147
00:05:04,889 --> 00:05:07,550
the angle at the top of the pyramid and
make sure that the angle of the tab is

148
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:07,560
make sure that the angle of the tab is

149
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:09,980
make sure that the angle of the tab is
going to fit within that and then you

150
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:09,990
going to fit within that and then you

151
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:17,480
going to fit within that and then you
can cut down this line and you need to

152
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:17,490
can cut down this line and you need to

153
00:05:17,490 --> 00:05:20,300
can cut down this line and you need to
gluing tabs for lo these these scored

154
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:20,310
gluing tabs for lo these these scored

155
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:27,750
gluing tabs for lo these these scored
lines

156
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:27,760


157
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:39,850
right fold along creases not forgetting

158
00:05:39,850 --> 00:05:39,860
right fold along creases not forgetting

159
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:42,070
right fold along creases not forgetting
that the crease is where the tabs will

160
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:42,080
that the crease is where the tabs will

161
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:49,860
that the crease is where the tabs will
stick the whole thing to the page and

162
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:49,870


163
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:53,590
then you glue it shut

164
00:05:53,590 --> 00:05:53,600
then you glue it shut

165
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,420
then you glue it shut
make sure those creases are really good

166
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:55,430
make sure those creases are really good

167
00:05:55,430 --> 00:06:00,250
make sure those creases are really good
and then glue ease into shape so put

and then glue ease into shape so put

169
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:13,500
and then glue ease into shape so put
glue on that and glue it shut

170
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:13,510


171
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:16,090
so before you glue it to the page make

172
00:06:16,090 --> 00:06:16,100
so before you glue it to the page make

173
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:18,340
so before you glue it to the page make
sure that you're cutting and gluing will

174
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:18,350
sure that you're cutting and gluing will

175
00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:21,250
sure that you're cutting and gluing will
actually fold flat and make your base

176
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:21,260
actually fold flat and make your base

177
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:26,129
actually fold flat and make your base
sheet he's going to glue underneath so

178
00:06:26,129 --> 00:06:26,139
sheet he's going to glue underneath so

179
00:06:26,139 --> 00:06:28,420
sheet he's going to glue underneath so
look and make sure they're not going to

180
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:28,430
look and make sure they're not going to

181
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:31,960
look and make sure they're not going to
overlap and then this is going to stick

182
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:31,970
overlap and then this is going to stick

183
00:06:31,970 --> 00:06:35,409
overlap and then this is going to stick
down like this and you don't actually

184
00:06:35,409 --> 00:06:35,419
down like this and you don't actually

185
00:06:35,419 --> 00:06:37,390
down like this and you don't actually
need to measure where it's going to

186
00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:37,400
need to measure where it's going to

187
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:39,100
need to measure where it's going to
stick down just make sure that the

188
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:39,110
stick down just make sure that the

189
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:43,000
stick down just make sure that the
crease between the two tabs is on the

190
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:43,010
crease between the two tabs is on the

191
00:06:43,010 --> 00:06:45,370
crease between the two tabs is on the
line and make sure that the other grease

192
00:06:45,370 --> 00:06:45,380
line and make sure that the other grease

193
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:49,060
line and make sure that the other grease
is also on that spine line and then you

194
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:49,070
is also on that spine line and then you

195
00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:56,980
is also on that spine line and then you
can glue them both down at the same time

196
00:06:56,980 --> 00:06:56,990


197
00:06:56,990 --> 00:07:00,939
it just makes sure the two tabs are one

198
00:07:00,939 --> 00:07:00,949
it just makes sure the two tabs are one

199
00:07:00,949 --> 00:07:05,020
it just makes sure the two tabs are one
on each side make sure that they points

200
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:05,030
on each side make sure that they points

201
00:07:05,030 --> 00:07:07,600
on each side make sure that they points
the corners of the pyramid are flush

202
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:07,610
the corners of the pyramid are flush

203
00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:10,270
the corners of the pyramid are flush
with that line and then you can you can

204
00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:10,280
with that line and then you can you can

205
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:17,379
with that line and then you can you can
close it down press it down and there

206
00:07:17,379 --> 00:07:17,389

that disappears under the pyramid or you

216
00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:29,120
that disappears under the pyramid or you

217
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,640
that disappears under the pyramid or you
have it this way around so you get a

spine you can see what it's rigid shape

235
00:08:05,419 --> 00:08:07,270
spine you can see what it's rigid shape
it is that you can cut away an awful lot

236
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:07,280
it is that you can cut away an awful lot

237
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,430
it is that you can cut away an awful lot
of it and it still keeps its shape and

00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,860
of it and it still keeps its shape and
in fact there's two more pyramids inside

240
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:11,870
in fact there's two more pyramids inside

00:08:15,790 --> 00:08:15,800
it both parallel folds and you can see

243
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:18,339
it both parallel folds and you can see
this the folds over the spine that these

244
00:08:18,339 --> 00:08:18,349
this the folds over the spine that these

245
00:08:18,349 --> 00:08:20,830
this the folds over the spine that these
parallel folds need in this case they're

00:08:20,830 --> 00:08:20,840
parallel folds need in this case they're

247
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:23,939
parallel folds need in this case they're
going inwards rather than outwards and

is tutorial 14 but if you look at the

256
00:08:39,010 --> 00:08:39,020
is tutorial 14 but if you look at the

257
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:41,980
is tutorial 14 but if you look at the
nose cone of the plane that is a pyramid

that's a parallel fold pyramid it's

260
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:45,170
that's a parallel fold pyramid it's

261
00:08:45,170 --> 00:08:47,199
that's a parallel fold pyramid it's
stuck down to the two walls of the plane
