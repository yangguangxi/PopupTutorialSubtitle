1
00:00:33,610 --> 00:00:36,580
this tutorial is about palm strips these

2
00:00:36,580 --> 00:00:36,590
this tutorial is about palm strips these

3
00:00:36,590 --> 00:00:39,340
this tutorial is about palm strips these
are two-dimensional motions also called

4
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:39,350
are two-dimensional motions also called

5
00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:42,100
are two-dimensional motions also called
interactive mechanisms this is the most

6
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:42,110
interactive mechanisms this is the most

7
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:45,190
interactive mechanisms this is the most
simple as you pull the tab the image

8
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:45,200
simple as you pull the tab the image

9
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:47,979
simple as you pull the tab the image
changes behind the window this is the

10
00:00:47,979 --> 00:00:47,989
changes behind the window this is the

11
00:00:47,989 --> 00:00:50,050
changes behind the window this is the
basic pull strip that has all sorts of

12
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:50,060
basic pull strip that has all sorts of

13
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:52,000
basic pull strip that has all sorts of
applications I'll just show you the most

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:52,010
applications I'll just show you the most

15
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:55,110
applications I'll just show you the most
basic so here's another example that's

16
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:55,120
basic so here's another example that's

17
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:57,910
basic so here's another example that's
easier to see than the other one here

18
00:00:57,910 --> 00:00:57,920
easier to see than the other one here

19
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:59,440
easier to see than the other one here
again you've got the image changing

20
00:00:59,440 --> 00:00:59,450
again you've got the image changing

21
00:00:59,450 --> 00:01:02,560
again you've got the image changing
behind the window the fact is you have

22
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:02,570
behind the window the fact is you have

23
00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:04,689
behind the window the fact is you have
to think about with these are the full

24
00:01:04,689 --> 00:01:04,699
to think about with these are the full

25
00:01:04,699 --> 00:01:07,780
to think about with these are the full
strip itself and then the direction of

26
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:07,790
strip itself and then the direction of

27
00:01:07,790 --> 00:01:10,420
strip itself and then the direction of
movement is governed by these two

28
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:10,430
movement is governed by these two

29
00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:12,520
movement is governed by these two
sleeves I'll explain those in a minute

30
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:12,530
sleeves I'll explain those in a minute

31
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:15,399
sleeves I'll explain those in a minute
and this slit the slit in the page so

32
00:01:15,399 --> 00:01:15,409
and this slit the slit in the page so

33
00:01:15,409 --> 00:01:16,899
and this slit the slit in the page so
they control the direction of the

34
00:01:16,899 --> 00:01:16,909
they control the direction of the

35
00:01:16,909 --> 00:01:19,359
they control the direction of the
movement of the slit you also have a tab

36
00:01:19,359 --> 00:01:19,369
movement of the slit you also have a tab

37
00:01:19,369 --> 00:01:22,000
movement of the slit you also have a tab
that controls the amount of movement of

38
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:22,010
that controls the amount of movement of

39
00:01:22,010 --> 00:01:24,940
that controls the amount of movement of
this strip and you can either have one

40
00:01:24,940 --> 00:01:24,950
this strip and you can either have one

41
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:26,830
this strip and you can either have one
built in like I've done here or you can

42
00:01:26,830 --> 00:01:26,840
built in like I've done here or you can

43
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:28,570
built in like I've done here or you can
actually just stick a piece of card

44
00:01:28,570 --> 00:01:28,580
actually just stick a piece of card

45
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:31,210
actually just stick a piece of card
across like that so that as you pull it

46
00:01:31,210 --> 00:01:31,220
across like that so that as you pull it

47
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:32,890
across like that so that as you pull it
it'll move along and come up against

48
00:01:32,890 --> 00:01:32,900
it'll move along and come up against

49
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:35,260
it'll move along and come up against
this slit in the page I'll put one

50
00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:35,270
this slit in the page I'll put one

51
00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:37,270
this slit in the page I'll put one
together now so you can see how it

52
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:37,280
together now so you can see how it

53
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:41,590
together now so you can see how it
actually goes

54
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:41,600


55
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:44,600
these do tape measuring so I've had to

56
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:44,610
these do tape measuring so I've had to

57
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:46,700
these do tape measuring so I've had to
measure it and prepare it beforehand

58
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:46,710
measure it and prepare it beforehand

59
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:48,649
measure it and prepare it beforehand
rather than just doing it off the cuff

60
00:01:48,649 --> 00:01:48,659
rather than just doing it off the cuff

61
00:01:48,659 --> 00:01:51,830
rather than just doing it off the cuff
here this is the actual strip this is

62
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:51,840
here this is the actual strip this is

63
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,440
here this is the actual strip this is
where the two images are going to go to

64
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:54,450
where the two images are going to go to

65
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:56,899
where the two images are going to go to
make the strip strong score it down the

66
00:01:56,899 --> 00:01:56,909
make the strip strong score it down the

67
00:01:56,909 --> 00:01:59,600
make the strip strong score it down the
middle then crease it so rather than

68
00:01:59,600 --> 00:01:59,610
middle then crease it so rather than

69
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:02,240
middle then crease it so rather than
just laminating two pieces together by

70
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:02,250
just laminating two pieces together by

71
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:05,120
just laminating two pieces together by
having a crease and then gluing it you

72
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:05,130
having a crease and then gluing it you

73
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:08,300
having a crease and then gluing it you
get a far stronger strip if it was just

74
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:08,310
get a far stronger strip if it was just

75
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:10,309
get a far stronger strip if it was just
pulling then it doesn't matter if it's

76
00:02:10,309 --> 00:02:10,319
pulling then it doesn't matter if it's

77
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:12,050
pulling then it doesn't matter if it's
single thickness card but because you're

78
00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:12,060
single thickness card but because you're

79
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:14,330
single thickness card but because you're
going to have to pull it and push it you

80
00:02:14,330 --> 00:02:14,340
going to have to pull it and push it you

81
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:15,890
going to have to pull it and push it you
want it to be stuck together really

82
00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:15,900
want it to be stuck together really

83
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:18,050
want it to be stuck together really
strong otherwise it will tend to buckle

84
00:02:18,050 --> 00:02:18,060
strong otherwise it will tend to buckle

85
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:21,620
strong otherwise it will tend to buckle
so this is your pull strip I'll glue it

86
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:21,630
so this is your pull strip I'll glue it

87
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:32,309
so this is your pull strip I'll glue it
together right

88
00:02:32,309 --> 00:02:32,319


89
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:34,440
here's the sheet that it's going to go

90
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:34,450
here's the sheet that it's going to go

91
00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:36,380
here's the sheet that it's going to go
on so I've already cut the window in it

92
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:36,390
on so I've already cut the window in it

93
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:38,550
on so I've already cut the window in it
these are the places where the two

94
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:38,560
these are the places where the two

95
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,679
these are the places where the two
sleeves are going to fit this is the

96
00:02:40,679 --> 00:02:40,689
sleeves are going to fit this is the

97
00:02:40,689 --> 00:02:42,809
sleeves are going to fit this is the
slit that the thing goes through so I'll

98
00:02:42,809 --> 00:02:42,819
slit that the thing goes through so I'll

99
00:02:42,819 --> 00:02:46,920
slit that the thing goes through so I'll
just cut this when you cut one of these

100
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:46,930
just cut this when you cut one of these

101
00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:50,250
just cut this when you cut one of these
slits cut it back a couple of MIL at

102
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:50,260
slits cut it back a couple of MIL at

103
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:52,679
slits cut it back a couple of MIL at
each end so that the card can just lift

104
00:02:52,679 --> 00:02:52,689
each end so that the card can just lift

105
00:02:52,689 --> 00:02:55,349
each end so that the card can just lift
up ever so slightly that makes it the

106
00:02:55,349 --> 00:02:55,359
up ever so slightly that makes it the

107
00:02:55,359 --> 00:02:56,880
up ever so slightly that makes it the
whole thing just move that much more

108
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:56,890
whole thing just move that much more

109
00:02:56,890 --> 00:03:01,050
whole thing just move that much more
easily so these are the sleeves you have

110
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:01,060
easily so these are the sleeves you have

111
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:06,390
easily so these are the sleeves you have
two creases stick them down one on each

112
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:06,400
two creases stick them down one on each

113
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,789
two creases stick them down one on each
side of the window that the images are

114
00:03:08,789 --> 00:03:08,799
side of the window that the images are

115
00:03:08,799 --> 00:03:11,460
side of the window that the images are
going to appear in so just crease these

116
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:11,470
going to appear in so just crease these

117
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:18,599
going to appear in so just crease these
quite well glue it down but these you

118
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:18,609
quite well glue it down but these you

119
00:03:18,609 --> 00:03:20,429
quite well glue it down but these you
don't want too much glue or you want to

120
00:03:20,429 --> 00:03:20,439
don't want too much glue or you want to

121
00:03:20,439 --> 00:03:22,080
don't want too much glue or you want to
anything you're gluing like this you

122
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:22,090
anything you're gluing like this you

123
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:24,179
anything you're gluing like this you
need to make sure you let it dry because

124
00:03:24,179 --> 00:03:24,189
need to make sure you let it dry because

125
00:03:24,189 --> 00:03:26,940
need to make sure you let it dry because
if the glue oozing it does gum up the

126
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:26,950
if the glue oozing it does gum up the

127
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:28,860
if the glue oozing it does gum up the
works and things don't work so well so

128
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:28,870
works and things don't work so well so

129
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:32,159
works and things don't work so well so
that's one sleeve this is the other

130
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:32,169
that's one sleeve this is the other

131
00:03:32,169 --> 00:03:35,399
that's one sleeve this is the other
I've already scored it where it needs to

132
00:03:35,399 --> 00:03:35,409
I've already scored it where it needs to

133
00:03:35,409 --> 00:03:38,490
I've already scored it where it needs to
fold and you're adding glue always put

134
00:03:38,490 --> 00:03:38,500
fold and you're adding glue always put

135
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:40,199
fold and you're adding glue always put
glue on the small piece of card not the

136
00:03:40,199 --> 00:03:40,209
glue on the small piece of card not the

137
00:03:40,209 --> 00:03:42,599
glue on the small piece of card not the
big one so this sleeve is the small bit

138
00:03:42,599 --> 00:03:42,609
big one so this sleeve is the small bit

139
00:03:42,609 --> 00:03:44,640
big one so this sleeve is the small bit
and the base is the big bit so you put

140
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:44,650
and the base is the big bit so you put

141
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:49,259
and the base is the big bit so you put
the glue onto the sleeve stick it in

142
00:03:49,259 --> 00:03:49,269
the glue onto the sleeve stick it in

143
00:03:49,269 --> 00:03:52,349
the glue onto the sleeve stick it in
place now if we look at the pull strip

144
00:03:52,349 --> 00:03:52,359
place now if we look at the pull strip

145
00:03:52,359 --> 00:03:54,210
place now if we look at the pull strip
itself it's going to fit around this way

146
00:03:54,210 --> 00:03:54,220
itself it's going to fit around this way

147
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:56,580
itself it's going to fit around this way
around you'll see these sleeves have to

148
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:56,590
around you'll see these sleeves have to

149
00:03:56,590 --> 00:03:59,339
around you'll see these sleeves have to
be a couple of millimeters wider than

150
00:03:59,339 --> 00:03:59,349
be a couple of millimeters wider than

151
00:03:59,349 --> 00:04:02,699
be a couple of millimeters wider than
the strip itself on each side so they

152
00:04:02,699 --> 00:04:02,709
the strip itself on each side so they

153
00:04:02,709 --> 00:04:04,439
the strip itself on each side so they
don't actually grip it so they're going

154
00:04:04,439 --> 00:04:04,449
don't actually grip it so they're going

155
00:04:04,449 --> 00:04:07,649
don't actually grip it so they're going
to fold over like this when you close it

156
00:04:07,649 --> 00:04:07,659
to fold over like this when you close it

157
00:04:07,659 --> 00:04:10,170
to fold over like this when you close it
down you just need the smallest dab of

158
00:04:10,170 --> 00:04:10,180
down you just need the smallest dab of

159
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:13,170
down you just need the smallest dab of
glue so I'll just poke it through here

160
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:13,180
glue so I'll just poke it through here

161
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:14,089
glue so I'll just poke it through here
first

162
00:04:14,089 --> 00:04:14,099
first

163
00:04:14,099 --> 00:04:19,589
first
that moves nice and easy now we can take

164
00:04:19,589 --> 00:04:19,599
that moves nice and easy now we can take

165
00:04:19,599 --> 00:04:22,920
that moves nice and easy now we can take
this side close it down put the smallest

166
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:22,930
this side close it down put the smallest

167
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:25,710
this side close it down put the smallest
dab of glue there's no stress on this so

168
00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:25,720
dab of glue there's no stress on this so

169
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:27,870
dab of glue there's no stress on this so
it doesn't need much glue the main thing

170
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:27,880
it doesn't need much glue the main thing

171
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:30,330
it doesn't need much glue the main thing
is that it doesn't ooze and gum up the

172
00:04:30,330 --> 00:04:30,340
is that it doesn't ooze and gum up the

173
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:33,629
is that it doesn't ooze and gum up the
work so that's one sleeve and here's the

174
00:04:33,629 --> 00:04:33,639
work so that's one sleeve and here's the

175
00:04:33,639 --> 00:04:36,080
work so that's one sleeve and here's the
other one

177
00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:39,020
little bit of glue there

178
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:39,030
little bit of glue there

179
00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:43,980

00:05:37,290 --> 00:05:37,300
of pull strip this is a kind which this

215
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:39,090
of pull strip this is a kind which this
is really crude where you actually have

216
00:05:39,090 --> 00:05:39,100
is really crude where you actually have

217
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:42,270
is really crude where you actually have
a slot down the page and as you pull the

218
00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:42,280
a slot down the page and as you pull the

219
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:45,150
a slot down the page and as you pull the
pull strip it moves the image down the

220
00:05:45,150 --> 00:05:45,160
pull strip it moves the image down the

221
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:47,640
pull strip it moves the image down the
page if we look at the back of that all

222
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:47,650
page if we look at the back of that all

223
00:05:47,650 --> 00:05:50,490

you need is the slit in the page again

224
00:05:50,490 --> 00:05:50,500
you need is the slit in the page again

225
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:52,200
you need is the slit in the page again
it's been cut back slightly to make it

226
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:52,210
it's been cut back slightly to make it

227
00:05:52,210 --> 00:05:55,470
it's been cut back slightly to make it
move easily but the construction under

228
00:05:55,470 --> 00:05:55,480
move easily but the construction under

229
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:58,770
move easily but the construction under
here holds it in place and the length of

230
00:05:58,770 --> 00:05:58,780
here holds it in place and the length of

231
00:05:58,780 --> 00:06:02,159
here holds it in place and the length of
the slot governs how far it will move

232
00:06:02,159 --> 00:06:02,169
the slot governs how far it will move

233
00:06:02,169 --> 00:06:05,250
the slot governs how far it will move
I'll just make one of those real quickly

234
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:05,260
I'll just make one of those real quickly

235
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:12,710
I'll just make one of those real quickly
so just take a piece of card score it

236
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:12,720


237
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:17,529
cut it

238
00:06:17,529 --> 00:06:17,539


239
00:06:17,539 --> 00:06:30,680
fold it in half move it but there's a

240
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:30,690
fold it in half move it but there's a

241
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:33,529
fold it in half move it but there's a
pull strip ready to go now we need a

242
00:06:33,529 --> 00:06:33,539
pull strip ready to go now we need a

243
00:06:33,539 --> 00:06:36,320
pull strip ready to go now we need a
slot that it's going to fit through so

244
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:36,330
slot that it's going to fit through so

245
00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:38,089
slot that it's going to fit through so
again you need you do need to cut it

246
00:06:38,089 --> 00:06:38,099
again you need you do need to cut it

247
00:06:38,099 --> 00:06:41,080
again you need you do need to cut it
with a ruler this time really so I make

248
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:41,090
with a ruler this time really so I make

249
00:06:41,090 --> 00:06:47,420
with a ruler this time really so I make
slot like this and make it back two or

250
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:47,430
slot like this and make it back two or

251
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:53,830
slot like this and make it back two or
three millimeters wide make another cut

252
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:53,840


253
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:59,600
cut that out and then you're going to

254
00:06:59,600 --> 00:06:59,610
cut that out and then you're going to

255
00:06:59,610 --> 00:07:01,670
cut that out and then you're going to
need one slit at the end here so just

256
00:07:01,670 --> 00:07:01,680
need one slit at the end here so just

257
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:05,420
need one slit at the end here so just
judging by how wide that is and just

258
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:05,430
judging by how wide that is and just

259
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:10,070
judging by how wide that is and just
come across like this make the two

260
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:10,080
come across like this make the two

261
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:14,689
come across like this make the two
little cuts and now get to the crucial

262
00:07:14,689 --> 00:07:14,699
little cuts and now get to the crucial

263
00:07:14,699 --> 00:07:17,899
little cuts and now get to the crucial
bit you just need a piece like this so

264
00:07:17,899 --> 00:07:17,909
bit you just need a piece like this so

265
00:07:17,909 --> 00:07:27,020
bit you just need a piece like this so
you glue it onto the pull strip it needs

266
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:27,030
you glue it onto the pull strip it needs

267
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:31,790
you glue it onto the pull strip it needs
to come in and shut up you're going to

268
00:07:31,790 --> 00:07:31,800
to come in and shut up you're going to

269
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,709
to come in and shut up you're going to
have two small pieces like this that

270
00:07:33,709 --> 00:07:33,719
have two small pieces like this that

271
00:07:33,719 --> 00:07:36,560
have two small pieces like this that
shut up through the slot so here's the

272
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:36,570
shut up through the slot so here's the

273
00:07:36,570 --> 00:07:44,420
shut up through the slot so here's the
other side there yeah so these two ends

274
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:44,430
other side there yeah so these two ends

275
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:48,860
other side there yeah so these two ends
will stand up come up through the slot

276
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:48,870
will stand up come up through the slot

277
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:51,409
will stand up come up through the slot
we'll just glue those down as well just

278
00:07:51,409 --> 00:07:51,419
we'll just glue those down as well just

279
00:07:51,419 --> 00:07:53,890
we'll just glue those down as well just
put a bit of glue under here

280
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:53,900
put a bit of glue under here

281
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:58,749
put a bit of glue under here
this is extremely fast and prude and

282
00:07:58,749 --> 00:07:58,759
this is extremely fast and prude and

283
00:07:58,759 --> 00:08:04,010
this is extremely fast and prude and
just trim that down slightly so feed it

284
00:08:04,010 --> 00:08:04,020
just trim that down slightly so feed it

285
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:09,560
just trim that down slightly so feed it
through there the other ends come up

286
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:09,570
through there the other ends come up

287
00:08:09,570 --> 00:08:14,330
through there the other ends come up
through there they fold over and you can

288
00:08:14,330 --> 00:08:14,340
through there they fold over and you can

289
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:17,360
through there they fold over and you can
glue your image whatever it may be onto

290
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:17,370
glue your image whatever it may be onto

291
00:08:17,370 --> 00:08:22,730
glue your image whatever it may be onto
these two here

292
00:08:22,730 --> 00:08:22,740


293
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:26,010
and then you've got a piece that slides

294
00:08:26,010 --> 00:08:26,020
and then you've got a piece that slides

295
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:29,670
and then you've got a piece that slides
up and down the page like that there's

296
00:08:29,670 --> 00:08:29,680
up and down the page like that there's

297
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,920
up and down the page like that there's
one here that there's a variation so

298
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:31,930
one here that there's a variation so

299
00:08:31,930 --> 00:08:34,110
one here that there's a variation so
this is the main one like I've just made

300
00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:34,120
this is the main one like I've just made

301
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:36,990
this is the main one like I've just made
but this is a strip with three creases

302
00:08:36,990 --> 00:08:37,000
but this is a strip with three creases

303
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,990
but this is a strip with three creases
in it this end is glued on to the

304
00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:40,000
in it this end is glued on to the

305
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,480
in it this end is glued on to the
equivalent of this this end is glued on

306
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:42,490
equivalent of this this end is glued on

307
00:08:42,490 --> 00:08:45,270
equivalent of this this end is glued on
to the page so as you pull this you get

308
00:08:45,270 --> 00:08:45,280
to the page so as you pull this you get

309
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:48,930
to the page so as you pull this you get
this rising up 3d shape there's another

310
00:08:48,930 --> 00:08:48,940
this rising up 3d shape there's another

311
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:51,360
this rising up 3d shape there's another
one here where I've actually stuck a

312
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:51,370
one here where I've actually stuck a

313
00:08:51,370 --> 00:08:55,830
one here where I've actually stuck a
mask down over the works so this one as

314
00:08:55,830 --> 00:08:55,840
mask down over the works so this one as

315
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:58,410
mask down over the works so this one as
you pull it you see the jaw drop and the

316
00:08:58,410 --> 00:08:58,420
you pull it you see the jaw drop and the

317
00:08:58,420 --> 00:09:01,050
you pull it you see the jaw drop and the
eyes change this one I actually made

318
00:09:01,050 --> 00:09:01,060
eyes change this one I actually made

319
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:02,610
eyes change this one I actually made
before I fully understood this mechanism

320
00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:02,620
before I fully understood this mechanism

321
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:05,190
before I fully understood this mechanism
so when you look you'll see that as you

322
00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:05,200
so when you look you'll see that as you

323
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,140
so when you look you'll see that as you
put it down there's two which is

324
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:07,150
put it down there's two which is

325
00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:09,390
put it down there's two which is
unnecessary you only actually need one I

326
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:09,400

actually out of print but I think it's
