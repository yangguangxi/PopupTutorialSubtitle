2
00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:44,810
materials we'll be using a glue scissors

3
00:00:44,810 --> 00:00:48,230
and cart and I've explained all about

4
00:00:48,230 --> 00:00:50,690
these in the introduction to this series

5
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:59,149
of tutorials so there are three basic

6
00:00:59,149 --> 00:01:02,059
types of parallel folds this is the

7
00:01:02,059 --> 00:01:03,890
parallelogram that we looked at in

8
00:01:03,890 --> 00:01:06,799
parallel folds part one and when when

9
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:08,630
the page is flat the parallelogram goes

10
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:11,810
flat the other two types they stay in

11
00:01:11,810 --> 00:01:14,869
dimension when the page is flat so first

12
00:01:14,869 --> 00:01:17,689
kind this is the basic parallel fold

13
00:01:17,689 --> 00:01:21,200
equal the lengths on each side of the

14
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,119
pop-up are both the same and the

15
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:25,729
distance out from the central gully of

16
00:01:25,729 --> 00:01:27,709
the base they're both the same so on the

17
00:01:27,709 --> 00:01:29,420
Left you've got a short length in a long

18
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:31,520
one and on the right you've got a short

19
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:32,840
length and a long one

20
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:35,420
we'll be dealing with that today and the

21
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:37,579
other one is the asymmetric parallel

22
00:01:37,579 --> 00:01:39,829
fold so here's the asymmetric parallel

23
00:01:39,829 --> 00:01:41,990
fold all four lengths are different

24
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:44,359
you've got a short length on on the base

25
00:01:44,359 --> 00:01:46,849
and a long one and a long length on the

26
00:01:46,849 --> 00:01:49,069
pop-up and the short one on the left

27
00:01:49,069 --> 00:01:51,409
you've got a short base long piece on

28
00:01:51,409 --> 00:01:54,200
the pop-up on the right you've got a

29
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:56,209
long piece on the base and a short piece

30
00:01:56,209 --> 00:02:00,859
on the pop-up and the base plus the plus

31
00:02:00,859 --> 00:02:03,109
the pop-up on each side paid balance so

32
00:02:03,109 --> 00:02:07,069
as you close it the pop-up closes so

33
00:02:07,069 --> 00:02:09,160
we're going to be dealing with these two

34
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:18,750
now I say you have to make one of these

35
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:21,310
basic parallel columns you take a base

36
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:30,310
sheet fold it in half crease the base

37
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:38,260
really thoroughly and then we take a

38
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:45,150
piece to build with let's have pink bit

39
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:47,790
okay I'm going to actually show you

40
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:50,590
three different variations of this so

41
00:02:50,590 --> 00:03:00,730
we'll just cut off three pieces so

42
00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:04,000
there's no importance to the dimensions

43
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,300
of these they're just as you know

44
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:09,160
whatever whatever you want for your

45
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:18,670
design basically so this is the first

46
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:21,600
time I'll make so take the piece of card

47
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:25,209
fold this in half it's symmetrical so

48
00:03:25,209 --> 00:03:27,670
it's folded in half creased really

49
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:30,459
thoroughly and then with it folded in

50
00:03:30,459 --> 00:03:33,280
half fold gluing tabs onto the outer

51
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:39,070
edges fold these thoroughly open it up

52
00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:44,040
and fold fold the creases individually

53
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:48,850
and the same on the other end from there

54
00:03:48,850 --> 00:03:58,540
night I always just trim off the corners

55
00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:03,260
right and this it's depending on what

56
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:05,870
you want in your design it can be it can

57
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:08,360
be glued down really close to the spine

58
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:10,160
so you've got a tall thin shape or you

59
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:13,580
can go flatter and flatter further and

60
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:15,140
further you can even stick it out so

61
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:17,900
it's flat then it'll still work I'll

62
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:19,609
show you one of those in a book in a

63
00:04:19,609 --> 00:04:21,950
minute so we'll just glue this on so

64
00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:23,660
we've got the two lengths on the pop-up

65
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:26,330
they're both the same so we need the two

66
00:04:26,330 --> 00:04:28,370
lengths on the base to be the same as

67
00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:33,979
well so put just put glue just on one

68
00:04:33,979 --> 00:04:40,790
end so use the glue on one end smear it

69
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:46,550
to the crease and glue it down I'm going

70
00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:49,220
about two centimeters out actually I

71
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:51,020
want it a bit higher up the page so I'm

72
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:54,200
gonna put two more on the same page so

73
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:58,370
there's that soundly glued put the put

74
00:04:58,370 --> 00:05:01,280
the pop-up into it's close position put

75
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,640
glue on the other end

76
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:11,750
smear it up close the base so it finds

77
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:17,990
its natural sticking position there it

78
00:05:17,990 --> 00:05:21,620
is the basic symmetric parallel fold the

79
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:23,750
two loads on the pop-up are the same and

80
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:25,370
the two lengths on the base of the same

81
00:05:25,370 --> 00:05:29,090
so here's the second variation so this

82
00:05:29,090 --> 00:05:30,950
is it it's very similar to the first

83
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:34,190
except it's got a flat plain on the top

84
00:05:34,190 --> 00:05:37,900
so I'll turn this around so you can see

85
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:41,600
see how it works better so again we take

86
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:44,660
this the strip of card we fold it in the

87
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:49,130
middle we fold it well though in this

88
00:05:49,130 --> 00:05:52,760
case it's not quite as important we we

89
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:55,070
fold a tab onto each end again we want

90
00:05:55,070 --> 00:05:57,289
it all symmetrical so we fold the gluing

91
00:05:57,289 --> 00:06:00,039
tabs with the whole piece folded in half

92
00:06:00,039 --> 00:06:05,289
so here are the gluing tabs fold them

93
00:06:05,289 --> 00:06:07,909
fold them well fold them individually

94
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:09,030
fold them backwards

95
00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:18,210
but with though is I'll just trim off

96
00:06:18,210 --> 00:06:26,250
the corners right and in this case to

97
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:28,620
get the flat piece on the top you just

98
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:32,270
put a bit of put a bit of glue into the

99
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:36,840
into the top of the top of the pop-up so

100
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:42,270
there's some glue though and close it

101
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:46,020
down and this one because I'm making it

102
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:48,120
with such a short piece you can't go

103
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:49,590
really wide so we're going to have it

104
00:06:49,590 --> 00:06:53,100
much closer closer to the spine the tabs

105
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:55,919
can either be sticking out like this or

106
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:57,840
you can fold them away underneath I

107
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,940
think actually in this case is quite

108
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:01,260
interesting having them on the outside

109
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:04,350
so I'm going to glue them put the glue

110
00:07:04,350 --> 00:07:07,440
on the outside and glue one side first

111
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:11,310
so in order to get the symmetry we'll

112
00:07:11,310 --> 00:07:13,890
glue one side first and glue it into

113
00:07:13,890 --> 00:07:20,540
place so here we are

114
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:23,669
and then we close the close the pop-up

115
00:07:23,669 --> 00:07:27,900
piece down put glue on the other other

116
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:37,800
tab smear it to the edges and close the

117
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:40,020
base so it finds its natural sticking

118
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:44,640
positions so there's the second

119
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:47,490
variation the third one is even more

120
00:07:47,490 --> 00:07:52,740
simple the third one fold it in half and

121
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:55,500
this time there are no gluing terms this

122
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:58,290
time we're making a curved shape these

123
00:07:58,290 --> 00:08:01,830
are quite unusually pop-up so this time

124
00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:04,680
we just put a little bit of glue on the

125
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:07,979
outside edges of the the pop-up we can

126
00:08:07,979 --> 00:08:14,160
do both at the same time but so just

127
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:17,849
smear the glue onto the onto the bottom

128
00:08:17,849 --> 00:08:23,259
of the outside edges of the popper

129
00:08:23,259 --> 00:08:27,919
and then set it into there this is

130
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:30,169
actually slightly fat so I'm just going

131
00:08:30,169 --> 00:08:33,050
to take a srimad piece off so I'm fit

132
00:08:33,050 --> 00:08:39,289
within your page right put that into the

133
00:08:39,289 --> 00:08:46,700
flush into the gully close the base open

134
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:48,769
it up and we're getting a curve shape so

135
00:08:48,769 --> 00:08:51,880
these are three three variations on the

136
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:55,010
symmetric parallel fold or give you

137
00:08:55,010 --> 00:08:56,779
different different potential when

138
00:08:56,779 --> 00:08:59,060
you're doing your pop-up designs oh I'll

139
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:02,240
show you something of a book now so this

140
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:07,339
is this is robots by yumping Caskey if

141
00:09:07,339 --> 00:09:11,209
we look at the final spreads this this

142
00:09:11,209 --> 00:09:13,339
is their parallel folds this is an

143
00:09:13,339 --> 00:09:16,430
equilateral parallel for both their both

144
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:19,399
sides are the same it actually the

145
00:09:19,399 --> 00:09:21,410
lengths on the pop-up are the same as on

146
00:09:21,410 --> 00:09:24,230
the on the base so when the base is flat

147
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:28,010
the whole pop-up post flow so that

148
00:09:28,010 --> 00:09:30,589
that's an equilateral parallel fold

149
00:09:30,589 --> 00:09:32,930
there if we look to the other end of the

150
00:09:32,930 --> 00:09:35,480
book and there's just a very small

151
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:39,020
example here this the head I think she's

152
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:41,000
a robot the head of the robot is

153
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,490
parallel folds and her head scarf is so

154
00:09:43,490 --> 00:09:45,920
these are the same type of paranoia

155
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:49,520
folds as we made the first one right

156
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:53,029
here we turn it round we can see it more

157
00:09:53,029 --> 00:09:56,360
clearly here's the head of the robot

158
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:58,880
we've got two you've got the head is one

159
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:02,029
parallel fold and the head scarf is

160
00:10:02,029 --> 00:10:04,850
another as as you close it you can see

161
00:10:04,850 --> 00:10:08,000
it and then this one the lengths on the

162
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,829
pop-up are bigger than the notes on the

163
00:10:09,829 --> 00:10:13,550
base that's why it stands up in 3d and

164
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:15,320
there's a final one I've got here that

165
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:17,899
roaring lion tales by ron van der Meer

166
00:10:17,899 --> 00:10:22,399
and this this is a parallel fold it's a

167
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:23,779
massive parallel fold

168
00:10:23,779 --> 00:10:27,019
it's got added added creases which are

169
00:10:27,019 --> 00:10:28,940
what sculpt the shape so if you pull it

170
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:32,660
out pull out these folds you can see

171
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:33,770
that what we've got here

172
00:10:33,770 --> 00:10:37,070
it's just one big big parallel fold as

173
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:40,460
you as you close it the whole thing the

174
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:42,800
whole thing goes flat and by adding

175
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:45,710
these extra creases he's done a

176
00:10:45,710 --> 00:10:48,230
beautiful sculptural effect on this

177
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:52,010
pop-up so he's created a real 3d shape

178
00:10:52,010 --> 00:10:54,800
out of the parallel fold by adding

179
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,210
adding extra creases

180
00:10:56,210 --> 00:10:59,720
he's also cut a hole in one side so he's

181
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:01,820
really gone to turn you can look inside

182
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:04,820
and and see inside the structure the

183
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:06,470
palm trees they're coming up through

184
00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:08,900
slots the slots are another another

185
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:11,600
tutorial later in this series that's the

186
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:14,450
end of the symmetric parallel fault now

187
00:11:14,450 --> 00:11:16,910
I'll show you the asymmetric parallel

188
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:25,340
fold this is an example all four lengths

189
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:29,510
are different the shot to a short in a

190
00:11:29,510 --> 00:11:31,490
long length on the base and I shortened

191
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:34,010
a long length on the on the pop-up and

192
00:11:34,010 --> 00:11:35,630
it's important to have the lower length

193
00:11:35,630 --> 00:11:37,880
on the pop up above the short length on

194
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:41,180
the base and vice versa the short length

195
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:43,280
on the pop-up above the long length I

196
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:47,210
can actually do a really quick diagram

197
00:11:47,210 --> 00:11:53,570
of how this how this works mathematic

198
00:11:53,570 --> 00:11:56,480
knees basically you have the here's your

199
00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:00,710
here's your book and you've got the

200
00:12:00,710 --> 00:12:06,590
pop-up is something like this so you

201
00:12:06,590 --> 00:12:09,740
could call it if this was one this

202
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:13,610
length was four this was three this was

203
00:12:13,610 --> 00:12:16,640
two so from one side from here to here

204
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:19,340
well weigh as 1 plus 4 and the other way

205
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:22,490
3 plus 2 let me just show you it's got

206
00:12:22,490 --> 00:12:24,560
to balance on each side so on the left

207
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:27,560
on the base you got 3 on the pop-up

208
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:29,960
you've got 2 on the other side and the

209
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:32,300
base you've got 1 on the pop up you've

210
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:36,170
got 4 so you've got 5 the sum is 5 on

211
00:12:36,170 --> 00:12:38,570
each side the other thing to make it

212
00:12:38,570 --> 00:12:40,820
stand up the pop-up has to be bigger

213
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:43,310
than the base so on the base you've got

214
00:12:43,310 --> 00:12:46,760
3 plus 1 on the pop-up you've got

215
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:48,710
four plus two so the base length is

216
00:12:48,710 --> 00:12:51,680
total total for the pop up length for

217
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:55,160
total is six so now we'll just make one

218
00:12:55,160 --> 00:13:11,990
of those baseships bonded in power and

219
00:13:11,990 --> 00:13:15,770
this film this one is similar to the

220
00:13:15,770 --> 00:13:17,780
ones we just made there are actually two

221
00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:23,660
variations so take a piece of card to

222
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:30,280
make them reads and this will do so just

223
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:33,620
I'll just cut a narrow strip off on one

224
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:49,850
side so we folder tab onto each end and

225
00:13:49,850 --> 00:13:53,300
then fold them really thoroughly as

226
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:57,440
usual cut off the corners so you don't

227
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:07,040
snag against anything and then fold fold

228
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:10,370
1/3 D and the third parallel fold you

229
00:14:10,370 --> 00:14:14,150
know somewhere well off center so there

230
00:14:14,150 --> 00:14:22,700
it is so we've got a short length and a

231
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:25,280
long length now in this type you again

232
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:27,320
simulated a parallelogram

233
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:30,650
you actually line up the central fold of

234
00:14:30,650 --> 00:14:33,820
the pop-up with the gully of the base

235
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:37,700
mark the mark the short sides you only

236
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:39,230
need a little mark here because you're

237
00:14:39,230 --> 00:14:40,880
not going to be sticking to that mark

238
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,920
you just need to know how long the short

239
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:46,670
side is and now the crucial bit you flip

240
00:14:46,670 --> 00:14:48,260
it over so you're going to be sticking

241
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:52,010
the long side somewhere somewhere in

242
00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:55,630
that region so put some glue on that

243
00:14:55,630 --> 00:14:57,860
long tab

244
00:14:57,860 --> 00:15:03,769
and the important thing is don't stick

245
00:15:03,769 --> 00:15:05,630
it don't stick it to the mark if you

246
00:15:05,630 --> 00:15:07,339
stick it to the mark what you'll get is

247
00:15:07,339 --> 00:15:09,649
a parallelogram so in this case you

248
00:15:09,649 --> 00:15:11,360
stick it closer to the spine than the

249
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:15,470
mark so just I'll just stick it about

250
00:15:15,470 --> 00:15:18,470
halfway and according to where you stick

251
00:15:18,470 --> 00:15:20,060
it it will give you different shapes so

252
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:23,600
stick it about half way fold the whole

253
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:26,079
piece into its closed position

254
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:35,860
put glue on the other tab here we are

255
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:39,410
smear it right up to the crease and then

256
00:15:39,410 --> 00:15:43,070
folder fold the base shut so this one is

257
00:15:43,070 --> 00:15:45,140
actually gonna stick out how it's

258
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:47,779
slightly this is this is just classic

259
00:15:47,779 --> 00:15:49,490
when you're doing a rough you'll

260
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:53,000
regularly get the bits that stick out so

261
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,589
there it is this is the asymmetric

262
00:15:54,589 --> 00:15:57,350
parallel for both the asymmetric

263
00:15:57,350 --> 00:15:59,839
parallel fold and the symmetric parallel

264
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:01,970
fold they're both really useful for

265
00:16:01,970 --> 00:16:05,510
other mechanisms for more complicated

266
00:16:05,510 --> 00:16:07,519
method mechanisms there the analyzed

267
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:09,410
structure for floating planes and you

268
00:16:09,410 --> 00:16:13,190
can raise planes above the base using

269
00:16:13,190 --> 00:16:14,329
these two and then building

270
00:16:14,329 --> 00:16:16,519
parallelograms onto them and we will

271
00:16:16,519 --> 00:16:18,290
deal with that in another tutorial

272
00:16:18,290 --> 00:16:21,920
on floating planes so I'll just I was

273
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:23,930
just going to show you how to add

274
00:16:23,930 --> 00:16:27,980
another asymmetric bendy shape so in

275
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:30,380
that case yeah you take the take your

276
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:33,290
card and in this case you actually fold

277
00:16:33,290 --> 00:16:35,180
it in the middle so you make a crease

278
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:38,690
right in the middle followed that pretty

279
00:16:38,690 --> 00:16:42,170
well and then you put you put glue on

280
00:16:42,170 --> 00:16:44,570
one one end you putting it on the

281
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:48,920
outside you you just glued quite a short

282
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:51,980
amount of the card on the other end

283
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:55,550
again on the outside you glue a longer

284
00:16:55,550 --> 00:16:59,570
piece of the card so you know just smear

285
00:16:59,570 --> 00:17:04,010
it well over the the surface and then

286
00:17:04,010 --> 00:17:07,490
you you put that put the end flash into

287
00:17:07,490 --> 00:17:10,180
the gully glue it down

288
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:13,630
and then close the piece and and shut

289
00:17:13,630 --> 00:17:16,660
the base and so what you get with this

290
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:22,089
is a an asymmetric curving shape these

291
00:17:22,089 --> 00:17:24,640
aren't these these pop-ups with straight

292
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,830
edges these are rigid shapes that you

293
00:17:26,830 --> 00:17:29,740
can build on easily this type is a it's

294
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:32,620
not a it's not a rigid shape it bounces

295
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:34,060
around so these aren't good for

296
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:36,520
structure they're good for decoration or

297
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:39,400
you can stick small pieces onto them

298
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:42,850
that all just up at interesting angles

299
00:17:42,850 --> 00:17:46,270
but they're not they're not structures

300
00:17:46,270 --> 00:17:51,820
for for extending like like the like the

301
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:53,920
rigid shapes so yeah you know you can

302
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:56,100
have pieces like this that are just out

303
00:17:56,100 --> 00:18:00,190
you can have pieces like like this sort

304
00:18:00,190 --> 00:18:05,080
of jutting out that come up at the

305
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:06,820
interesting angles so you can play

306
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:08,380
around with them like that but you

307
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:10,690
cannot build you cannot build rigid

308
00:18:10,690 --> 00:18:13,750
structures under them so that's

309
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:16,120
asymmetric parallel form so I'll just

310
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:23,410
show you a couple of examples oh this is

311
00:18:23,410 --> 00:18:25,450
yeah this is another another more

312
00:18:25,450 --> 00:18:28,710
extreme example of that one we just made

313
00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:33,070
and then this was one I made this is

314
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:36,460
some this is an asymmetric parallel form

315
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:38,410
so it's got a big window cut in it

316
00:18:38,410 --> 00:18:40,360
there's another asymmetric parallel form

317
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:42,130
underneath it and then this is another

318
00:18:42,130 --> 00:18:44,830
asymmetric parallel forms built into

319
00:18:44,830 --> 00:18:47,200
this gully here so if you actually look

320
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:50,200
at it and on you you can see how this is

321
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:53,410
both the the inner brown one and the

322
00:18:53,410 --> 00:18:55,390
bigger green one they're both built into

323
00:18:55,390 --> 00:18:58,240
the gully created by the car so this is

324
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:01,180
this is the asymmetric parallel fold in

325
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:03,220
action and then I've got a very small

326
00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:07,600
one I can show you in this book bow-wow

327
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:11,680
by Chuck Murphy and in this case it's

328
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:16,180
underneath the circle and you open it at

329
00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:18,550
the top this is just this is a v-fold

330
00:19:18,550 --> 00:19:21,730
the cyclist but the dog the structure

331
00:19:21,730 --> 00:19:23,440
the dog is a

332
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:25,480
loading plain this is a dog floating

333
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:29,590
parallel with with the base sheet but if

334
00:19:29,590 --> 00:19:32,200
you look at it end on you'll see that

335
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:34,330
there's an asymmetric parallel folds

336
00:19:34,330 --> 00:19:36,490
used to raise a parallelogram and the

337
00:19:36,490 --> 00:19:37,870
dog is stuck to the top of the

338
00:19:37,870 --> 00:19:40,330
parallelogram so that's an example of

339
00:19:40,330 --> 00:19:43,539
using asymmetric parallel files to raise

340
00:19:43,539 --> 00:19:47,559
a floating plane so that's it for this

341
00:19:47,559 --> 00:19:51,450
this tutorial and everything I've said

342
00:19:51,450 --> 00:19:55,149
is explained in this book pop-up design

343
00:19:55,149 --> 00:19:57,250
and paper mechanics it's explained in

344
00:19:57,250 --> 00:20:00,380
greater detail

345
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:16,060
